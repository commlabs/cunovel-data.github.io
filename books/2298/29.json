Neither was smiling. Arnie was holding a thick canvas bag. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll let you know,\" Ned said in a tone she had never heard before. \"Why don\u0027t you tell us what happened to you last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s heart skipped a beat. \"Oh, that. It was nothing, just an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching into the canvas bag, Arnie pulled out a set of heavy silver manacles and held them up. \"Really? What kind of accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, her mind racing. What should she say? They would never believe the truth. But she didn\u0027t like them thinking what they were obviously thinking, either. She blew out a breath. \"I have nothing to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell! Something went on last night,\" Ned said, \"and I want to know what it was and who else was involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki crossed her arms over her chest. \"It wasn\u0027t anything for the police to get involved in. No one else was hurt.\" She swallowed hard, thinking of the four dead men. \"I made a stupid mistake. If you want to arrest me for that, fine, go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNed stared at her, his eyes narrowed. \"The old house out at the Hollow burned to the ground last night. Would you be knowing anything about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNed swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie gave her a hard look, then dropped the manacles back into the bag. \"I don\u0027t know what happened,\" he said, his voice grim, \"but you aren\u0027t doing yourself or anyone else a favor by refusing to talk to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ve got nothing to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you change your mind,\" Ned said flatly, \"give us a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stared after them as they left the room. Maybe she should have told them the truth, she mused, then shook her head. If she started going on about vampires and vampire hunters, they\u0027d think she was insane. Instead of lying in a hospital bed, she would probably find herself in a padded room. So, instead of them thinking she was insane, now they probably thought she was involved in some sort of kinky sex. She wasn\u0027t crazy about that idea either. Crazy, she thought, that was definitely the right word for the way her life had been going lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. Maybe she should tell Ned and Arnie the truth. They needed to know what they were up against. But even if they knew, what could they do about it? If a vampire hunter couldn\u0027t find Falco, what chance did Ned and Arnie have? She weighed the pros and cons until her head ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEager to think of something else, she turned on the TV and lost herself in the antics of an old I Love Lucy rerun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dinner tray arrived an hour later, and then one of the nurses came in to take her for a walk down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue, Gus, and Mrs. Heath all called to see how she was doing. Bert Summers came by to talk to her, anxious for a scoop. She told him the story she had concocted, that she had fallen in the vacant lot outside of town and cut her neck on an old piece of barbed wire. She wasn\u0027t sure if he believed her or not, but she was certain he wouldn\u0027t believe the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the sun set, Antonio strolled into her room carrying a huge bouquet of red roses with a red balloon heart in the center. Just seeing him made her spirits soar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you\u0027d come,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else would I go when you are here?\" He glanced around the room. \"Where should I put these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antonio, all these flowers must be costing you a fortune. Here, put them on the table by the phone. I\u0027ll ask the nurse to bring me another vase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling a chair up to the bed, he sat down, then reached for her hand. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am now.\" She studied his cheek, noting there were a lot of new blisters. The old burn looked ugly and painful but didn\u0027t look as bad as it had before. \"Does it still hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"When can you leave here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully tomorrow. It\u0027s up to the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not want you to go back to your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Bobbie Sue and Duncan said. They want me to stay at Bobbie\u0027s house with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are living together?\" Antonio asked, a note of surprise in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you wish to do, stay with your friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really, but I don\u0027t want to stay home alone, either, not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are welcome to come and stay with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stared at him. \"Stay with you? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At my house in Maine. I think you would like it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been to Maine. What\u0027s your house like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a castle of sorts, though not as large as most. The house sits in the middle of several acres of land, most of it heavily wooded. A very wealthy man had it brought over fromEngland for his bride some three hundred years ago. He thought it would please her, but the poor girl fell down a flight of stairs and broke her neck. Some say she fell because she was frightened by the ghost of the castle\u0027s former mistress. Some say it was because her husband pushed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never believed in ghosts,\" Vicki mused. And then she looked at Antonio and smiled. \"But then, I never used to believe in vampires, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, he touched the bandage at her neck. \"I am sorry you had to learn of us in such a painful manner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. But then, if it weren\u0027t for Falco, I never would have met you, would I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not. Or perhaps fate would have managed to bring us together sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to think so. Is there really a ghost? Have you ever seen it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she try to hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She is a lovely, lonely soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you really saw her? Did she speak to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We are kindred spirits, Lady Kathryn and I. We have spent many a lonely night keeping each other company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stared at him, not knowing whether to believe him or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you come with me to Maine, Victoria? I can protect you there until Duncan destroys Falco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered at the mention of the vampire\u0027s name. \"What if he follows us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My home is well protected. He will not be able to enter… \" Antonio looked at her, one brow raised, \"so long as no one invites him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it was foolish of me, what I did. But it never occurred to me that he would come to my house disguised as Darth Vader, of all things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you know better. You will not make that mistake again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s for sure!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will come with me, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027d love to see your castle. And your ghost.\" She blew out a sigh. Talking about ghosts made her think of the four men Falco had hypnotized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio squeezed her hand. \"What is it that troubles you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police came to see me today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wanted to know how I got hurt. They had the manacles Falco used. I didn\u0027t know what to tell them, so I didn\u0027t tell them anything. What should I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did the right thing. Telling the police about Falco will only start a panic. Even though people claim that they do not believe we exist, given the right catalyst, they can soon turn into a mindless mob eager for blood. I have seen it happen before,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many times. When it happens, innocent people die. Sometimes, ignorance is best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will leave as soon as… \" He glanced over his shoulder at the sound of footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki followed his gaze, and a moment later Bobbie Sue and Duncan entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Bobbie Sue said. \"Saints be praised, you\u0027re looking a lot better tonight. How are you feeling, hon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better, thanks. Why aren\u0027t you at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gus gave me an hour off so\u0027s I could come and visit you. He acts so tough, but he\u0027s just an old softie, you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded. Everyone in town knew Gus was a soft touch. He contributed to every charity known to man, bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, supported the local Boy Scout troop, donated money to the hospital building fund and the PTA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Duncan, who was staring at Antonio. Only then did she feel the tension in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Bobbie Sue felt it, too. Tugging on Duncan \u0027s arm, she said, \"Come on, Tom, I think we should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted softly. \"I\u0027ll wait for you outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue bent down to give Vicki a hug. \"Don\u0027t worry about anything, hon,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything will work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Bobbie Sue, I\u0027m going away with Antonio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue\u0027s eyes grew wide. \"You are? When? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as I get out of here. Because I want to. I need you to tell Gus for me, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust tell him I\u0027m taking my vacation a few months early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure, but\"— Bobbie Sue lowered her voice—\"are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, I know you\u0027re attracted to Antonio and everything, but Vicki, he\u0027s a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know,\" Vicki replied dryly. \"I\u0027ll call you, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you know what you\u0027re doing, hon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\" Reaching up with her free arm, she gave Bobbie Sue a hug. \"Just be sure you know what you\u0027re doing, you know, with Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue grinned. \"We sure picked a pair, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Night, Vicki. Antonio.\" With a wave and a smile, Bobbie Sue left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were alone again, Antonio again took Victoria \u0027s hand in his. \"So, you will come with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"How soon do you think we should leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow night. Can you be ready by then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut later that night, alone in bed, when doubts and fears are the strongest, she couldn\u0027t help wondering if she was putting distance between herself and a killer or walking blindly into the lion\u0027s den. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-29.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
