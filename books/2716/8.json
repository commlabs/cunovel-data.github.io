We were talking to a guy named Jay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously? His name is Jay? That is so close to James. Is that not a sign that he was meant to be my first, or what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you seen my sister since then?” she asks hopefully. “Here somewhere?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us shake our heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe she’s still with…Jay?” I say. “My Jay,” I want to add but don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl sighs. “Do you mind if I sit down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, sweetie, take a load off,” Liz says, pulling in her knees to make room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Ali,” she says. “And my sister is not with Jay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” I ask hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. “I went by his room this morning. She wasn’t with him. I asked him where she was and he said he had no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s good news, right? “But didn’t she go off with him last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says she didn’t,” the girl says. “But that doesn’t make sense. She never came back to the room. Her bed is still made. Where else could she be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz pats her arm. “Maybe she met some other guy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure that’s it. She probably met some guy and went back to his room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But that’s so unlike her! I mean, she liked Jay; why would she just hook up with someone else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure she’s around somewhere,” Liz says, continuing to pat the girl’s arm. “Do you want me to help you look for her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you? I’d really appreciate it. It’s just the two of us, and I’m getting a little freaked out—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No worries,” Liz says, tying on her wrap. “I’m happy to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want us to come?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you guys stay here in case…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carly,” Ali says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In case Carly turns up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you creeped out?” Hailey says to me as Liz and the new girl head to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you creeped out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?” I ask, truly clueless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls her legs into a cross-legged position. “Um, the fact that her sister was with Jay last night and disappeared?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Jay told her Carly wasn’t with him,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, he said that, but what if he’s lying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “Why would he lie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He would lie if he did something to her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like many things! Something bad! Gotten her drunk, robbed her, or thrown her over the boat railing. He could be a killer. We don’t know anything about him except that he’s good-looking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not true,” I say. “We think that he has no children. That he enjoys female company. We know he’s here for a wedding, and that he goes to Penn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he says. Don’t you think it’s all a little weird? The girl he was with last night is missing. And…come to think of it, what happened to the girl from the hot tub? I haven’t seen her around either.” She turns white. “Omigod.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The story about the vampire. What if he’s the vampire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost laugh. “Oh, come on. Jay is not a vampire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He could be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Jay is not a vampire. “No he can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes he can! Think about it.” She rubs her temples. “We only see him at night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not true. We saw him in the hot tub. That was during the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, right.” Her forehead creases. “But it was indoors! Ha! No direct sunlight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think it’s a joke, but he could be dangerous. If I were you I would stay clear of him. Don’t let him try to get you alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him? At this point I can’t force him to be alone with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later Liz is back, looking satisfied. “All good,” she says, lying back down in her chair. “Sister found.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHailey claps. “Seriously?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.” She reaches into her bag and reapplies her sunblock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHailey sighs. “Thank god. Where was she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She got up early and went to the spa. Ali must have been sleeping when she left the room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I thought her bed was made?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-8.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
