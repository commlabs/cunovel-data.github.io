Flames shot back up his arms and an invisible wind blew his hair in brownish-black swirls around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong? Is that a friend\u0027s house?\" How crappy if another ally been in collusion with Szilagyi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Vlad\u0027s tone dripped acid. \"It\u0027s my former home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the smell indicated that the stable recently contained horses, all the stalls were empty, to Marty\u0027s dismay. Since he\u0027d been drained and hadn\u0027t been allowed to feed in a week, he truly was hungry enough to eat a horse, making me glad none of the beautiful animals were here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe weren\u0027t in the stables anymore, though. We were about a quarter mile away in Rend\u0027s car, the heater turned on full blast. He\u0027d parked it inside a nearby tree line, still giving us a clear view of the stables so that we\u0027d see when Vlad\u0027s people showed up. It was also a safer place to wait if unwelcome vampires arrived. After searching Rend\u0027s incoming and outgoing cell log, it looked like he checked in around every four hours, but what if he\u0027d been expected to report to Szilagyi sooner about his \"progress\" with me? I intended to search through his bones to see if I could find that out, and find out whether or not Maximus, Shrapnel, and any others survived the fight. First, Marty explained to me that Castle Poenari was the home Vlad rebuilt during his initial reign as Prince of Wallachia-and the same place where his wife killed herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if those memories wouldn\u0027t be enough to keep him away, the ruins of Castle Poenari were also another Dracula tourist attraction. Much as I hated Szilagyi, I had to admire his cleverness. Of all the ruins Vlad had his people searching, they probably avoided ones where the Dracula legend was hawked like snake oil because they shared Vlad\u0027s loathing of that. Plus, who would\u0027ve expected Szilagyi to make his underground nest in the former home of the vampire he was trying to kill? Twisted didn\u0027t even begin to cover it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am so Googling \u0027Vlad Dracul\u0027 once this is all over,\" I stated. \"Wikipedia knows more about his past than I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty grunted. \"You won\u0027t like what you find.\" Then his look became jaded. \"Especially since you\u0027re sleeping with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheek heated but I didn\u0027t glance away. \"Szi-lagyi told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my nose did. When we were in the trunk together, I could smell him on you even over the chloroform Rend dosed you with. They did, too. That\u0027s probably why they didn\u0027t believe that you\u0027d really betrayed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They knew before,\" I replied, shrugging. \"I told Szilagyi that Vlad seduced me to further cement me to his side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t surprise me a bit,\" Marty muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. \"It should because it\u0027s not true. Look, I don\u0027t blame you for disliking Vlad. He impaled you and coerced you-both unforgivable. Still, there\u0027s another side to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Marty replied flatly. \"The side that burns people to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to reply, and then paused. Now wasn\u0027t the time to defend my relationship with Vlad. I\u0027d have to continue this conversation later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the skull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed it over and I took my glove off, grimacing. In true death, Rend had shriveled so much that he looked mummified, but enough bits of skin and hair clung to the skull to make touching it unappealing. Still, I ran my right hand over it. As expected, Rend\u0027s worst sin made his torturing me look innocent by comparison. The next memory was his death-always a standout event for people-and I felt dark satisfaction seeing it replay before me. Then came countless images as his life passed in front of my eyes with incomprehensible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscovering Maximus, Shrapnel, and the other guards\u0027 fates plus finding out if Rend was supposed to check in sooner than normal with Szilagyi would be like looking for specific snowflakes in an avalanche, but I had to try. Everything I needed to know had happened earlier today. I\u0027d start at Rend\u0027s last memory and then work my way backward, if possible. I rubbed his skull, trying to will forth the image of his death. It flickered in front of me before fading, replaced by another unintelligible mess. I tried again, concentrating, and the dark blue interior of the car abruptly fell away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cord of pure white lashed out, slicing through Rend\u0027s shoulders as easily as a sword through water . . . Me, streaked with blood, writhing under the point of an ivory knife . . . Marty\u0027s anguish as silver knives drove into his flesh . . . Me and Marty in a trunk, him restrained with silver, me with rope . . . A large hall decorated in pastel hues, its opulence marred by glass, blood, and multiple bodies on the ground . . . Two vampires being forced into a van, both of them pierced with silver harpoons. One was bald and dark-skinned, the other pale with shoulder-length blond hair . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re alive!\" I shouted, so excited I dropped the link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell that already?\" Marty asked in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a point. I\u0027d spent days unsuccessfully trying to glean more details from the bones of the vampires who\u0027d attacked the club. Why were Rend\u0027s memories so much easier to navigate? Only one thing had changed since then. Like a magnifying glass could amplify a ray of sunshine, drinking large quantities of vampire blood must kick my psychic abilities into hyper drive. I\u0027d already seen what it did to my voltage, but I hadn\u0027t expected it to affect my other powers. I didn\u0027t want to dwell on the ramifications of that because it brought up possibilities I wasn\u0027t ready to consider. Instead, I touched Rend\u0027s skull again, focusing my energy on that last image I\u0027d seen of Maximus and Shrapnel. It took two tries, but once I found it, I centered my attention on seeing what came before that . . . and before that . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a gasp that had Marty demanding, \"What, what?\" while shaking me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the link-and the skull-to grasp Marty\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to go to Castle Poenari.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch it, for God\u0027s sake! You\u0027ll get us killed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll get me killed. You\u0027re already dead,\" I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so I\u0027d almost sideswiped another car, but for my first time driving, I was doing pretty well. I hit the gas, ignoring the glare Marty shot my way. Yes, I was speeding, but we were in a hurry. Besides, he had a lead foot, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be all the way dead when Vlad realizes what you\u0027re doing and blames me for not stopping you,\" Marty said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to use Rend\u0027s cell so Vlad couldn\u0027t read my thoughts when I called him an hour ago. I told him I\u0027d glimpsed something from Rend\u0027s bones that made me think it was best to leave immediately instead of waiting for his people to get us, and that I\u0027d see him later at the castle. Both things were true. I just hadn\u0027t mentioned what I\u0027d glimpsed or which castle I\u0027d meet him at. If I had, he would have ordered his men to drag me back to his home using any force necessary, and that wouldn\u0027t do. As I\u0027d told him before, I wanted revenge against Szilagyi, too. Right now, I was on my way to get it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-63.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
