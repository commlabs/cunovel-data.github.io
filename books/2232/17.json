The rising road offered stunning vistas of nearby tawny hillsides thick with summer rock roses, lavender, and thyme. The lofty ruins of a fortress, its charred walls standing like gaunt fingers, rose in the distance. The land, as far as the eye could see, oozed the romance of history when marauding knights swooped like eagles from the fortified heights to prey on their foe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Stephanie had left Copenhagen around four AM and flown to Paris, where they caught the first Air France shuttle of the day south for Toulouse. An hour later they were on the ground and motoring southwest into the region known as the Languedoc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way Stephanie told him about the village that stood fifteen hundred feet atop the bleak mound they were now climbing. Gauls were the first to inhabit the hilltop, drawn by the prospect of being able to see for miles across the expansive Aude River valley. But it was the Visigoths in the fifth century who built a citadel and adopted the ancient Celtic name for the location--Rhedae, which meant \"chariot\"--eventually developing the place into a trading center. Two hundred years later, when the Visigoths were driven south into Spain, the Franks converted Rhedae into a royal city. By the thirteenth century, though, the town\u0027s status had declined, and toward the end of the Albigensian Crusade it was razed. Ownership passed through several wealthy houses of both France and Spain, eventually resting with one of Simon de Montfort\u0027s lieutenants, who founded a barony. The family built themselves a chateau, around which a tiny hamlet sprouted, and the name eventually changed from Rhedae to Rennes-le-Chateau. Their issue ruled the land and the town until 1781, when the last heir, Marie d\u0027Hautpoul de Blanchefort, died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before her death, it was said that she passed on a great secret,\" Stephanie had said, \"one that her family kept for centuries. She was childless and her husband died before her, so with no one left, she told the secret to her confessor, the abbe Antoine Bigou, who was the parish priest for Rennes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as Malone stared ahead at the last bend in the narrow road, he imagined what it must have been like to live then in such a remote place. The isolated valleys formed a perfect repository for both fleeing fugitives and restless pilgrims. Easy to see why the region had become a theme park for the imagination, a mecca for mystery buffs and new agers, a place where writers with a unique vision could forge a reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Lars Nelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town came into view. He slowed the car and eased through a gate framed by limestone pillars. A sign warned FOUILLES INTERDITES. Excavating prohibited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had to post a notice about digging?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie nodded. \"Years ago, people were shoveling dirt in every corner looking for treasure. Even dynamiting. It had to be regulated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaylight dimmed beyond the town gate. The limestone buildings were packed tight, like books on a shelf, many with pitched roofs, thick doors, and rusted iron verandas. A narrow and flinty grand rue wound up a short incline. People with backpacks and Michelin Green Guides hugged the walls on either side, parading single-file back and forth. Malone saw a couple of stores, a bookshop, and a restaurant. Alleys led off the main rue to nests of buildings, but not many. The entire town was less than five hundred yards across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only about a hundred people live here full time,\" Stephanie said. \"Though fifty thousand visit each year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lars had quite an effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than I ever realized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed ahead and directed him to turn left. They eased past kiosks peddling rosaries, medals, pictures, and souvenirs to more camera-toting visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come by the busload,\" she said. \"Wanting to believe in the impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp another incline and he parked the Peugeot in a sandy lot. Two buses were already there, their drivers milling about smoking. A water tower rose to one side, its tattered stone adorned with a zodiac sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crowds come early,\" Stephanie said as they climbed out. \"Here to see the domaine d\u0027Abbe Sauniere. The priest\u0027s domain--what he built with all that mysterious treasure he supposedly found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone stepped close to a waist-high rock wall. The panorama below, a patchwork of field, forest, valley, and rock, stretched for miles. The silver-green hills were dotted with chestnut and oak. He checked his bearings. The great bulk of the snowcapped Pyrenees blocked the southern horizon. A stiff wind howled from the west, thankfully warmed by the summer sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced to the right. A hundred feet away the neo-Gothic tower, with its crenellated roof and single round turret, had graced the cover of many a book and tourist brochure. It stood on the edge of a cliff, grim and defiant, seemingly clinging to rock. A long belvedere stretched from its far side and rounded back toward an iron glasshouse, then to another cluster of olden stone buildings, each topped with orange-tiled roofs. People milled back and forth on the ramparts, cameras in hand, admiring the valleys below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tower is the Tour Magdala. Quite a sight, isn\u0027t it?\" Stephanie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems out of place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I always thought, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the right of the Magdala rose an ornamental garden that led to a compact Renaissance-style building that also seemed from another locale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Villa Bethanie,\" she said. \"Sauniere built it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted the name. Bethany. \"That\u0027s biblical. In the Holy Land. It meant \u0027house with an answer.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Sauniere was clever with names.\" She pointed to more buildings behind them. \"Lars\u0027s house is down that alley. Before we head there, I have to do something. As we walk, let me tell you about what happened here in 1891. What I read about last week. What brought this place back from obscurity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abbe Berenger Sauniere pondered the daunting task before him. The Church of Mary Magdalene had been built upon Visigoth ruins and consecrated in 1059. Now, eight centuries later, the inside was in ruin, thanks to a roof that leaked as if it weren\u0027t there. The walls themselves were crumbling, the foundations slipping away. It would take both patience and stamina to repair the damage, but he thought himself up to the task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a husky man, muscular, broad-shouldered, with a head of close-cropped black hair. His one endearing feature, which he used to his advantage, was the cleft in his chin. It added a whimsical air to the stiff countenance of his black eyes and thick eyebrows. Born and raised a few miles away, in the village of Montazels, he knew the geography of the Corbieres well. From childhood he\u0027d been familiar with Rennes-le-Chateau. Its church, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, had been in limited use for decades, and he\u0027d never imagined that one day its many problems would be his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mess,\" the man known as Rousset said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the mason. \"I agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mason, Babou, was busy shoring up one of the walls. The region\u0027s state architect had recently recommended that the building be razed, but Sauniere would never allow that to happen. Something about the old church demanded that it be saved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will take much money to complete the repairs,\" Rousset said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enormous amounts of money.\" He added a smile to let the older man know that he understood the challenge. \"But we shall make this house worthy of the Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he did not say was that he\u0027d already secured a fair amount of funds. A bequest from one of his predecessors had left six hundred francs especially for repairs. He\u0027d also managed to convince the town council to loan him another fourteen hundred francs. But the bulk of his money had come in secret five years ago. Three thousand francs had been donated by the countess of Chambord, the widow of Henri, the last Bourbon claimant to the defunct French throne. At the time Sauniere had managed to bring a great deal of attention to himself with anti-republican sermons, ones that stirred monarchist feelings in his parishioners. The government reeled from the comments, withdrawing his yearly stipend and demanding that he be fired. Instead the bishop suspended him for nine months, but his actions caught the attention of the countess, who\u0027d made contact through an intermediary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do we start?\" Rousset asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d given that matter a great deal of thought. The stained-glass windows had already been replaced and a new porch, outside the main entrance, would be completed shortly. Certainly the north wall, where Babou was working, must be mended, a new pulpit installed, and the roof replaced. But he knew where they must start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will begin with the altar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curious look came to Rousset\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people\u0027s focus is there,\" Sauniere said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, Abbe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked the respect his older parishioners showed him, though he was only thirty-eight. Over the past five years he\u0027d come to like Rennes. He was near home, with plenty of opportunities to study Scriptures and perfect his Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He also enjoyed trekking in the mountains, fishing, and hunting. But the time had come to do something constructive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approached the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top was white marble pitted by water that had rained down for centuries from the porous ceiling. The slab was supported by two ornate columns, their exteriors adorned with Visigoth crosses and Greek letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall replace the top and the pillars,\" he declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How, Abbe?\" Rousset asked. \"There is no way we can lift that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to where Babou stood. \"Use the sledgehammer. There is no need for delicacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBabou brought the heavy tool over and surveyed his task. Then, with a great heave, Babou hoisted the hammer and crashed it down onto the center of the altar. The thick top cracked, but the stone did not give way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s solid,\" Babou said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again,\" Sauniere said with a flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blow and the limestone shattered, the two halves collapsing into each other between the still standing pillars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finish,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two pieces were quickly busted into many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent down. \"Let\u0027s haul all this away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get it, Abbe,\" Babou said, setting the sledgehammer aside. \"You pile it for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men lifted large chunks and headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it around to the cemetery and stack it. We should have use for it there,\" he called out to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they left, he noticed that both pillars had survived the demolition. With a swipe he cleared dust and debris away from the crown of one. On the other a piece of limestone still lay, and, when he tossed the chunk into the pile, he noticed beneath, in the crown of the pillar, a shallow mortise hole. The space was no bigger than the palm of his hand, surely designed to hold the top\u0027s locking pin, but inside the cavity he caught sight of a glimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent close and carefully blew away the dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, something was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glass vial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much longer than his index finger and only slightly wider, the top sealed with crimson wax. He looked close and saw that the vessel contained a rolled piece of paper. He wondered how long it had been there. He was not aware of any recent work done to the altar, so it must have been secreted there a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe freed the object from its hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That vial started everything,\" Stephanie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone nodded. \"I read Lars\u0027s books, too. But I thought Sauniere was supposed to have found three parchments in that pillar with some sort of coded messages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"That\u0027s all part of the myth others added to the story. This, Lars and I did talk about. Most of the fallacies were started in the fifties by a Rennes innkeeper who wanted to generate business. One lie built on another. Lars never accepted that those parchments were real. Their supposed text was printed in countless books, but no one has ever seen them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did he write about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To sell books. I know it bothered him, but he did it anyway. He always said that whatever wealth Sauniere found could be traced to 1891 and whatever was inside that glass vial. But he was the only one who believed that.\" She pointed off to another of the stone buildings. \"That\u0027s the presbytery where Sauniere lived. It\u0027s a museum about him now. The pillar with the small niche is in there for all to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed the crowded kiosks and kept to the rough-paved street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Church of Mary Magdalene,\" she said, pointing at a Romanesque building. \"Once the chapel for the local counts. Now, for a few euros, you can see the great creation of Abbe Sauniere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t approve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I never did. That was the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to their right he saw a tumbled-down chateau, its mud-colored outer walls baked by the sun. \"That\u0027s the Hautpouls estate,\" she said. \"It was lost during the Revolution to the government and has been a mess ever since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rounded the far end of the church and passed beneath a stone gateway that bore what looked like a skull and crossbones. He recalled from the book he\u0027d read last night that the symbol appeared on many Templar gravestones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earth beyond the entrance was littered with pebbles. He knew what the French called the space. Enclos paroissiaux. Parish close. And the enclosure seemed typical--one side bounded by a low wall, the other nestled close to a church, its entrance a triumphal arch. The cemetery hosted a profusion of table tombs, headstones, and memorials. Floral tributes topped some of the graves, and many were adorned, in the French tradition, with photographs of the deceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie walked to one of the monuments that displayed neither flowers nor images, and Malone let her go alone. He knew that Lars Nelle had been so liked by the locals that they\u0027d granted him the privilege of being buried in their cherished churchyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headstone was simple and noted only the name, dates, and an epitaph of HUSBAND, FATHER, SCHOLAR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased up beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They never once wavered in burying him here,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what she meant. In sacred ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mayor at the time said there was no conclusive evidence he killed himself. He and Lars were close, and he wanted his friend buried here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the perfect place,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was hurting, he knew, but to recognize her pain would be viewed as an invasion of her privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made a lot of mistakes with Lars,\" she said. \"And most of them eventually cost me with Mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage is tough.\" His own failed through selfishness, too. \"So is parenthood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always thought Lars\u0027s passion silly. I was a government lawyer doing important things. He was searching for the impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze stayed on the grave. \"I\u0027ve come to realize that I owe him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or do you owe yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from the grave. \"Perhaps I do owe us both,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let it drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie pointed to a far corner. \"Sauniere\u0027s mistress is buried there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone knew about the mistress from Lars\u0027s books. She was sixteen years Sauniere\u0027s junior, a mere eighteen when she quit her job as a hatmaker and became the abbe\u0027s housekeeper. She stayed by his side for thirty-one years, until his death in 1917. Everything Sauniere acquired was eventually placed in her name, including all of his land and bank accounts, which subsequently made it impossible for anyone, including the Church, to claim them. She continued to live in Rennes, dressing in somber clothes and behaving as strangely as when her lover was alive, until her death in 1953.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was an odd one,\" Stephanie said. \"She made a statement, long after Sauniere died, about how with what he left behind you could feed all of Rennes for a hundred years, but she lived in poverty till the day she died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any one ever learn why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her only statement was, I cannot touch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought you didn\u0027t know much about all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t, until last week. The books and journal were informative. Lars spent a lot of time interviewing locals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like that would have been double or triple hearsay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Sauniere, that\u0027s true. He\u0027s been dead a long time. But his mistress lived till the fifties, so there were many still around in the seventies and eighties who knew her. She sold the Villa Bethanie in 1946 to a man named Noel Corbu. He was the one who converted it into a hotel--the innkeeper I mentioned who made up much of the false information about Rennes. The mistress promised to tell Sauniere\u0027s great secret to Corbu, but at the end of her life she suffered a stroke and was unable to communicate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey trudged across the hard ground, grit crunching with every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sauniere was once buried here, too, beside her, but the mayor said the grave was in danger from treasure hunters.\" She shook her head. \"So a few years ago they dug the priest up and moved him into a mausoleum in the garden. Now it costs three euros to see his grave . . . the price of a corpse\u0027s safety, I assume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed at the grave. \"I remember coming here once years ago. When Lars first arrived in the late sixties, nothing but two tattered crosses marked the graves, overgrown with vines. No one tended to them. No one cared. Sauniere and his lover were totally forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn iron chain encircled the plot and fresh flowers sprouted from concrete vases. Malone noticed the epitaph on one of the stones, barely legible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHERE LIES BERENGER SAUNIERE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePARISH PRIEST OF RENNES-LE-CHATEAU\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1853-1917\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDIED 22 JANUARY 1917 AGED 64\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read somewhere that the marker was too fragile to move,\" she said, \"so they left it. More for the tourists to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed the mistress\u0027s gravestone. \"She wasn\u0027t a target of opportunists, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently not, since they left her here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t it a scandal, their relationship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Whatever wealth Sauniere acquired, he spread around. The water tower back at the car park? He built it for the town. He also paved roads, repaired houses, made loans to people in trouble. So he was forgiven whatever weakness he may have possessed. And it was not uncommon for priests of that time to have female housekeepers. Or at least that\u0027s what Lars wrote in one of his books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of noisy visitors rounded the corner behind them and headed for the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here they come to gawk,\" Stephanie said, a touch of contempt in her voice. \"I wonder if they would act that way back home, in the cemetery where their loved ones are buried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boisterous crowd drew close, and a tour guide started talking about the mistress. Stephanie retreated and Malone followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is nothing but an attraction to them,\" Stephanie said in a low voice. \"Where the abbe Sauniere found his treasure and supposedly decorated his church with messages that somehow led the way to it.
