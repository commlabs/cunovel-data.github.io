This face veil had never been lifted by any opponent’s attack or true essence aftermath. This was the symbol of Jing Chanyu’s tranquility, and also the reason that almost everyone had unanimously recognized her as the one would who seize the title of champion amongst the 36 countries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis young girl had left an unfathomably deep feeling in everyone’s heart!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You are very strong.

When he had been fighting against Bi Tinghua, Lin Ming had been gone easy on him.

Now that Lin Ming’s soul attacks no longer work, how else will he fight?” The one who spoke was a minor martial artist who was one of the few that had bet on Lin Ming to win. He believed that the odds were good, but now looking at the situation, it was a possibility that they he would lose everything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, you should have bet on Jing Chanyu. Although you might not have earned as much, the chances were much higher. A soul attack simply isn’t the proper way of doing this. The only reason that Lin Ming was able to arrive here with his trivial peak Bone Forging cultivation was because he was relying on his soul attack trickery. His opponents were martial artists that didn’t know how to defend against soul attacks, so they were caught off guard. Otherwise, how could Pulse Condensation period martial artists lose to a boy at the peak of Bone Forging? That Bi Tinghua was also stupid. Obviously he had some martial skills, so why would he want to compare soul attacks with Lin Ming. If he fought Lin Ming in a head-to-head martial arts contest, how could he possibly lose?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Now that Lin Ming has encountered a martial artist who is proficient in soul force defense, there are no other tricks that Lin Ming can pull!” The martial artist who spoke was in a good mood.
