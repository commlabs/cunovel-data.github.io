Both his father and mother were surprised to see him back so soon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am glad you came home early,” said his mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did you see anything of Gilbert while you were out?” asked his father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you suppose, Mr. Briggs, that Randolph is going to follow your beggarly ward?” demanded Mrs. Briggs, sharply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He might have met him,” said her husband, in an apologetic tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I did meet him,” said Randolph, in so significant a tone that both his father and mother looked at him for an explanation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where do you think I saw him?” continued Randolph.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 69“In some low place,” suggested his mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not at all. He was eating an ice-cream at Delmonico’s.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Pretty well for a penniless boy!” said Mrs. Briggs. “I suppose he expects us to supply him with money to pay for his extravagant outlays.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, he didn’t pay for it himself. He got Mr. Vivian to treat him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mr. Vivian!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes: he had picked up Mr. Vivian and Laura somewhere, and probably suggested going in to take an ice-cream.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No doubt Mr. Vivian invited him,” said Mr. Briggs, who did not allow dislike to run away with his common-sense.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is certainly the most forward and impudent boy I ever met,” exclaimed Mrs. Briggs, whose annoyance arose largely from Gilbert’s succeeding better with the Vivians than her own son.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Really, my dear,” expostulated her husband, “I am sure you do the boy injustice.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t call me ‘my dear,’” said Mrs. Briggs, 70scornfully. “I can’t see what has got into you. You certainly must be wilfully blind if you don’t see through the artfulness of that boy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What has he done?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He has wormed himself into the intimacy of Mr. Vivian; that is what he has done.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why shouldn’t he? If Mr. Vivian is inclined to befriend him, it will be a saving to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It won’t be for long. Mr. Vivian will find him out, and cast him off.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know that there is anything in particular to find out. He seems to me as good as the average of boys.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Mr. Briggs, I can only say that you seem infatuated about him. I beg to say that I am not.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is apparent,” said her husband, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Moreover,” added his wife, provoked, “I wish to tell you that it is disagreeable to me to have him in the house. So the sooner you can find a boarding-house for him the better.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I will, if you insist upon it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I do insist upon it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 71“Then I will try in a day or two to find him a home.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mark my words, Mr. Briggs: you will find, sooner or later, that my prejudice against him is not so foolish as you imagine. That boy will turn out badly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I hope not.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s all very well hoping; but you’ll see.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Randolph now got up to go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where are you going, Randolph?” asked his mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am going out a while; I can’t say where.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why can’t you be satisfied to stay at home?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, it’s so stupid staying at home,” said Randolph. “I want to go where there’s something going on.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It isn’t a very good plan for a boy of your age to spend his evenings about the street,” said Mr. Briggs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why shouldn’t he go out?” said Mrs. Briggs, in the spirit of opposition. “You haven’t anything to say about your favorite being out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 72“The city is new to him. If he went out every evening like Randolph, I should think it a bad plan.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I suppose you would find some excuse for him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Really,” said Mr. Briggs, “I shall be quite as anxious to get him out of the house as you, if you keep up such an incessant attack.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If you are going to talk to me in this style, I will retire,” said Mrs. Briggs, stiffly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suiting the action to the word, she rose and left the room. Her husband made no opposition. Indeed, as her temper was, he felt her withdrawal a relief. He settled himself down to the comfortable reading of an evening paper, and had about completed its perusal when the bell rang, and Gilbert entered the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Gilbert, did you have a pleasant time?” asked his guardian.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir; unexpectedly so. I met Mr. Vivian and his daughter, and went to Delmonico’s with them.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You found him an agreeable man, no doubt?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 73“Yes, sir; he treated me very kindly for a stranger.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He has a high reputation,” said Mr. Briggs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is he in business?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes; he is an importer, and is generally considered very wealthy. He is a prudent, conservative man, who avoids dangerous risks, and so meets with few losses.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He has invited me to call next Friday evening at his house.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You had better go, by all means. His friendship may be valuable to you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am glad you approve of my going, for I am sure I shall enjoy it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now, Gilbert,” said Mr. Briggs, clearing his throat, “as we have a good opportunity, I will say a few words about my plans for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wish you would, sir. I am anxious to know what is to be my path in life.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I propose to get you into some store or counting-room in the city.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir. That is what I should like.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 74“And,” continued Mr. Briggs, rather embarrassed, “it will probably be necessary for you to obtain a boarding-place nearer the business part of the city than you would be here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I should think it would be better,” said Gilbert, who decidedly preferred a boarding-house to an establishment presided over by Mrs. Briggs, who, he clearly saw, was not disposed to be his friend.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We have breakfast too late to admit of your getting down-town in time,” continued Mr. Briggs, who seemed to want to justify himself in the eyes of his ward for the inhospitable proposal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir, I think it will be every way better,” said Gilbert, promptly. “What wages do you think I can get, sir?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why,” said Mr. Briggs, hesitating, “beginners like you seldom command more than five dollars a week at first.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gilbert looked serious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I suppose,” he said, “this will not be enough to pay all my expenses.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Certainly not,” said his guardian, “but you 75need not feel troubled about that. I will make up the balance necessary till you are far enough advanced to be self-supporting.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are very kind, sir,” said Gilbert, gratefully; “but it appears that I have already cost you considerable.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, that is of no consequence,” said Mr. Briggs, hurriedly. “I was your father’s friend, and naturally I feel an interest in your progress.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank you, sir; but I don’t like to be a continued burden to you. Do you think it will be long before I can support myself?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It will certainly be two years—perhaps three.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Of course I don’t know anything about it, but I should think my services ought to be worth my board and clothes before that.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We must take things as we find them,” said his guardian. “There are a dozen applicants for every place open to a boy, and while this state of things continues employers will pay low wages. Besides, it is felt that a boy is paid partly in the knowledge of business he acquires.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 76“I have no doubt you are right, sir; but how do poor boys manage who have no one to make up the deficiency?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Some of them have to live on five dollars a week.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Couldn’t I do it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I should not be willing to have you. You have been brought up as a gentleman, and could not get along as well as if you had always been poor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will trust to your judgment, sir; but I shall want you to keep an account of all you spend for me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Because some day I mean to repay it,” said Gilbert, proudly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are too particular about this matter,” said Mr. Briggs, uncomfortably.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, sir, I don’t think so. I think I am old enough now to undertake my entire support.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will see about it, then.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This closed the conversation for the evening. Gilbert was glad to have spoken to his guardian. Now he knew better what to look forward to.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1888/54488.html","bookId":793,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:47:48 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:47:48 AM"}
