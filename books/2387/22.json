The way he’d hung on her words, the way he’d stood up for her in front of his mom—he seemed older, somehow, really mature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared across the dark street. A figure in a blue checked coat was waving at her from Snooker’s, a college bar with Eagles pennants and Pabst Blue Ribbon lamps. He had a wrist brace on his hand and spiky dark hair. When he called her name again, Emily recognized the voice immediately. It was Derrick, her closest friend from the summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” Emily yelped, crossing the street. A driver honked angrily as he swerved to avoid her. “What are you doing here?” she called gleefully to Derrick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taking some classes at Hollis.” Derrick grabbed Emily and engulfed her in a huge hug. He looked her up and down. “Man, you look a little different since I saw you last. What happened to you, anyway? You fell off the face of the earth! We were supposed to hang out back in the summer, but you never showed. Never called, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared down at her sneakers, feeling ashamed. She’d ditched Derrick the day she’d overheard Gayle saying that she was the one who was pregnant. She’d meant to call him later with an update, but she hadn’t gotten around to it. She thought she’d see him at the restaurant, but their schedules had never matched up. A week passed, then another, and suddenly it felt weird to call him. Too much had happened. There was too much to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerrick leaned in closer, giving Emily a concerned look. “How did everything go with the baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shhh.” Emily looked around, terrified one of the passersby on the busy street might hear. “No one knows about that. Especially my parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerrick’s eyebrows shot up. “You still haven’t told them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shook her head. “I didn’t have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I guess you didn’t keep it, then.” Derrick twisted his mouth. “And I know you didn’t give it to Gayle.” He looked wounded. “You know, I should be mad at you. You got me in some deep shit with that woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shivered at the sound of Gayle’s name. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About two weeks after you ditched me, she found me in her garden shed and told me you went back on your word. She was unhinged. She thought I had something to do with it, helped you escape or something. She started throwing stuff at me—a bag of birdseed, a rake, then a shovel. She broke a window—it was insane. I tried to tell her I had no idea what she was talking about, but she didn’t believe me.” He bit his lip. “I’d never seen her so . . . violent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily covered her mouth with her hands. She thought of A’s last note, which all but spelled out how Gayle was searching for the baby. What did Gayle have planned when she found her? Was she going to take her away from the Bakers? And exactly what role was A playing in it all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily felt a presence beside her and looked up. Standing opposite Derrick, with a strange look on his face, was Isaac. “H-hey,” he said cautiously. His eyes flickered to Derrick, then back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh!” Emily blurted a little too loudly. “Isaac! Hey!” She gestured to Derrick. “This is my friend, Derrick. Derrick, this is, uh, Isaac.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerrick’s eyes widened. “Isaac?” Emily remembered that one night last summer, she’d admitted Isaac’s name to Derrick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-we should get going,” Emily said, inserting herself between the two boys. She knew Derrick wouldn’t say anything, but this was just too weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should finish catching up sometime,” Derrick said, patting Emily on the shoulder. “I’ve missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh huh,” Emily said quickly, taking Isaac’s arm and hurrying down the street. “Great to see you, Derrick! Bye!” She felt bad for ditching Derrick again, but she didn’t dare turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed a retro toy store, a bank, and an empty storefront before Isaac cleared his throat. “So who was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Derrick?” Emily chirped innocently, pushing into the ice cream shop. The bells on the door chimed cheerfully. “Oh, he’s just a friend I met last summer in Philly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she gazed hard at the menu board above the counter and started to ramble. “So what are you going to get? I hear the cherry vanilla is really good. Or, ooh, look! Organic rocky road!” If she kept talking, she figured, Isaac wouldn’t be able to get a word in edgewise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up guiltily. In the bright light of the ice cream parlor, Isaac’s eyes looked bluer than ever. He fiddled with a string bracelet around his wrist. “Are you sure you’re all right? You seem really freaked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’m all right!” Emily said, knowing her voice sounded high-pitched and strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t take this the wrong way,” Isaac said, “but did that Derrick guy do something to you? It seemed like you couldn’t wait to get away from him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily searched his face. “Oh my God, no.” It was so funny that she burst out laughing. If only it was that simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line shifted, and Emily and Isaac moved closer to the register. “I care about you, that’s all. I don’t want to see you get hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily kept her gaze fixed on the chrome ice cream scoops behind the counter, her heart breaking from Isaac’s kindness. She wanted him to care about her. “He’s just an old friend I confided in a lot about Ali—that’s probably what you were sensing,” she said haltingly. “There’s nothing weird going on. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” Isaac asked, grabbing Emily’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Positive.” She peered at their entwined fingers. They looked so nice together. Did the baby’s hands look like a combination of theirs? Did the baby have Isaac’s smile, Emily’s freckles? A lump formed in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, well in that case, there was actually something I wanted to ask you about,” Isaac said, looking serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily swallowed hard, suddenly worried he could read her thoughts. “Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac looked into her eyes. “Do you want to go with me to Tom Marin’s fund-raiser ball tomorrow? It sounds fun, and my dad’s company isn’t catering it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh!” Emily said, unable to hide her surprise. She’d intended on going to the fund-raiser alone, especially since she was only going in order to help the girls steal Gayle’s phone. Bringing Isaac would be tricky. What if Gayle said something? What if she took one look at Isaac and knew, somehow, he was the father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Isaac was looking at her nervously, like he’d be crushed if she said no. And before she could stop herself, she blurted out, “Yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great!” Isaac said, looking relived. “It’s a date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily forced a bright smile on her face. She’d never felt so many things at once. Freaked, definitely. Pleased, too—she did want to see Isaac again. But she also hated herself for everything she wasn’t telling him. She was playing a very dangerous game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was their turn to order, and they stepped up to the counter. A motorcycle engine revved, and she glanced at the street out the window. There, across the wide avenue, backlit by the neon sign of the Hollis Liquor Store, stood someone in a black hood, staring at her. At first, she thought it might be Derrick, but this person was smaller, thinner. Emily shot away from Isaac and wound around the tables to get a closer look, but by the time she was at the glass, the figure was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE TOUGHEST DECISION EVER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stood at the window of Ella’s house in Rosewood, peering out at the dark street. She felt a hand on her shoulder and smelled Ella’s familiar patchouli perfume. Her mother wore a paint-spattered artist’s smock and chopsticks in her hair. She’d recently gotten inspiration for a new painting series, and between her new boyfriend, her job at an art gallery in Hollis, and her time in the studio, Aria barely saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you and Noel up to tonight?” she asked, perching on the paisley wing chair she and Byron had bought at a flea market a million years ago. “That’s who you’re waiting for, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lump formed in Aria’s throat. Truthfully, she was hoping Noel wouldn’t show up for their date. That way, Aria wouldn’t have to break up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA’s note had tortured her all day, and she’d debated saying something versus keeping quiet. If she kept the secret, she’d have to end things. On the other hand, if she outed Noel’s father, Noel would hate her and probably break up with her anyway. And how the hell had A found out? How did A know everything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria had no doubt that A would spill Mr. Kahn’s cross-dressing secret if she didn’t act soon. It was bad enough that she still felt like she’d ruined her own family—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe couldn’t ruin Noel’s, too. Only, could she really dump Noel after all they’d been through? She loved him so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at her mom and took a deep breath. “Do you still blame me for what happened between you and Byron?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla blinked hard. “What do you mean, still?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I kept it a secret. If I would have said something to you, maybe you could have . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s mother sank further into the chair cushion. “Honey, your father put you in a horrible position. You should have never had to make the decision to tell or not to tell. Even if you had told me sooner, it wouldn’t have changed anything in the end. It’s not your fault.” She laid a hand on Aria’s thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but you got so mad at me for not saying anything,” Aria mumbled. Ella had kicked her out of the house, and she’d had to live with Sean Ackard, her then-boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla cradled a knitted throw pillow between her hands. “I shouldn’t have reacted like that. I was just so blindsided, and I had to lash out at someone.” She looked up. “I’m sorry, too, honey. You shouldn’t dwell over this. Things happen. And we’re all happier and healthier now, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria nodded, feeling a knot in her stomach. “But if we were to do it all over again, would you rather I told you sooner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla thought about this for a moment, running her finger over her bottom lip. “Maybe not,” she said. “I think I needed to be in the dark, at least for a little while longer. I needed to get strong enough to know what I wanted and realize that I was capable of living on my own. Moving to Iceland, figuring out a new country, that really helped me, but it was because of your father that we went there. So, actually, Aria, if I had known earlier, I never would have gotten that experience. In a weird way, I’m glad I found out when I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria nodded, working this over in her mind. “So you’re saying that if you know a secret about someone, but you also know that someone else isn’t ready to hear it, you should keep it to yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess it depends.” Ella wrinkled her brow, looking suspicious. “Why? Do you know a secret about someone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Aria said quickly. “I was just speaking hypothetically.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stunning-pretty-little-liars-11/page-22.html","bookId":2387,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM"}
