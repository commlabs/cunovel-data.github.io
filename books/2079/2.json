Making noises like Pal did when he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eate his dog food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Rashel was frozen. The whole world had changed and everything seemed like a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she heard somebody screaming and her throat hurt and she knew it was her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the tall man looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head and looked. And she knew that his face alone was going to give her nightmares\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that he was ugly. But he had hair as red as blood and eyes that shone gold, like an animal\u0027s. There\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas a light in them that was like nothing she had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran then. It was wrong to leave Timmy, but she was too scared to stay. She wasn\u0027t brave; she was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebaby, but she couldn\u0027t help it. She was still screaming as she turned around and darted through the flap in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost darted through. Her head and shoulders got outside and she saw the red plastic tubes rising\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabove her-and then a hand clamped on the back of her Gymboree shirt. A big strong hand that stopped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher in midflight. Rashel was as helpless as a baby kitten against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just as she was dragged back into the tent, she saw something. Her mother. Her mother was coming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound the corner of the climbing structure. She\u0027d heard Rashel screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother\u0027s eyes were big and her mouth was open, and she was moving fast. She was coming to save\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommeeeeeeeee!\" Rashel screamed, and then she was back inside the tent. The man threw her to one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eside the way a kid at preschool would throw a piece of crumpled paper. Rashel landed hard and felt a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epain in her leg that normally would have made her cry. Now she hardly noticed it. She was staring at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmy, who was lying on the ground near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmy looked strange. His body was like a rag doll\u0027s-arms and legs flopped out. His skin was white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were staring straight up at the top of the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two big holes in his throat, with blood all around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel whimpered. She was too frightened to scream anymore. But just then she saw white daylight, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea figure in front of it. Mommy. Mommy was pulling the tent flap open. Mommy was inside, looking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound for Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when the worst thing happened. The worst and the strangest, the thing the police never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelieved when Rashel told them later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel saw her mother\u0027s mouth open, saw her mother looking at her, about to say something. And then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe heard a voice-but it wasn\u0027t Mommy\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t an out-loud voice. It was inside her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait! There\u0027s nothing wrong here. But you need to stand very, very still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel looked at the tall man. His mouth wasn\u0027t moving, but the voice was his. Her mother was looking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat him, too, and her expression was changing, becoming relaxed and . . . stupid. Mommy was standing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every, very still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the tall man hit Mommy once on the side of the neck and she fell over and her head flopped the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong way like a broken doll. Her dark hair was lying in the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel saw that and then everything was even more like a dream. Her mother was dead. Timmy was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edead. And the man was looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re not upset, came the voice in her head. You \u0027re not frightened. You want to come right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel could feel the pull of the voice. It was drawing her closer and closer. It was making her still and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot afraid, making her forget her mother. But then she saw the tall man\u0027s golden eyes and they were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehungry. And all of a sudden she remembered what he wanted to do to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jerked away from the voice and dove for the tent flap again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time she got all the way outside. And she threw herself straight at the gap in the climbing structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thinking in a different way than she had ever thought before. The Rashel that had watched\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMommy fall was locked away in a little room inside her, crying. It was a new Rashel who wiggled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesperately through the gap in the padded room, a smart Rashel who knew that there was no point in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrying because there was nobody who cared anymore. Mommy couldn\u0027t save her, so she had to save\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eherself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a hand grab her ankle, hard enough almost to crush her bones. It yanked, trying to drag her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback through the gap. Rashel kicked backward with all her strength and then twisted, and her sock came\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoff and she pulled her leg into the padded room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome back! You need to come back right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was like a teacher\u0027s voice. It was hard not to listen. But Rashel was already scrambling into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe plastic tube in front of her. She went faster than she ever had before, hurting her knees, propelling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eherself with her bare foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got to the first fish-bowl window, I though, she saw a face looking in at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the tall man. He was staring at her. He I banged on the plastic as she went by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear cracked in Rashel like a belt. She scrambled I faster, and the knocks on the tube followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was underneath her now. Keeping up with I her. Rashel passed another window and looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see his hair shining in the sunlight. She could see his pale face looking up at her. And his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome down, came the voice and it wasn\u0027t stem anymore. It was sweet. Come down and we\u0027ll go get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome ice cream. What kind of ice cream do you like best? Rashel knew then that this was how he\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egotten Timmy into the tent. She didn\u0027t even pause in her scrambling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t get away from him. He was traveling with her, just under her, waiting for her to come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout or get to a place where he could reach in and grab her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher. I need to get higher, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved instinctively, as if some sixth sense was telling her which way to turn each time she had a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echoice. She went through angled tubes, straight tubes, tubes that weren\u0027t solid at all, but made of woven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecanvas strips. And finally she got to a place where she couldn\u0027t go any higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a square room with a padded floor and netting sides. She was at the front of the climbing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estructure; she could see mothers and fathers standing and sitting in little groups. She could feel the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow her, looking up, was the tall man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChocolate brownie? Mint chip? Bubble gum?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was putting pictures in her mind. Tastes. Rashel looked around frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was so much noise-every kid in the climbing structure was yelling. Who would even notice her if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe shouted? They\u0027d think she was joking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll you have to do is come down. You know you have to come down sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel looked into the pale face turned up to her. The eyes were like dark holes. Hungry. Patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was going to get her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to win. She had no way to fight him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then something tore inside Rashel and she did the only thing a five-year-old could do against an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved her hand between the rough cords that made the netting, scraping off skin. She pushed her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhole small arm through and she pointed down at the tall man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she screamed in a way she\u0027d never screamed before. Piercing shrieks that cut through the happy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enoise of the other kids. She screamed the way Ms. Bruce at preschool had taught her to do if any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estranger ever bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help meeee! Help meeee! That man tried to touch me I\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept screaming it, kept pointing. And she saw people look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they didn\u0027t do anything. They just stared. Lots of faces, looking up at her. Nobody moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way, it was even worse than anything that had happened before. They could hear her, but nobody\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas going to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she saw somebody moving. It was a big boy, not quite a grown-up man. He was wearing a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euniform like the one Rashel\u0027s father used to wear before he died. That meant he was a Marine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going toward the tall man, and his face was dark and angry. And now, as if they had only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneeded this example, other people were moving, too. Several men who looked like fathers. A woman\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith a cellular phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall man turned and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ducked under the climbing structure, heading toward the back, toward the tent where Rashel\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emother was. He moved very fast, much faster than any of the people in the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he sent words to Rashel\u0027s mind before he disappeared completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee you later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was definitely gone, Rashel slumped against the netting, feeling the rough cord bite into her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echeek. People down below were calling to her;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekids just behind her were whispering. None of it really mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could cry now; it would be okay, but she didn\u0027t seem to have any tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police were no good. There were two officers, a man and a woman. The woman believed Rashel a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle. But every time her eyes would start to believe, she\u0027d shake her head and say, \"But what was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eman really doing to Timmy? Baby-doll, sweetie, I know it\u0027s awful, but just try to remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man didn\u0027t believe even a little. Rashel would have traded them both for the Marine back at the carnival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll they\u0027d found in the tent was her mother with a broken neck. No Timmy. Rashel wasn\u0027t sure but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought the man had probably taken him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to think about why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually the police drove her to her Aunt Corinne\u0027s, who was the only family she had left now. Aunt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorinne was old and her bony hands hurt Rashel\u0027s arms when she clutched her and cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put Rashel in a bedroom full of strange smells and tried to give her medicine to make her sleep. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas like cough syrup, but it made her tongue numb. Rashel waited until Aunt Corinne was gone, then she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espat it into her hand and wiped her hand on the sheets, way down at the foot of the bed where the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblankets tucked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she put her arms around her hunched-up knees and sat staring into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too little, too helpless. That was the problem. She wasn\u0027t going to be able to do anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagainst him when he came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of course he was coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what the man was, even if the adults didn\u0027t believe her. He was a vampire, just like on TV. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emonster that drank blood. And he knew she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why he\u0027d promised to see her later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, when Aunt Corinne\u0027s house was quiet, Rashel tiptoed to the closet and slid it open. She climbed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe shoe rack and squirmed and kicked until she was on the top shelf above the clothes. It was narrow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut wide enough for her. That was one good thing about being little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to use every advantage she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her toe, she slid the closet door back shut. Then she piled sweaters and other folded things from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe shelf on top of herself, covering even her head. And finally she curled up on the hard bare wood and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime in the night she smelled smoke. She got down from the shelf-falling more than climbing-and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaw flames in her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never knew exactly how she managed to run through them and get out of the house. The whole night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas like one long blurred nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Aunt Corinne didn\u0027t get out. When the fire trucks came with their sirens and their flashing lights,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit was already too late. And even though Rashel knew that he had set the fire-the vampire-the police\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t believe her. They didn\u0027t understand why he had to kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning they took her to a foster home, which would be the first of many. The people there were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enice, but Rashel wouldn\u0027t let them hold her or comfort her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe already knew what she had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was going to survive, she had to make herself hard and strong. She couldn\u0027t care about anybody\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eelse, or trust anybody, or rely on anybody. Nobody could protect her. Not even Mommy had been able\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to protect herself. She had to learn to fight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-2.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
