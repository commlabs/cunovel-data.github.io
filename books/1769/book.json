It also saved Bride McKells\u0027s life. Before, the gorgeous vampire was a target for every fanatic with a stake and a crucifix. Now, she\u0027s free to roam the streets -- and desperate to find others of her kind. One man claims to have the answers she seeks. Devyn, King of the Targons, is a warrior and a womanizer, and he makes no secret of how much he wants Bride -- and how dangerous he could be to her in every way. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAn avid collector of women, Devyn easily seduces human and otherworlder alike. Until now. Not only does Bride resist him, but she leaves Devyn feeling something entirely new...a bone-deep need bordering on obsession. Her blood is the key to curing a vicious alien disease, but helping Bride uncover her origins will compel her to choose between electrifying passion and a destiny that could tear her from Devyn\u0027s side forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4.jpg","author":"Gena Showalter","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:31 AM"}
