{"id":110624,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eSeventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\u0027RE doing?\" she demanded. Her voice was still too loud as far as I was concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, I- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse us, Lord Ivashkov,\" she growled. Then, like I was five years old, she grabbed me by my arm and jerked me out of the room. Champagne sloshed out of my glass and splashed onto the skirt of my dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" I exclaimed, once we were out in the hall. Mournfully, I looked down at my dress. \"This is silk. You could have ruined it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed the champagne flute and set it down on a nearby table. \"Good. Maybe it\u0027ll stop you from dressing up like a cheap whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa,\" I said, shocked. \"That\u0027s kind of harsh. And where do you get off turning motherly all of a sudden?\" I gestured to the dress. \"This isn\u0027t exactly cheap. You thought it was nice of Tasha to give it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because I didn\u0027t expect you to wear it out with Moroi and make a spectacle of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not making a spectacle of myself. And anyway, it covers everything up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dress that tight might as well be showing everything,\" she retorted. She, of course, was dressed in guardian black: tailored black linen pants and a matching blazer. She had a few curves of her own, but the clothing hid them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially when you\u0027re with a group like that. Your body\u0027s...conspicuous. And flirting with Moroi doesn\u0027t really help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t flirting with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accusation made me angry because I felt I\u0027d been on really good behavior lately. I used to flirt all the time-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and do other things- with Moroi guys, but after a few talks and one embarrassing incident with Dimitri, I\u0027d realized how stupid that was. Dhampir girls did have to be careful with Moroi guys, and I kept that in mind all the time now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething petty occurred to me. \"Besides,\" I said mockingly, \"isn\u0027t that what I\u0027m supposed to do? Hook up with a Moroi and further my race? It\u0027s what you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glowered. \"Not when I was your age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were only a few years older than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do anything stupid, Rose,\" she said. \"You\u0027re too young for a baby. You don\u0027t have the life experience for it-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you haven\u0027t even lived your own life yet. You won\u0027t be able to do the kind of job you wish you could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned, mortified. \"Are we really even discussing this? How did we go from me allegedly flirting to suddenly having a litter? I\u0027m not having sex with him or anyone else, and even if I were, I know about birth control. Why are you talking to me like I\u0027m a child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you act like one.\" It was remarkably like what Dimitri had told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared. \"So you\u0027re going to send me to my room now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Rose.\" She suddenly looked tired. \"You don\u0027t have to go to your room, but don\u0027t go back in there, either. Hopefully you didn\u0027t draw too much attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make it sound like I was giving a lap dance in there,\" I told her. \"I just had dinner with Lissa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised what things can spark rumors,\" she warned. \"Especially with Adrian Ivashkov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, she turned and headed off down the hall. Watching her, I felt anger and resentment burn through me. Overreact much? I hadn\u0027t done anything wrong. I knew she had her whole blood-whore paranoia, but this was extreme, even for her. Worst of all, she\u0027d dragged me out of there, and several people had witnessed it. For someone who supposedly didn\u0027t want me attracting attention, she\u0027d kind of messed that one up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of Moroi who\u0027d been standing near Adrian and me walked out of the room. They glanced in my direction and then whispered something as they passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Mom,\" I muttered to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumiliated, I stalked off in the opposite direction, not really sure where I was going. I headed out toward the back of the lodge, away from all the activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall eventually ended, but a door leading to some stairs sat on the left. The door was unlocked, so I followed the stairs upward to another door. To my pleasure, it opened up onto a small rooftop deck that didn\u0027t appear to see much use. A blanket of snow lay over it all, but it was early morning out here, and the sun shone brightly, making everything glitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brushed snow off of a large, box-like object that looked to be part of the ventilation system. Heedless of my dress, I sat down on it. Wrapping my arms around myself, I stared off, taking in the view and the sun I rarely got to enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was startled when the door opened a few minutes later. When I looked back I was even more startled still to see Dimitri emerge. My heart gave a small flutter, and I turned away, unsure what to think. His boots crunched in the snow as he walked over to where I was sitting. A moment later, he took off his long coat and draped it over my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down beside me. \"You must be freezing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was, but I didn\u0027t want to admit it. \"The sun\u0027s out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped his head back, looking up at the perfect blue sky. I knew he missed the sun as much as I did sometimes. \"It is. But we\u0027re still on a mountain in the middle of winter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. We sat there in a comfortable silence for a while. Occasionally, a light wind blew clouds of snow around. It was night for Moroi, and most would be going to bed soon, so the ski runs were quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life is a disaster,\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a disaster,\" he said automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you follow me from the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t even know you were there.\" His dark clothes indicated he must have been on guardian duty at the party. \"So you saw the illustrious Janine cause a commotion by dragging me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a commotion. Hardly anyone noticed. I saw because I was watching you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refused to let myself get excited over that. \"That\u0027s not what she said,\" I told him. \"I might as well have been working a corner as far as she was concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relayed the conversation from the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s just worried about you,\" Dimitri said when I finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She overreacted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes mothers are overprotective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. \"Yeah, but this is my mother. And she didn\u0027t seem that protective, really. I think she was more worried I\u0027d embarrass her or something. And all that becoming-a-mother-too-young stuff was stupid. I\u0027m not going to do anything like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she wasn\u0027t talking about you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence. My jaw fell open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t have the life experience for it- you haven\u0027t even lived your own life yet. You won\u0027t be able to do the kind of job you wish you could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom had been twenty when I was born. Growing up, that had always seemed really old to me. But now...that was only a few years off for me. Not old at all. Did she think she\u0027d had me too soon? Had she done a shoddy job raising me simply because she didn\u0027t know any better at the time? Did she regret the way things had turned out between us? And was it... was it maybe possible that she\u0027d had some personal experience of her own with Moroi men and people spreading rumors about her? I had inherited a lot of her features. I mean, I\u0027d even noticed tonight what a nice figure she had. She had a pretty face, too- for a nearly forty-year-old, I mean. She\u0027d probably been really, really good-looking when she was younger....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. I didn\u0027t want to think about that. If I did, I might have to reevaluate my relationship with her- maybe even acknowledge my mother as a real person- and I already had too many relationships stressing me. Lissa always worried me, even though she seemed to be okay for a change. My so-called romance with Mason was in shambles. And then, of course, there was Dimitri....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We aren\u0027t fighting right now.\" I blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a sidelong look. \"Do you want to fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I hate fighting with you. Verbally, I mean. I don\u0027t mind in the gym.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I detected the hint of a smile. Always a half-smile for me. Rarely a full one. \"I don\u0027t like fighting with you either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting next to him there, I marveled at the warm and happy emotions springing up inside of me. There was something about being around him that felt so good, that moved me in a way Mason couldn\u0027t. You can\u0027t force love, I realized. It\u0027s there or it isn\u0027t. If it\u0027s not there, you\u0027ve got to be able to admit it. If it is there, you\u0027ve got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next words that came out of my mouth astonished me, both because they were completely unselfish and because I actually meant them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tasha\u0027s offer. You should take her up on it. It\u0027s a really great chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered my mom\u0027s words about being ready for children. I wasn\u0027t. Maybe she hadn\u0027t been. But Tasha was. And I knew Dimitri was too. They got along really well. He could go be her guardian, have some kids with her ... it would be a good deal for both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never expected to hear you say anything like that,\" he told me, voice tight. \"Especially after- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a bitch I\u0027ve been? Yeah.\" I tugged his coat tighter against the cold. It smelled like him. It was intoxicating, and I could half-imagine being wrapped in his embrace. Adrian might have been onto something about the power of scent. \"Well. Like I said, I don\u0027t want to fight anymore. I don\u0027t want us to hate each other. And...well ...\" I squeezed my eyes shut and then opened them. \"No matter how I feel about us ... I want you to be happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence yet again. I noticed then that my chest hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri reached out and put his arm around me. He pulled me to him, and I rested my head on his chest. \"Roza,\" was all he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time he\u0027d really touched me since the night of the lust charm. The practice room had been something different ... more animal. This wasn\u0027t even about sex. It was just about being close to someone you cared about, about the emotion that kind of connection flooded you with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri might run off with Tasha, but I would still love him. I would probably always love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cared about Mason. But I would probably never love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed into Dimitri, just wishing I could stay like that forever. It felt right being with him. And- no matter how much the thought of him and Tasha made me ache- doing what was best for him felt right. Now, I knew, it was time to stop being a coward and do something else that was right. Mason had said I needed to learn something about myself. I just had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, I pulled away and handed Dimitri his coat. I stood up. He regarded me curiously, sensing my unease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you going?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To break someone\u0027s heart,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admired Dimitri for a heartbeat more- the dark, knowing eyes and silken hair. Then I headed inside. I had to apologize to Mason...and tell him there\u0027d never be anything between us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-18.html","bookId":2061,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM"}
