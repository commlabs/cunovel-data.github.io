THE SUBLIME ONES.","content":"Calm is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hideth droll monsters!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and laughters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A sublime one saw I to-day, a solemn one, a penitent of the spirit: Oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With upraised breast, and like those who draw in their breath: thus did he stand, the sublime one, and in silence:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and rich in torn raiment; many thorns also hung on him—but I saw no rose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did this hunter return from the forest of knowledge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even yet a wild beast gazeth out of his seriousness—an unconquered wild beast!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As a tiger doth he ever stand, on the point of springing; but I do not like those strained souls; ungracious is my taste towards all those self-engrossed ones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And ye tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about taste and tasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and tasting!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and weigher; and alas for every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and scales and weigher!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Should he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime one, then only will his beauty begin—and then only will I taste him and find him savoury.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And only when he turneth away from himself will he o’erleap his own shadow—and verily! into HIS sun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Far too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the penitent of the spirit became pale; he almost starved on his expectations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Contempt is still in his eye, and loathing hideth in his mouth. To be sure, he now resteth, but he hath not yet taken rest in the sunshine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of the earth, and not of contempt for the earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and lowing, walketh before the plough-share: and his lowing should also laud all that is earthly!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dark is still his countenance; the shadow of his hand danceth upon it. O’ershadowed is still the sense of his eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His deed itself is still the shadow upon him: his doing obscureth the doer. Not yet hath he overcome his deed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To be sure, I love in him the shoulders of the ox: but now do I want to see also the eye of the angel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also his hero-will hath he still to unlearn: an exalted one shall he be, and not only a sublime one:—the ether itself should raise him, the will-less one!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He hath subdued monsters, he hath solved enigmas. But he should also redeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly children should he transform them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without jealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, but in beauty! Gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of the magnanimous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His arm across his head: thus should the hero repose; thus should he also surmount his repose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But precisely to the hero is BEAUTY the hardest thing of all. Unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A little more, a little less: precisely this is much here, it is the most here.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: that is the hardest for all of you, ye sublime ones!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When power becometh gracious and descendeth into the visible—I call such condescension, beauty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And from no one do I want beauty so much as from thee, thou powerful one: let thy goodness be thy last self-conquest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All evil do I accredit to thee: therefore do I desire of thee the good.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings, who think themselves good because they have crippled paws!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after: more beautiful doth it ever become, and more graceful—but internally harder and more sustaining—the higher it riseth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yea, thou sublime one, one day shalt thou also be beautiful, and hold up the mirror to thine own beauty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then will thy soul thrill with divine desires; and there will be adoration even in thy vanity!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For this is the secret of the soul: when the hero hath abandoned it, then only approacheth it in dreams—the superhero.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61050.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
