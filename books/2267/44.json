I don’t have any plans to off my kin so that I’m the only Stone left to inherit the place. I’m not sure I’d want Melody House. The place can be a damned headache. The upkeep is exorbitant. But don’t worry about me. I have a few college degrees of my own—I taught for a few years, did you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. What did you teach?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“English. Hey, don’t look now, but the sheriff has been watching us suspiciously. Want to make him jealous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Darcy said, smiling as she shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad,” he said, but lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well…what shall we do now? Want to order some food? I’m ravenous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And there’s an empty table over there. Let me see if I can gather the forces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed for the table Clint had indicated, gathering their group as they did so. Adam had been deep in conversation with Matt, but the two of them joined them. Whatever his anger had been earlier, Matt displayed none of it at the Wayside Inn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did he come particularly near Darcy. When the conversation at the table started to veer toward the haunting at Melody House, Matt stepped in to ask Carter about some of his properties, and Adam kept the ball rolling, wanting to know more about the general area. The meal passed pleasantly, and when it was over, yawns around the table indicated that it was time to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy drove back with Adam, Penny, and Carter. They reached the house first. Darcy went straight up to the Lee Room. Adam went with her, taking the video and audio tapes that had been running from the recorders, and resetting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are all right in here?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can stay in the chair, if you want,” Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam, if I don’t let these dreams come, I’ll never see it out to the end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “But you’re sure you’re all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! Get out, Adam. Go to bed,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her cheek, and left her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy had just started to doze when she thought she heard movement on the balcony. She lay in bed for several seconds, listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, she got up and went to the French doors, but didn’t open them. She paused, and listened. Sound…movement. She moved the draperies, her heart seeming to pound in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was someone on the balcony. Matt. He was at the rail near the door to his own bedroom suite, looking out at the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, wishing she could go out. There was no reason to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainfully, she turned, and went back to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman in white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Darcy saw her, standing at the foot of the bed. She was in a haze; Darcy saw no details in her face, no colors, just the woman, in sheer white, standing at the foot of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, she faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the dream came. Somewhere inside herself, Darcy knew that the woman was growing more desperate, determined that Darcy understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy slipped into the entity. Into the woman. And into the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it out of the bedroom, and to the landing. And it was there that he caught her, falling upon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled briefly, aware of his heat and strength as he grappled her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been so different. But now, she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she fought fiercely, struggled, desperate, aware that her life was at stake. The very urgency gave her a burst of power she might have never known that she possessed. She scratched, swore, kicked, punched, and fought to gouge out his eyes. She caught him with such a blow against the jaw that he went immobile, and she took full advantage, shoving wildly against his body, casting him off. She crawled to free herself from the sprawled weight of his limbs. She staggered up herself, and made the first step, but his fingers entwined around the hem of her gown, dragging her back down. She fell atop him, the breath knocked from her, and for a moment, they both lay panting. The pain in her temple dazed her; she realized she had hit her head on the second step. At her side, while she remained paralyzed, he rose up to a half-seated position beside her. And again, their eyes met. Something within his softened suddenly. He reached out a hand. She flinched, but his fingers felt as gentle as raindrops against her cheeks. “I did love you so much,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched him in return. He came to his feet, reaching for her hands, drawing her up and against him, and it might have been as many another night, when they had melded together, when passion had reigned every thought, when she could not bear to keep her hands off him, or he her. The room continued to spin, the pain in her temple was deep…but it seemed that he was whispering now, the words that could so arouse…and his hands, they were on her, his lips…nuzzled those whispers against her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a fight, surely, nothing more. His eyes could not have been so deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whisper came again, against her lips, throat, her earlobes, her mouth, hard then, crushing against her. And she was falling…into his arms. She was aware of the sound of his footsteps against the hard wood floor, aware of his movement as he bore her weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey returned to the bedroom, and he set down upon the bed, tenderly. She closed her eyes, thinking that the affair was too passionate, ruled by the senses, nothing more, and yes, so totally wrong. But he moved away, and she knew. Knew that he had left her only to shed his clothing so that he could return, and flesh could burn against flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moonlight pouring into the room, but no touch of his warmth, no vibrance and heat as he crawled atop her for he did not do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dog howled, a cry to heaven, to the night, mournful, pathetic, prophetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps a storm was coming, and there would be thunder outside, like the rage of desire that was all that had ever really been between them. But a storm could mean a tempest, and that would be fine, for she still felt the adrenaline racing in her veins, but what she had seen before could not be, for he had loved her, loved her more than she had loved him, wanted her first without thought of consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blew…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his silence continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA howl sounded again, eerie in the night. A rage of wind? The baying of the hound. She didn’t know. She merely felt her heated flesh began to chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came up on her elbows, searching for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood still at the secretary. He had not moved, not cast off his clothing in fevered abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was reading, reading what she had written. He stood dead still, his eyes riveted on the paper, and the words that she had written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned to her, slowly. She saw the tension build in his hand, and rock through his arms and chest. She felt his gaze fall upon her with fury, greater than that she had ever seen before, even when he had first come that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear, like icicles, ripped into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror curled around her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes, oh, God, his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wasted no time,” he said aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to escape. But perhaps, her only chance lay in playing a game. Pretending that she didn’t see the death in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was angry. You meant to leave me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked slowly to the side of the bed. “A woman scorned,” he said lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would never know what the outcome might have been if she hadn’t sat down to write that evening. Perhaps, no different. She had seen her own destruction in his eyes when he had first come;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis look was only a compound of that, and when they had struggled in the hallway, it had been a reprieve and nothing more. She had seen him when he had first arrived, seen the way he had looked up at her from the first-floor landing, far below, staring up the stairway, to see her at the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A woman scorned,” he repeated. “Is deadly. Deadly, deadly…dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t scream. She didn’t bother. She cursed him as he came toward her then. Cursed him, and the house, for all eternity. Her hatred was deep. She was about to be silenced. No one would ever know the truth about him, what had really happened. The truth would die with her, and in time, she would be…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing more than legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to spring to her feet once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t make it. He fell upon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands…those hands which had brushed against her with the greatest tenderness and ardor…now closed around her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTightened, and tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strangled out curses. Swearing. With the darkening of the light that was her life, she still swore that he would pay, that come hell and damnation, somehow, sometime, through all the powers of existence, dark and light, she would come back, she would find her revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoking, gasping, lips turned blue, breath fading, blackness before her eyes…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll pay,” she swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But no one knows that you’re here,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vise constricted, thumb pressing into her throat. Black pinpoints joined together. Her lungs were bursting. She longed desperately to keep fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut light was fading…fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy woke, drenched with sweat, gasping for air. She sat up. A late-night show was still playing on the television. A coolness hummed throughout the room, soothing to her flesh, for she had been so hot, tossing and turning, twisting the bedclothes into piles of knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had come to the end. She had seen the spirit die in the flesh. And yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d seen nothing clearly. No detail of face or form. She had felt the hands around her neck, but she hadn’t seen the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smoothed back her hair, and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was there again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman in white. Standing at the foot of Darcy’s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, she turned and started for the door. Darcy slipped from the bed. The woman turned back in her unearthly haze of white and beckoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door to the hallway and beckoned again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/haunted-harrison-investigation-1/page-44.html","bookId":2267,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:12 PM"}
