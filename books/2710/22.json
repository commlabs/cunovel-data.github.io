But at least she wouldn\u0027t be trying to face things all by herself. There\u0027s just so much a doctor can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rotated his coffee cup gently in his hand, watching the cream blend slowly into the coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natalie, do you remember the time that infant was brought in here, the one that had died during its nap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie nodded. \"I\u0027ll never forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was a student, and then when I was just beginning in practice,\" her father said slowly, \"the death of a child was the one thing I couldn\u0027t get used to. It seemed so cruel, so unnecessary, such a waste. For a while I thought I would become a pediatrician, just so that I could do my best to prevent such things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t. Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her and chuckled. \"To be perfectly honest, I found that I hated dealing with chicken pox and diaper rash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\" He sipped his coffee. \"More than that. I began to be aware that when something devastating strikes a young person, a child, it is almost always mitigated by the fact that there is a family. People who care, who comfort, who grieve. That doesn\u0027t make illness, or pain—or death—any less cruel or frustrating, but it makes those things bearable. Like that baby. It was a tragic thing for those parents—who, incidentally, Nat, had another baby this past spring—but still, that infant, when he died, was in a warm and happy home. His life, short though it was, was filled with love. Do 1 sound sentimental?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She smiled. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Armstrong frowned. \"But it\u0027s the old people, the ones who have no one, who touch me now. I do what I can for them medically, and sometimes it isn\u0027t much. But more than that, I listen to them, care about them. I even sent Florence Pittman some flowers on her last birthday. She was eighty-seven.\" He looked a little sheepish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, I love you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, Natalie. But thank you for saying it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad. You know that I\u0027ve spent the whole summer—well, looking for things, figuring things out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t ever asked what I\u0027ve found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natalie, your mother and I knew that if you wanted to tell us, you would. It\u0027s not a decision we can make for you. If you don\u0027t ever want to tell us, we\u0027ll understand. We\u0027ll accept that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I want to tell you all of it. But there\u0027s this one thing. I found a man, an old man. He was very sick when I saw him last month, and I\u0027m not even sure if he\u0027s still alive. He has cancer. And he was just like you were saying, all alone. He had no family left, and he was in a hospital, dying, with a few plants and flowers friends had sent. And the green hospital walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father looked at his empty cup. \"I know,\" he said. \"I mean I know what\u0027s it\u0027s like. I\u0027ve seen it again and again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Dad,\" said Natalie slowly. \"I didn\u0027t know it then, but now I\u0027ve found out that he\u0027s my grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I have to go back. Just one more trip, to see him. I\u0027m a little afraid to; I\u0027m afraid that he\u0027ll be gone, that I\u0027ll go back only to put flowers on a grave. But I have to do at least that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natalie, if you\u0027d like me to, I\u0027ll find out for you. If you call the hospital, they\u0027ll only give you the official information: his condition is poor, or satisfactory. But if I call, as a doctor, I can find out what\u0027s really going on. Do you want to tell me his name and the name of the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrote it for him. Clarence Therrian, Simmons\u0027 Mills Community Hospital, and he looked at the piece of paper and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember Simmons\u0027 Mills,\" he said. \"We drove there, your mother and I, and you were waiting, wrapped in a yellow blanket, sound asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Armstrong,\" said his nurse crisply from the door to the lab, \"there are patients waiting in every examining room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie and her father grinned at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Dad,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the long, busy day, Natalie was tidying up the waiting room before she went home. Dr. Armstrong finished making notes in a patient\u0027s folder, closed it, and said, \"Natalie, tell your mother that I\u0027ll be late for dinner. I have to check on a patient in the hospital before I come home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" said Natalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m giving you the next two days off, Nat. I made that phone call. Clarence Therrian is still alive. But I think you\u0027d better go tomorrow. Don\u0027t wait for the weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was saddened. She knew he was dying, had even expected that he might be dead. But suddenly she was more saddened by it than she had been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he know, Natalie? That you\u0027re his granddaughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to leave, stopped, came back, and put his arms around her for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natalie,\" he said, sitting down on one of the waiting room chairs, \"I have an apology to make to you. At the beginning of the summer, when you set off to make this search, I was disturbed by it. Hurt. So was your mother. You knew that, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we were wrong, I think. I can\u0027t speak for Mom, but I suspect you\u0027ll find she\u0027s come to realize the same thing I have. That it was the right thing for you to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" said Natalie, puzzled, \"I\u0027m not even sure of that myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent. \"It\u0027s a fine line,\" he said finally, \"and I\u0027ve been thinking about it a lot—the line between the past and the present. And it\u0027s a line we have to feel our way along, so that we know what the connection is. For you, the connections were twisted and blurred. It was the right thing, to sort them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" said Natalie suddenly. \"Do you remember the game we used to play at our birthday parties, when we were little? We called it Spiderweb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and laughed, remembering. \"Sure. Your mother and I spent hours, running threads all around the house, over furniture, behind and under things, and at the end of each thread there was a prize for each child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How I loved that. Scrambling around, following that thread. It seemed as if there would be something miraculous at the end of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"A pack of gum. Or a comic book. I don\u0027t remember the prizes as much as I remember the excitement of looking for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this summer seem like a Spiderweb?\" her father asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little, maybe. The challenge of looking. The fear that the thread might break. Expecting the miracle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And finding it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie shrugged. \"Finding the ordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very often, you know,\" her father told her, \"after those birthday parties, your mother and I would end up throwing away the packs of gum, the comic books. The kids would forget to take them home. As you said, the prizes weren\u0027t as exciting as the searching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did find my mother—my natural mother, Dad,\" Natalie said suddenly. \"I won\u0027t forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you won\u0027t. How will you fit it into your life, Natalie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have, I guess. I said hello to her, and I said goodbye to her. I won\u0027t forget her. But she\u0027s not part of my life anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Armstrong lit his pipe, and the thin blue streak of smoke lifted itself toward the ceiling of the waiting room. \"Natalie, you\u0027ve done a very healthy thing. People like Florence Pittman don\u0027t ever say goodbye to the past. Saying goodbye is the hardest part, and some people never learn how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loved her husband so much, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And your mother and I love you. But we\u0027ll have to say goodbye to you, in a way, when you go off to college. You have to let go when the time comes. If you don\u0027t, you live with ghosts, the way Florence Pittman does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Tallie,\" said Natalie suddenly, stabbed with a sharp pain of disloyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father chewed on the stem of his pipe, and nodded. \"And Tallie. She still lives surrounded by memories of Stefan. But Tallie\u0027s ghosts are happy ones, Nat. Not the confused and painful ones that make Florence Pittman\u0027s life difficult. And not the same kinds as yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a strange summer, Dad. And now there\u0027s just Dr. Therrian. There are others, I guess, but he\u0027s the one I want to make the connection to, the one I want to say goodbye to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it because he has no one else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partly that, I guess,\" she said. She thought for a moment. \"But mostly—I didn\u0027t realize this till now, Dad—mostly it\u0027s because he loved me so much that he said goodbye, and let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNANCY WENT with Natalie to Simmons\u0027 Mills. It was Natalie\u0027s idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the heck,\" said Nancy when her sister suggested it. \"Steve\u0027s mad at me, as usual. I\u0027m sick of babysitting for the Kimballs every minute. That kid of theirs always wants twelve bedtime stories and fourteen glasses of water, and then when he wets the bed, guess who has to change the sheets. Sure, I\u0027d love to take a couple days off from my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip seemed shorter with company in the car. Nancy chattered endlessly about everything, about nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have said yes, Nat, when she asked you if you wanted to be a model. Wow. Think of all the money. Think of all the men, lusting after your face on the cover of Vogue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie grimaced. \"Look there to the left, Nance, at the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy glanced at the jagged, desolate peaks against the thin haze of the August sky. \"Wow,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about your vocabulary.\" Natalie laughed. \"Do you think you could come up with a better expletive than \u0027Wow\u0027 occasionally? Maybe Horrible Aunt Helen will give you a thesaurus for Christmas and you could investigate some other possibilities of language?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy giggled. They rounded a sharp curve in the road and the mountains disappeared behind a thick barrier of spruce trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I wasn\u0027t kidding, Nat. You could make a fortune, being a model. I\u0027ll be back in Branford, being a nursery school teacher or something, probably married to Steve and having kids that wet the bed every night, and I could pick up glamorous magazines and say, \u0027That\u0027s my sister on the cover.\u0027 I\u0027d tell my kids, \u0027Look at Aunt Natalie, there in the centerfold of Playboy. Isn\u0027t she gorgeous? She\u0027s the one who sends you those expensive toys from New York every Christmas.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me, Nance. You can say, \u0027Look there, kids, on the cover of Time. That\u0027s your brilliant Aunt Natalie with the thick glasses. She\u0027s just discovered a cure for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and they\u0027ve awarded her the annual Lady Doctor prize. She\u0027s the one who sends you all those yucky vitamin pills at Christmas.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy groaned. \"You have no sense of adventure, Natalie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, that\u0027s adventurous, being a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have Paul Newman on your doorstep. Robert Redford. Elton John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I will anyway. They can come when they have hernias to be repaired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gross. Well, maybe you can write a book and make your fortune that way. Probing the Innards of the World\u0027s Most Gorgeous Men. That would really sell, Nat. What is Redford\u0027s appendix really like? Buy this book for $12.95 and find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scars of the Stars, Ell call it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Reader\u0027s Digest will present the condensed version.
