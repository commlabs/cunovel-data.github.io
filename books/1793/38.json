She seemed cheerful, even a bit enthusiastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dressed in a dark, lightweight suit with a little scarf at her throat. Her honey-colored hair was brushed sleekly back into a neat knot at the back of her neck. Very formal for Eclipse Bay, Octavia thought. But then, she had come here to apply for a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s strictly a temporary position, I\u0027m afraid,\" Octavia said. \"I\u0027m planning to sell the gallery at the end of the summer and there\u0027s no way to know if whoever buys it will want an assistant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street at the end of the block she could see Nick leaning against the side of his car, talking to Sandy Hickson at the town\u0027s only gas station. Just the sight of him, even from this distance, did things to her pulse. There was something deliciously compelling about the way the man lounged, she thought; a sexy, subtle, masculine grace that made her think extremely erotic thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvidently the conversation with Sandy was a riveting one. She wondered if Nick was actively pursuing his investigation or just passing the time of day while Sandy put gas in the tank and washed the windshield. It was impossible to tell from this distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that you can\u0027t promise anything beyond the summer,\" Gail said quickly. \"But this will buy me some breathing space to look around and try to line up something permanent up at Chamberlain or the institute. I really appreciate this, Octavia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as much as I appreciate your agreeing to take the position,\" Octavia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure a few more questions will come up, but I think I\u0027ve got the basics down. As I told you, I\u0027ve had some experience in retail and I\u0027ve always loved art. In a way, this is a perfect job for me. I\u0027m going to enjoy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might as well start this afternoon. If you\u0027re free, that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Mom is looking after Anne. I\u0027ll give her a call and tell her that I\u0027ve started working. She\u0027ll be very relieved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ve got a lot of things to do in the next few weeks. I\u0027m planning to move, you know. And then there\u0027s the Children\u0027s Art Show. Also, I have to get started on making arrangements to sell both branches of Bright Visions.\" The list of objectives had become her mantra, she realized. She ran through it in her mind whenever she felt dispirited or depressed about her life at the end of the summer. It kept her focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail hesitated. \"I know it\u0027s none of my business, but do you mind if I ask why you feel you have to sell your galleries and leave the state?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been sort of drifting for a while,\" Octavia said. \"Trying to decide what I want to do with my future. I don\u0027t have all the answers yet, but I\u0027ve definitely come to the conclusion that I need to move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail nodded sympathetically. \"Believe it or not, I know exactly what you mean. I felt that drifting sensation for a while after my divorce. It was hard to make decisions. But having Anne to support emotionally and financially did a lot to make me pull up my socks and move forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet it did.\" She watched Nick across the street and thought that, whatever else you could say about him, there was no denying that he was an excellent father. \"Nothing like being responsible for a child to help you put your priorities in order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. Kids come first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ wonder if I\u0027ll ever have one of my own, Octavia thought. A picture of Carson\u0027s laughing face danced through her mind. She pushed it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a question for you,\" she said to Gail. \"Why did you come back to Eclipse Bay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anne has reached the age where she\u0027s starting to ask why her daddy doesn\u0027t come see her,\" Gail said. \"I thought it would be good for her to spend more time with my father. The positive male role model thing, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Octavia said softly. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown at the station, Nick had straightened away from his car, preparing to leave. Anticipation crackled through her. She wondered if he was getting ready to drive here to the gallery to give her an update on his progress. Maybe she would suggest that they talk over lunch. Yes, that sounded good. A business lunch. She could leave her new assistant in charge of the gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nick did not get behind the wheel of his car. As she watched, he started purposefully across the street, heading toward the entrance to the Total Eclipse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What on earth?\" She stepped outside onto the sidewalk to get a better look. \"Good grief, he\u0027s going into that dive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Gail came through the opening behind her. She glanced down the street with a puzzled expression. \"Nick Harte?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s almost lunchtime. Maybe he decided to pick up a sandwich there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the Total Eclipse?\" Gail wrinkled her nose. \"Good way to get food poisoning, if you ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\" Intuition kicked in. \"I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s following a lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail glanced at her with open curiosity. \"It\u0027s true, then? Nick Harte is playing private eye for you and A.Z. and the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not playing private eye. He\u0027s making serious inquiries into the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. I don\u0027t know how many serious folks he\u0027s going to find inside the Total Eclipse, especially at this time of day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good point.\" She\u0027d been in town long enough to have learned something about the clientele of the Total Eclipse. \"You know, I don\u0027t like the looks of this. Who do you suppose he\u0027s going to talk to inside that joint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s Fred, the owner,\" Gail said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She relaxed a little. \"He tends the bar. Bartenders always pick up useful tidbits of gossip. The hero in Nick\u0027s books often consults them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if memory serves,\" Gail continued dryly, \"you can usually count on finding Mean Eugene and his sidekick Dickhead Dwayne in there most days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who you mean. I\u0027ve seen them on the street and in Fulton\u0027s occasionally. They\u0027re always together. I\u0027ve heard the Mean Eugene name but I hadn\u0027t realized the skinny one was called Dickhead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwayne and Eugene have been buddies for as long as anyone can remember. They tend to reinforce each other\u0027s worst characteristics. Eugene calls the shots and Dwayne goes along. It is generally felt in these parts that anyone who would do whatever Eugene told him to do would have to be a dickhead. Hence the name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see the logic.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-38.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
