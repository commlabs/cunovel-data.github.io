The collective madness has made itself known beyond the town borders and has given Hawkins Hollow the reputation of a village possessed. This modern-day legend draws reporter and author Quinn Black to Hawkins Hollow with the hope of making the eerie happening the subject of her new book. It is only February, but Caleb Hawkins, descendent of the town founders, has already seen and felt the stirrings of evil. Though he can never forget the beginning of the terror in the woods twenty-one years ago, the signs have never been this strong before. Cal will need the help of his best friends, Fox and Gage, but surprisingly he must rely on Quinn as well. She too, can see the evil that the locals cannot, somehow connecting her to the town--and to Cal. As winter turns to spring, Cal and Quinn will shed their inhibitions, surrendering to a growing desire. They will form the cornerstone of a group of men and women bound by fate, passion, and the fight against what is to come from out of the darkness...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:03 PM"}
