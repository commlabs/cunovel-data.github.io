But Joyce shrugged and said, \"His specialty is astral projection, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet your mind do the walking, Kait thought. It was Lewis\u0027s phrase. So Mac was responsible for the astral projections and psychic attacks against them on the way to Canada. \"But we saw at least four figures,\" she blurted before she thought. \"And one of them was Bri-I recognized her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce was setting the clock radio by the bedside and answered impatiently and almost absently. \"Mac used to guide them, help them get away and then help them get back into their bodies. But anybody can do astral projection if they have the power of the crys-\" She broke off so quickly her little white teeth actually snapped shut. Then she said, \"Bed, Kaitlyn. It\u0027s way past time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew they used the crystal to project themselves, Kait thought. I saw it beside their astral forms. But she didn\u0027t tell Joyce. She said, \"Okay, but are you going to tell me what Bri does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m going to go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all Kaitlyn could get out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, Kaitlyn could hear the voices in Gabriel\u0027s room. Gabriel and Frost and Renny? Gabriel and Frost? There was no way to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad I can\u0027t do astral projection,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia was asleep, of course, so there was no chance to talk to her. And no way to try out the secret panel downstairs-it was directly across from Joyce\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing to do, then, but go to sleep ... but it took her a long time to relax, and when she did, she had nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning she saw Frost coming out of Gabriel\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel came out a moment later, while Kaitlyn was still standing motionless by the stairs. He was shrugging into his T-shirt. He looked particularly handsome in a just-roused, early morning way. His hair was very wavy, as if someone had run fingers through it to release the curl, his eyes were hooded and lazy and there was a faint smile of satisfaction on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn discovered that she wanted to kill him. The image that came to her mind was of hitting him with a rolling pin, but not in an amusing, comic-book sort of way. In a way that would make splinters of bone fly and splatter the walls with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression changed very slightly when he saw her standing there. His eyes narrowed and his mouth soured. But he held her gaze stonily and walked by her without speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today you\u0027ll do some testing,\" Joyce said to Kaitlyn after breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before starting with Kait, Joyce settled the other psychics in. Testing had changed since the old days, Kaitlyn thought. Then, Joyce\u0027s experiments had been scientific, the kind of thing you could report in a journal article. Now, everything seemed oriented toward crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackal Mac, wearing swim trunks full of holes, was led toward the back lab with the isolation tank, and Kait heard Joyce saying, \"Just take a look inside that safe in the city, see if the papers are there. Then try the long-distance job, check out that furnace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstral projection for felons, Kait thought. Is that how they knew the twenty million was in that filing cabinet? But how did they know to look in a filing cabinet in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenny was practicing his PK, but not on a random event generator as Lewis had done. He had a collection of locks in front of him, as well as diagrams that looked like the insides of locks. Without touching anything, he was making the locks open and close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAha, Kait thought. Well, that makes sense. He needs to know what part of the lock to push with his mind to open it. PK doesn\u0027t give you magical knowledge about locks, just the power to poke around inside them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt explained Gabriel\u0027s comment about Lewis not being able to open the combination lock on the crystal-wherever the crystal was. Kaitlyn would bet her last dime that Mr. Z had some sort of fiendishly complicated locking device, something that Lewis couldn\u0027t get a diagram for. Which meant the only way to open the lock would be to somehow figure out the eight numbers in the combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa, girl. Take it easy. You\u0027ve got to find that crystal first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she\u0027d thought it, Kaitlyn shifted nervously. Gabriel and Frost were sitting across the room by the stereo. But he was studying a pile of CDs and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe couldn\u0027t tell anything unless she touched a person. Besides, she seemed to be studying Gabriel. She was looking more sleazy than grungy today, in an orange top cut so low that you could ski down the bare skin in front. Her hair had returned to its usual uncombed state and her lips were vivid tangerine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Kait asked Bri, as a diversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBri glanced up. \"Can\u0027t you tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was holding a plumb bob on its line above a map. The plumb bob and line looked just like what Kaitlyn\u0027s father had used to determine if a surface was vertical, just a small weight hanging freely from a cord. The map was upside down to Kaitlyn and she could only make out \"-Charlotte Islands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m dowsing,\" Bri said. She gave a boyish grin at Kait\u0027s surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you used a forked stick for dowsing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, stupid. That\u0027s for dowsing for water or gold or something. This kind is to find things that are far away, and you can do it for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" As Kaitlyn watched, the plumb bob began to swing in circles over a section of the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? All you got to do is think of what you\u0027re looking for. Sasha used to do the other kind of dowsing, only he didn\u0027t use a stick. He used coat hangers shaped like Is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sasha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. You never met him.\" Bri snorted laughter. \"He was blond and pretty cute, critty pute. Cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he one of Mr. Z\u0027s first students?\" Kaitlyn asked quickly. \"Part of the pilot study, like you?\" Bri seemed to be on the verge of one of those bizarre attacks which always ended in her repeating nonsense words until it drove everyone crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, him and Parte King. Not his real name. Parte King was a bike messenger in the city, a real skinny guy. Both terrific psychics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what happened to them? Are they dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? They-\" Suddenly Bri\u0027s face turned cold, as if someone had turned off a light switch inside her. She looked up at Kait and her face was hard. \"Yeah, they\u0027re dead,\" she said. \"Sasha and Parte King. You wanna make something of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce was coming out of the back lab. Kaitlyn moved away from Bri\u0027s carrel feeling depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark psychics were nicer to her now, sure, but it was like a geyser pool bubbling between eruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady to go off in her face at any minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the volunteers-would you get them, Gabriel?\" Joyce said bustling around with her clipboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frost, I\u0027m going to have you do some psychometry with them; Kait, I\u0027m going to start you with some remote viewing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat Kaitlyn in a carrel with a photograph in front of her. It was an eight-by-ten glossy of a wall safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to concentrate on the picture and draw anything that comes into your mind,\" she said. \"Try to imagine what might be in the safe, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Kaitlyn said, concealing a surge of rebellion. This was not legitimate research, and she was losing her taste for larceny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to put this on your forehead,\" Joyce added, producing a piece of masking tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the surge was one of alarm, and Kait couldn\u0027t hide it. \"An electrode over my third eye?\" she asked as lightly as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what it is. Since you haven\u0027t been exposed to the big crystal, we\u0027ll use this to enhance your powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why don\u0027t you expose me to the big crystal, then?\" Kait asked recklessly. \"Those little chips give me a headache, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, that\u0027s up to Mr. Zetes, and he doesn\u0027t want you anywhere near it. Now, hold still.\" Joyce\u0027s tone said she\u0027d had enough. Her eyes had gone as hard as gems and she barely pushed aside Kaitlyn\u0027s bangs before slapping the tape on Kait\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait felt the piece of crystal cold against her skin. It was bigger than the piece Joyce had used in the old days, maybe because now Joyce wasn\u0027t trying to conceal it. This one felt the size of a quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing where it came from, she could scarcely keep herself from tearing the tape off. But then she saw Gabriel in the doorway, looking sardonic and amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t have anything against the crystal, do you? After all, you\u0027re one of us. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn shot back, I\u0027m not one of them. But I guess you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight, angel. I\u0027m one of them-and don\u0027t you forget it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn left the tape alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t want to help Joyce with the safe. She stared at the photograph, then shut her eyes and just scribbled, taking the time to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood now how the dark psychics had attacked them on the road to Canada. First Bri probably dowsed to figure out where they were. Then Jackal Mac guided their astral forms to the right location. After that, they could assault their victims with weird apparitions or with Renny\u0027s long-distance PK. Simple. You could terrorize people without ever going near them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Joyce was expecting her to join in the long-distance crime wave, to help them visualize some safe to break into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she could see into a safe, why not a room? Why not try to visualize the secret room below the stairway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout opening her eyes, Kait groped for a new piece of paper. She\u0027d never tried to visualize a specific place before, but the remote viewing process was old hat by now. Stretch out and let your thoughts drift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlock out any external noises. Let the darkness take you down. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, think of the secret room. Think of walking up to the door, visualize that hallway lit by fluorescent greenish light. Walk up to the door . . . and let the darkness take you. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand began to cramp and itch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was dancing and skidding over the paper, moving of its own accord while Kaitlyn floated in darkness. Sketching fluidly, easily. Kaitlyn held her breath and tried not to be anxious, tried not to think or feel anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, slowing down-is it done yet? Can I look?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t resist the temptation. One eye opened, then both were open and wide. Chills swept over her, as she stared, not at the piece of paper her hand was still working on, but at the first one, the one that was supposed to be only scribbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, what is it? What have I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t her usual style. It was cartoonish, but gruesome cartoonish, like the new breed of comic books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Kait thought it might be a picture of her beating Gabriel to death with a rolling pin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those long tear-shaped things flying out at the edges were flames. Flames, fire. It was a fireball or an explosion, circular, with smoke billowing every which way, and the shock waves moving outward like ripples on a pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the center was a stick figure of a person. Like Itchy the cat after Scratchy hits him with a flamethrower. Arms waving, legs splayed in a grotesque dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa, ha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that since Kait\u0027s drawings always came true, somebody was going to get burned. Somebody involved with that safe, maybe? Kait tried to recapture what she\u0027d been thinking about while scribbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much. Psychic attacks, Canada, Bri dowsing, Jackal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMac on the astral plane, Renny\u0027s PK. And the safe, of course, even though she\u0027d tried not to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis picture could involve any of those things. Kait had a very bad feeling about it, made worse by a nagging, growing headache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the other picture? The one that was supposed to be visualizing the secret room? Kait looked at it and wanted to slam her fist on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarbage! Trash! Not literally, but the drawing was useless. It wasn\u0027t the inside of a room at all, and it certainly didn\u0027t show a crystal. It was a line drawing of a sailing ship on a pretty, wavy ocean. Sitting on the deck, right below the sails, was a Christmas tree. A nice little Christmas tree with garland and a star on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s eyes were stinging with pain and fury. The first picture left her helpless. The second was useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that makes me completely hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly she couldn\u0027t hold her feelings in. She crumpled them up with a savage motion and threw them as hard as she could at Frost. One hit Frost on the cheek, the other hit Frost\u0027s volunteer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaitlyn!\" Joyce shouted. Frost leaped up, one hand to her cheek. Then she made a rush for Kait, her nails clawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frost!\" Joyce shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn put a foot out to block Frost. In elementary school she\u0027d been a pretty good fighter, and right now it felt good to fend Frost off. And if Frost whacked her, she was going to whack right back. She felt calm and queenly standing there ready to kick Frost in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, snowflake,\" she said. \"Come get me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, you!\" Frost shrieked, charging again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, help me! Renny, you stay in that seat!\" Joyce shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce and Gabriel dragged Frost back and sat her down hard in a chair. Kait was tempted to go after her, but didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Joyce said in a voice to cut through steel, \"what is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got mad,\" Kaitlyn said, not at all sorry. \"Everything I draw is trash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smash,\" Bri said quietly. Kait had an urge to snicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce was staring at Kait, lips compressed, brow furrowed. Abruptly, she pulled the tape off Kait\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad. I have a headache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Joyce muttered. \"All right, you go upstairs and lie down. But first you pick up those papers and put them in the trash can where they belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiff-backed, Kait stalked over to the crumpled wads, picked them up. Then, as Joyce turned back to her clipboard, she faked throwing them at Frost again. Frost went red, and Kait hurried out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, she shut the door of her bedroom and wondered what had come over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she crazy? No, of course-it was the crystal. Joyce had used a big piece of the crystal and it had made Kaitlyn act like the psycho psychics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I must be pretty crazy to start with, because it didn\u0027t take much, Kaitlyn thought. Maybe Bri and the others were a lot saner than me to begin with. I wish I could have seen them before . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out her breath, trying to make sense of her feelings. She\u0027d really been furious there, furious and completely indifferent to any consequences her actions might have. She\u0027d would happily have scratched Frost\u0027s eyes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe that wasn\u0027t so crazy. After all...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn sat on the bed heavily. She kept trying to tell herself she didn\u0027t care about Gabriel-but if she didn\u0027t care, why did she hate Frost so much today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Gabriel certainly didn\u0027t jump up to defend me, she thought. He probably enjoyed watching us fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait rubbed her throbbing forehead, wishing she could go outside and lie under a tree. She needed air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdly, she toyed with the balls of paper in her other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked up as the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come in? My riding lesson was canceled this morning,\" Lydia said. She sounded depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your room,\" Kaitlyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept rolling the paper balls around, squashing them against each other. She\u0027d taken them so Frost wouldn\u0027t pick them out of the trash can and laugh at them-but was that the only reason? Now she wondered if it hadn\u0027t also been some survival instinct kicking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of her drawings was really worthless. Maybe she\u0027d better keep them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Lydia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait frowned. Lydia was picking now to talk? \"I\u0027ve got a headache,\" she said shortly, and dropped the paper balls in a drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she remembered her promise to Lewis. She glanced at Lydia out of the side of her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smaller girl looked very neat in a brown riding habit. Her heavy dark hair was pulled away from her small pale face, and her green eyes showed up more than ever. Neat and rich-and miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you got a boyfriend?\" Kait asked abruptly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? No.\" She hesitated, then added, \"I\u0027m not after Gabriel, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t.\" Kait didn\u0027t want to talk about Gabriel. \"I was thinking about Lewis-did you ever notice him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia looked startled-almost frightened. \"Lewis! You mean Lewis Chao?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean Lewis and Clark. Of course Lewis Chao. What do you think of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... he was nice to me. Even when the rest of you weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he thinks you\u0027re nice, too. And I told him-\" Kaitlyn caught herself. Oh, Lord, this headache was making her stupid. She\u0027d almost said that she\u0027d told Lewis yesterday she\u0027d bring him up. Frantically, she tried to think of another way to end the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him that you\u0027d think you were too good for him. That you\u0027d just laugh at him. That was a long time ago,\" Kaitlyn finished at random.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia\u0027s eyes seemed to turn a darker green. \"I wouldn\u0027t laugh. I like nice guys,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re very nice. You\u0027re turning out just like them,\" she added, and left the room, slamming the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn leaned back against the headboard, convinced she just wasn\u0027t cut out to be a spy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she still didn\u0027t feel quite herself. One thing was certain, she couldn\u0027t let Joyce put her in contact with the crystal again. It made her lose control, and when she lost control anything could happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another thing was certain, too. She couldn\u0027t use her power to visualize the hidden room downstairs, and Joyce wasn\u0027t going to let her anywhere near it. So the only solution was for her to go down there herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Passion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill rubbing her forehead, Kaitlyn toed her sneakers off and lay down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she shut her eyes just to ease the headache. But soon her thoughts began to unwind and her muscles relaxed. This time there were no nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she woke she had that feeling of desertion again. The house seemed too quiet, the warm air too still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least her headache was gone. Moving slowly, she got off the bed and tiptoed to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, they wouldn\u0027t leave me alone again. Not unless it\u0027s a trap. If it\u0027s a trap, I\u0027m not going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had a right to go downstairs. She lived here; she was a full member of the team. She could be going down to get a diet soda or an apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the stairs, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had a right to look around downstairs. She could be looking for the others; she could be lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept the right words on her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joyce, I just wanted to ask you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Joyce wasn\u0027t in her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you guys still testing-?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the front lab was empty.
