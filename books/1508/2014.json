When she was just a dozen some years old, she had met Lin Ming. This High Master had given her a great deal of advice. Many times, the seemingly insignificant pieces of advice left her perceiving them for many days whereupon she would end up greatly benefiting from them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs she grew stronger, she felt more and more that this High Master was someone with a long story behind him, and his strength was also a mystery.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe had once quietly asked the Elder of the Yan Family about him. However, the Elder couldn’t detect anything unusual about Lin Ming.

They were able to track his growth from the time he was a youth until present. It was hard for anyone to think he was actually some peak master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBut even so, Yan Ke’er still stubbornly believed that Lin Ming was hiding his depths. From the outside, he looked like a lazy and melancholic individual, and the people of the Heaven and Earth Alliance also thought this. But, Yan Ke’er could faintly feel that the reasoning behind his attitude had to do with his hidden story.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePerhaps this High Master was a Holy Lord!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYan Ke’er had once come up with this bold guess.

But if they grew strong enough that they could kill some minor juniors of the saint race, then this would draw the attention of even stronger saint martial artists.
