The piercing pain in his ribs and head was still unfamiliar, momentarily confusing him when he woke. He frowned at his surroundings, rubbing at his eyes. It was well into the afternoon. Had he slept through the entire night and morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body was still shaking; his sheets were soaked with sweat. He\u0027d dreamed of Ethan\u0027s fianc¨¦e on the cold flagstones, head framed by her blood shining in the moonlight. But instead of seeing her glazed, sightless eyes, Hugh saw Jane, cold and still in death. He shuddered just remembering it -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell is she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard her in her room, getting dressed, he let out a relieved breath. After rising in stages, he staggered to the basin, wetted a cloth, then ran it over himself to wash the chill sweat from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer light footsteps sounded in the hall outside his room as she made her way downstairs. He dressed as quickly as his injuries would allow, then followed. When he eased down the steps and into the kitchen, he found her motionless, staring blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing he noticed was that her bruise had darkened and spread since yesterday, and he flinched to see it. Then his gaze landed on the object of her rapt attention - theLeabhar .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed to her side, silent. Even after all this time, the mysteries of the book still stunned even him. He wondered again how many of his forefathers had futilely tried to burn it or bury it in a locked chest, desperate to rid themselves of it. But theLeabhar was tied to his family like a disease passed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t be the same,\" she said softly. \"I threw it in the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S-someone must have dragged it up from the bottom. You got M¨°rag\u0027s brothers to retrieve it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dry, Jane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a jest. It has to be,\" she insisted. \"There\u0027s more than one book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened to the last page with the distinct blood stains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gaped at it in horrified wonder. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is why I dinna care if you threw it in. TheLeabhar always finds its way back to a MacCarrick. Do you still think this is naught but superstition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her forehead. \"I...I don\u0027t...\" She was saved from answering when the loud nicker of horses sounded down the drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he strode to the window, she asked, \"Who can that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA coach pulled to a stop at the front entrance. Hugh spied a man stepping out, and panic rioted in his chest. \"It\u0027s...Quin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh knew his telegraph would have arrived at Weyland\u0027s yesterday morning; Quin must have set out at once, taking the daily rail to Scotland, then crossing the distance from a station to here by coach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuin could only be here for one of two reasons. He\u0027d come to collect Jane - though Hugh hadn\u0027t asked him to, not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr he\u0027d come to deliver news of Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh turned to her, but she was already ascending the stairs, her back ramrod straight, no doubt thinking Hugh had telegraphed her cousin to rush up here and collect her at the first opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Quin could make the front steps, Hugh threw open the door and met him. \"Why\u0027re you here?\" he demanded. \"Have you heard anything about Ethan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuin answered, \"We were just receiving the latest dispatches in London when I got your message.\" His expression was guarded. \"We haven\u0027t been able to find him. I do know that witnesses heard gun report and saw two men yanking Ethan\u0027s body into an alley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To rob him or aid him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know - only that he\u0027d definitely been shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely been shot.Hugh stepped back to keep himself from pitching forward. He\u0027d blindly held on to the belief that Ethan lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could still be alive,\" Quin said. \"We\u0027re combing the area, and Weyland will let you know if anything breaks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh didn\u0027t trust others to look for his brother - he needed to be out there searching. His brows drew together. \"But why areyou here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuin answered, \"Weyland wants the list destroyed or delivered into his possession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s destroyed. Then why\u0027re you in a coach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To retrieve Jane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dinna send for you to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but you also didn\u0027t tell us that she was staying with you, just that she was safe here and had heard a great deal from Grey. As Weyland observed, your message said more than was written. Was I wrong to come for her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the fall morning air, Hugh had begun sweating again, reminding him of haunting scenes from the night....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he didn\u0027t answer, Quin snapped, \"Goddamn it, man, make a decision and quickly. You\u0027re affecting others\u0027 lives now. And I won\u0027t watch you toying with my cousin any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0027 toying with her,\" Hugh said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not on purpose, but the end is still the same - and it\u0027s been going on for years!\" Quin was the only male in Jane\u0027s generation and was like an older brother to all the cousins, but especially to Jane who was an only child. Hugh understood Quin\u0027s anger and didn\u0027t begrudge him for it. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027s been too proud to tell you this, but Jane\u0027s been in love with you since she was young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ken that.\" Unbelievable as it seemed to Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuin didn\u0027t hide his look of surprise. \"Then what is it? Is it because you think she can do better? I hate to tell you this, MacCarrick, but she can. I know what you are and what you\u0027ve done.\" He lowered his voice. \"Now that the list is destroyed, you\u0027re going right back to work. Would you leave her behind each week as you sneak off to make a kill? What kind of life would that be for her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows about me. And if I kept her as my wife, I would no\u0027continue ,\" he said, as if he was arguing to keep her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll stay at home with her? Try to be domestic?\" he asked, his voice full of derision. \"How will you fit in with her friends and family, when you simply don\u0027t know how? My God, you couldn\u0027t sit a gathering before you turned killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Hugh had been too long in the field, and was sodifferent from the people in her life anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can\u0027t make a decision,\" Quin said, his tone low and seething, \"I\u0027ll bloody make it for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dream, the ominous reminder of the book, Quin\u0027s arrival - what more did Hugh need to see to realize he had to let her go...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Hugh needed to see Jane at the door with her bags packed, her mien stoic, and jaw battered. Hell, after the events of yesterday and the sight of the book this morning, she likely wouldn\u0027t have stayed with him anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuin sucked in a breath at the sight of her face. \"My God, Jane. Are you all right?\" When she nodded, Quin shot Hugh a black look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane was dressed for travel, her bags at her feet. She was truly leaving. Today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re goin\u0027 with him?\" Hugh asked, his voice breaking a pitch lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else would I do?\" She smoothed her skirts. \"I\u0027m glad you sent for him when the threat passed. Very forward-thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dinna - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so as well,\" Quin interrupted. \"Doing the right thing for both of you. Jane, we need to get on the road if we intend to catch the train in Perth. Say good-bye and come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she nodded absently, Quin collected her bags, then strode to the carriage - because they were leaving. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh had known he and Jane would part, but he\u0027d thought he would have time to prepare himself. He turned back to Jane, staring down at her. \"I was going to see you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think Quin can keep me safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. Now. But I wanted to get you settled in, before - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beforeyou leave again?\" She shrugged, her face cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We knew it would come to this. No reason to prolong it unnecessarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled, running a shaking hand over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both have to get on with our lives,\" she continued. \"This is what you want, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doona want you to go yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What doyou bloody want?\" Was he sweating more? He couldn\u0027t stop seeing that dream before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice quavering with emotion, she said, \"We\u0027re back to the simple choice. We put the curse behind us. Or you refuse, and once I leave here today, I will never want to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t promise her he would disregard or forget something that had molded him and he couldn\u0027t easily give her loss, which was all she would have with him. But he had to know...\"You\u0027d be willing to be with me, even after everything you learned?\" he asked, wishing she would say no. To find the one woman who could accept him, and to find her inJane would be too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be willing totry , to see,\" she finally answered. \"To maybe understand everything better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after seeing the book?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s something I don\u0027t think I willever understand.\" She shivered. \"Yes, when I look at it, I fear it - but I also know we could be stronger than anything written there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane was here for the taking, ready to face hell for Hugh - and it humbled him. But shouldn\u0027t he be ready to do the same for her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane, come along!\" Quin called from the carriage. \"We have to make a train.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to Hugh. \"If I leave here today, it\u0027s over. Forever, Hugh. I must move on from this.\" Her voice dropped to a whisper. \"If you don\u0027t choose me now, you never will. But the sad thing is that one day you\u0027ll realize what you threw away.\" When he was silent, her eyes watered. \"And I promise you, it\u0027ll be too late to get it back.\" She turned toward the carriage. Just as she was about to climb in, Jane stopped and strode back to Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d seen reason - she would stay with Hugh for a week more, aday more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cracking slap to his face took him completely off guard. \"That was for the last ten years.\" She slapped the other side of his face, even harder. \"And that\u0027s for the next!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inever thought I\u0027d say this,\" her father began, as he nervously regarded Jane\u0027s face, \"but perhaps you ought to just cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuin had suggested the same thing repeatedly on their journey back to London, right up until he\u0027d deposited her in her father\u0027s study. She\u0027d been home for an hour - long enough for her father to finish explaining what he and Hugh and everyone else did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\"I\u0027m numb . When had her voice begun to sound so tinny?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a sip of her iced Scotch, defying him to say anything about her drinking so early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure this has all been a blow to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you competing for the most patent understatement?\" She rolled her eyes. \"I mean, really, Papa,imports ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged helplessly, and she sighed. He\u0027d finally been totally forthcoming with her - she thought. She\u0027d been markedly less so about Hugh\u0027s reasons for letting her go. \"Who knows what he\u0027s thinking?\" she\u0027d said to him and to Quin. \"He made comments like he thought he wasn\u0027t good enough for me....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane, you keep saying you\u0027re fine, but you don\u0027t look it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she\u0027d been on the verge of crying since she\u0027d first comprehended that Quin was there to retrieve her. In fact, she\u0027d been as close to it as she\u0027d ever been, without actually spilling tears. As she\u0027d absently packed her things, she\u0027d somehow prevented herself because she\u0027d known that with her first tear, she might start something she couldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\" She gingerly touched the chilled glass on her swollen jaw, but the pain made her wince, and her father flinch - again. \"This has all been a lot for me to digest. I see you and Quin and even Rolley, and I feel like you\u0027re strangers.\" She\u0027d tried to put on a strong front when facing each of them, but for right now, all she could seem to manage was a wary indifference. \"And Hugh? I had an idea of him for half my life. Now that\u0027s...changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t angry about Hugh\u0027s role in deceiving her. He had a job to do, and after talking to her father, she better understood the seriousness and significance of what he did. One of his bullets could spare a million of them in some needless war, and yet his job was lonely and grueling and he would never receive credit - or support if he\u0027d been captured. She\u0027d forgiven Hugh - for this, at least - but her father? \"As for you, well, perhaps you might have provided a bit more warning about all this, and a lot less pressuring me to marry an assassin. Just a thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father couldn\u0027t meet her eyes - and she\u0027d noticed that for the last hour, he\u0027d avoided looking at her mother\u0027s portrait as well. \"I regret what I did. But I swear that I believed Hugh would come around and do the right thing. The man has been in love with you for so long, and he\u0027s always been honorable. But then, you understand that - you\u0027ve always understood that. Jane, do you know how proud I was of you for choosing a man like Hugh? You saw things in him others couldn\u0027t. I thought the two of you were perfect for each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe almost were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure that you made it clear you were in love with him? And that you wanted to remain married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a sound of frustration. \"You - have - no - idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe briefly raised his palms in the air. \"Yes, yes, very well. I won\u0027t ask again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you propose I do now?\" She rotated the glass against her cheek to the cooler side and added, \"With all the money from my dowry that you\u0027ll be giving me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quirked a brow, but wisely said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really have no idea what a woman in my situation does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane, I know I promised you I could smooth this over with Frederick, but\" - he tugged on his collar - \"he\u0027s not precisely available any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\" she asked without interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s engaged to Candace Damferre. Her husband expired with no heir, leaving her everything. Bidworth\u0027s, uh, quite beside himself that they\u0027re both free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would Jane have done, weeks into marriage with Freddie, when his true love became free? Hugh might not have been able to give her a love-filled marriage, but he\u0027d helped her father save her from a completely loveless one. \"I\u0027m happy for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you truly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I couldn\u0027t have gone back with him anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I promised you something I wasn\u0027t completely sure of because I was positive it would work out with you and Hugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Don\u0027t feel guilty on that score, at least. You told me you could work all this out with Freddie,\" Jane began with a careless flick of her hand, \"if the marriage to Hugh was unconsummated.\" She glanced up and frowned. \"Your face is an interesting shade of red, Papa. Really remarkable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fists were clenched. \"I\u0027m going to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, it seems\" - she glanced both ways with exaggerated slyness and hushed her voice - \"that I have to clarify if you mean literally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last week, Hugh had combed the small lakeside village and all the surrounding areas for word of his brother. After days of doggedly chasing down every lead, Hugh was no closer to discovering anything to indicate whether Ethan was dead or alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Quin had said, many had heard gunshots, and some shopkeepers saw two men dragging Ethan\u0027s lifeless body into an alley. One might have spied a very slim man loping down the street. The bottom line was that Ethan had disappeared, and Hugh had no more leads to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor had he any idea where to go or what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout Jane, nothing held appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, his life had at least had some purpose, but he didn\u0027t know if he could go back to his occupation. Yes, the odds had been against Hugh reverting to a normal life - but, damn it, hehad changed. Jane had changed him, and he had to wonder if he could return to that same existence. Besides, if it was true that Weyland always knew everything, then he now knew that Hugh had compromised Jane - and then all but kicked her out. He feared Weyland had washed his hands of Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his place, Hugh would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh\u0027s official missives to Weyland were responded to promptly, but coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not having Jane in his life had been painful before, now it was agonizing. Hugh knew exactly what he was missing. Worse, he knew how badly he\u0027d hurt her. The more he thought about that morning, the more he regretted letting her go. But what choice did he have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere to go?He hadn\u0027t been to Cape Waldegrave for almost a year. He should go check on his estate and see if any improvements needed to be made - then do them all himself. Beinn a\u0027Chaorainn was on his way there. He could pay M¨°rag in advance to oversee the property. He could pick up the rest of his things and close down the house for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo go there and not hear Jane\u0027s laughter? Hell, who was he fooling? He just planned to go there to do eighty thousand pounds\u0027 worth of brooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane\u0027s cousins were hovering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudia had basically moved in, and Belinda and Samantha visited as often as they could between time with their husbands and children. Today, Claudia and Belinda were flipping through fashion plates, smoking French cigarettes, and raiding Jane\u0027s clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the last two weeks, Jane hadn\u0027t had an hour to herself. Apparently, when Jane had returned home, she\u0027d worried her entire family with her mottled jaw and insouciant demeanor. But now the bruise on Jane\u0027s face had healed, and her headaches had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe often wondered if Hugh had completely recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she reflected over her time with him, she could think of only one thing she\u0027d have done differently, even after all that had occurred between them. \"Trust me with your secret and you won\u0027t regret it,\" she\u0027d told him. She felt a flush of guilt, knowing he would have to regret it. She\u0027d demonstrated no understanding or compassion, but then she\u0027d never felt such fury, such strangling frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane had comprehended that she was losing the only man she\u0027d ever loved - and that all the fight she had in her wouldn\u0027t change that fact. Because she was losing him to something that didn\u0027t truly exist....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Janey,\" Claudia began in a scolding tone, \"are you thinking about Tears and Years again?\" She shook her head slowly. \"We don\u0027t think about him any longer, do we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor obvious reasons she hadn\u0027t told them what Hugh\u0027s profession was. For some unknown reason, she hadn\u0027t confided to them about the curse. Though telling them about it would actually have made Hugh more sympathetic to them, she knew Hugh wouldn\u0027t want them to know. As it was now, they suspected he let her go out of shortsighted stubbornness or, taken with his past behavior, inconstancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShehad told them she\u0027d made love to Hugh, and they\u0027d all counted down the days together until she could determine whether she was carrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane had been relieved that she wasn\u0027t, of course. But she\u0027d also felt a confusing pang....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane, I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve reminded you today,\" Claudia said, flicking her mane of raven hair over her shoulder, \"that you spent adecade of your life pining for him.\" She gave Jane a piercing look. \"You can\u0027t get those years back. Gone. Spent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time Claudia had made this observation, Belinda had chided her, saying, \"Jane needs to look to the future, not dwell on the past.\" Now she said, \"Claudia\u0027s right. It\u0027s been two weeks, Jane. You\u0027ve got to at leastbegin to get over him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudia made a sound of frustration. \"My Lord, Jane, I think you\u0027d take him back - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare think that!\" Jane snapped. \"I\u0027m not a complete idiot. Getting thrown over by the man I\u0027ve loved - not once, buttwice , mind you - destroyed any hopes for a rekindling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things remind me of him. And every time I look at my father\u0027s guilty expression, it kills me inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a firm nod, Claudia said, \"Right, then. I think getting over him would be more easily done while traveling, perhaps to Italy, where gorgeous, virile men abound.\" When Jane raised her brows at the idea, Claudia continued, \"Haven\u0027t you ever heard the old saying? The best way to get over a man is to get under an Italian.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-21.html","bookId":2645,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 PM"}
