(2)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “Don’t strip her outer clothes either… we have to give Shen Bu some face, women are extremely terrifying when they go crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er said with a discontented tone: “Now then your heart feels tender? When Shen Bu wanted to marry her off to you, why did you reject her then, instead chosing to come here to be a Battalion Commander…” The officers of the Ruffian Battalion stood jaw agape at the side listening to them, staring at Zhou Weiqing in shock. This new Battalion Commander of theirs was truly something different!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked at her exasperatedly and said: “Alright, enough, wake her up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did Shangguan Fei’er suddenly realise that her actions were a little strange… almost as if she was being… jealous. Giving Shen Yi a swift kick, she stood back beside Zhou Weiqing’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShen Yi’s body shuddered slightly and she opened her eyes slowly, her hand moving subconsciously to her aching neck. All of a sudden, she felt the cold wind on her body, and her heart stilled in fright, her eyes opening wide abruptly, only to see Zhou Weiqing and the rest of the Peerless Battalion staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahhhh!” A shrill shriek pierced the air, and Shen Yi subconsciously used her hands to cover her chest, protecting her not-too-large bosom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing glanced at her and said grinningly: “Don’t be afraid, I am not interested in yours, as flat as a racecourse as it is.” After saying that, he felt a sharp pain in his waist, as Shangguan Fei’er had given him a savage pinch due to his shameless words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s face twitched from the pain, though he tried his best to control himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the viewpoint of the Peerless Battalion soldiers, they could not see Shangguan Fei’er’s actions, but Shen Yi, who was on the floor, could easily see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing her own armour in Shangguan Fei’er’s hands, and the closeness that their little actions showed, when Shen Yi looked back at Zhou Weiqing, there was a weird look in her eyes besides the panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder you refused to marry me… no wonder… you actually like him?!” As she said that, Shen Yi’s gaze landed on Shangguan Fei’er. She clearly remembered how this person had subdued her so easily… ‘His’ cultivation level and power was definitely at least as strong as that Zhou Little Fatty, or perhaps even higher, yet he was willing to just be a follower… What else could this be? She had never expected that Zhou Little Fatty would actually like men!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er froze in place, and due to a strange sense of guilt, she lowered her head subconsciously. Alas, in others’ eyes, that was tantamount to admitting it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Peerless Battalion officers who were standing beside Zhou Weiqing all took a step back, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a strange look on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at Shangguan Fei’er, then back at Shen Yi, Zhou Weiqing said helplessly: “Who Your Father, I, likes is none of your business. Gather your men and leave. Go back and tell Shen Bu that I don’t have much interest in the heavy cavalry equipment, let her bring money to exchange. However, the bows, horses and shields are ours now. The heavy armour and horses armour can all be sold back to you; two hundred gold per set. Next time, bring the money to exchange for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShen Yi clambered back to her feet, looking angrily at Zhou Weiqing as she said: “You just wait, my sister will not let you off so easily.” After saying that, she turned and left. Without needing Zhou Weiqing to open his mouth, Wei Feng motioned for the Peerless Battalion to move aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Shen Yi saw her heavy cavalry troops all in their underpants, she almost fainted. As a young lady who lived a relatively sheltered life in that regard, seeing a whole horde of men almost fully naked, how could she stand it. Without looking back, she ran off ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the company of soldiers leave in their sorry state, Zhou Weiqing gave the order for the Peerless Battalion to return to camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack Bear sidled over and said: “Battalion Commander, you don’t really like men do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing glanced at him, then licked his lips. “That’s right, Your Father, I, loves men, especially such robust and strong men like you. Tonight, you come to my tent all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh? Noooo!” Black Bear yelled out and ran off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a cold humph, turning back to the other Peerless Battalion soldiers and shouted an order: “Beat up Black Bear, so much so that his own mother won’t even recognize him. If you do so, I’ll cook some meat for you all to eat tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing that there would be meat to eat, the group of brigand soldiers instantly became a pack of wolves that smelled blood, their eyes lighting up instantly as they charged forward. Before long, Black Bear’s cries of agony rang out. A brave man cannot withstand against a horde of foxes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you dare like men, ‘Your Mother, I[1. Think I’ve mentioned this before, literal translation, more like how they say Your Father, I, more like an arrogant way of saying I]’ will chop yours off.” Shangguan Fei’er’s angry voice rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng and the others, who had been watching Black Bear get beaten up with an amused look on their faces, instantly turned to look at her with a surprised expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you looking at? I’m a woman, what about it?” Shangguan Fei’er yelled with a mix of anger and exasperation. She could not stand Zhou Weiqing being thought of as a homosexual by these subordinates, so she had unthinkingly admitted she was a woman, and she also resumed using her normal voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng stared at Zhou Weiqing, his jaw agape, before finally saying: “Battalion Commander, you actually brought your wife along to join the army?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing coughed once embarrassedly, but Shangguan Fei’er jumped to speak before he could. “Little Fatty, look, this Peerless Battalion of ours seems to lack a trainer! In order to let them raise their power as soon as possible, let me be their trainer, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she said that, Shangguan Fei’er lifted her hand, stripping off her mask and revealing her face of peerless beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Peerless Battalion ruffian soldiers had been cooped up here for a long time, and besides using the ‘ten women’ and the ‘left right ultimate skill’ [1. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I translated that literally, I’m sure you guys can figure out what that means heh. The ‘left right ultimate skill’ or \u003ca href\u003d\"http://baike.baidu.com/view/1663724.htm?fromtitle\u003d%E5%B7%A6%E5%8F%B3%E4%BA%92%E6%90%8F\u0026amp;fromid\u003d6541654\u0026amp;type\u003dsyn\"\u003e左右互搏 Zuo You Hu Bo Skill\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e is the famed skill from the Jin Yong stories Legend of Condor Heroes/ Return of Condor Heroes where he is able to use both hands to strike out with different styles of martial arts] to deal with their physiological problems, there was no other way. Let alone a woman, even a sow would have been a cordial sight to their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith such an unbelievable beauty appearing right before their eyes, Wei Feng and the others couldn’t help but stare, some with less control even drooling in joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I beautiful” Shangguan Fei’er said with a saccharine sweetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing palmed his forehead and groaned, quickly turning to leave. When the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Little Demon Girl acted like this, there was nothing good that would come out of it, he had better leave as soon as possible. Before doing so, he specially dragged Wei Feng away as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Battalion Commander, why did you drag me away?” Wei Feng said resentfully, his eyes still fixed greedily upon Shangguan Fei’er as he was forced away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t want to die, you better come with me now.” Zhou Weiqing said softly, forcibly dragging him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng was angry in his heart, thinking to himself: \u003ci\u003eEven if that is your woman, can’t I even have a look?!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it wasn’t long before that anger vanished. After being dragged about twenty metres away, he suddenly saw Green Wolf and the others as if somehow provoked, leaping towards Shangguan Fei’er as a group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Wei Feng was dumbfounded, stricken with fear. He had experienced and seen Zhou Weiqing’s strength, and if his woman were to be attacked just like that, how could Zhou Weiqing let them off like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, to Wei Feng’s surprise, Zhou Weiqing did not even bother looking back, continuing to drag him towards his tent. At that moment, the group of pouncing men were all sent flying back one by one like cannon balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA symphony of painful cries rang out in a rhythm, increasingly louder. Wei Feng could see Shangguan Fei’er moving in a flash, barely catching her illusory figure as she jumped around, as if juggling the group of them. Anyone who came within three yards of her would be sent flying savagely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene blackened before him. Zhou Weiqing had successfully dragged him into the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Battalion Commander… that…” Wei Feng said dully, still in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shook his head helplessly and said: “Now then you know right… Provoking that Little Demon Girl will never end well. Do you think my strength is abnormal, not like a Four Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master?” Wei Feng nodded; after all it was the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing continued: “Fei’er is even more abnormal than I am… and more so, her cultivation level is at the six Jewels. You can think for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng shivered involuntarily. By now, how could he not understand? “Battalion Commander, thank you for saving me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Looks like Green WOolf and the others will not be able to join tonight’s operation. Wei Feng, do you have the map of the northern armies, the more detailed the better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng’s heart skipped a beat and he said: “Battalion Commander, why do you need a map? Are you trying to get revenge on the Sixteenth Regiment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a disdainful humph and said: “Revenge? What good is that? Didn’t I say before, our Peerless Battalion will not do anything that does not profit us? Didn’t you hear me say that I’ll let our brothers have meat to eat tomorrow, if we don’t go out and get some, how are they going to eat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng’s eyes narrowed. “Battalion Commander… you… aren’t going to rob the grain depot are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “Rob? What rob? We are going to collect. Originally, I was going to do so three days later, but since Shen Bu has given us such a big gift today, we shall take action tonight, collect some supplies and let our brothers have a good meal first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudacious to the extreme; that was Wei Feng’s appraisal of Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing his hesitant eyes, Zhou Weiqing clapped Wei Feng on the shoulder and said: “Don’t worry, it will be fine. Quick, bring me the map to look at first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Feng had no choice but to leave quickly to do so, leaving Zhou Weiqing alone in the tent. The cries of agony from outside were still unending, evoking bad memories and sending chills down Zhou Weiqing’s spine. Luckily, he was not the one screaming out right now…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at that moment, the tent flapped opened and Shangguan Fei’er entered. “That was boring, what a bunch of weaklings, they can’t even take a beating. Just a few hits and they can’t even get up… Little Fatty, I’m just about having fun now, come on out, let’s spar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stared at her, dumbfounded. Currently, due to a large amount of exertions, her beautiful face had a pink flush, looking valiant and healthy. Although she was wearing an ordinary army uniform, her radiant beauty was just too stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uhhh… Fei’er, tonight we have a big operation to run, it will be fun. Do you want to come along?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an impassive look, Zhou Weiqing swiftly changed the topic. He did not want to end up in the same state as those fellows outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, Shangguan Fei’er’s interest was piqued. “Big operation? Doing what? Of course I want to go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-127-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-127-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-127-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
