One shoe right on top of the other in that vast, barren valley below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she slid a rubber band off her wrist,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReached behind her . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd pulled her hair\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto a knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then this girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis girl . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed her hands right next to mine on the edge of that cliff and she slowly began to lower herself off of it.

When I descend the stage and take a seat back at the table, Eddie stands up, wiping tears from her eyes. She looks down at me and frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it kill you to do something funny for once?” She storms toward the bathroom, I’m assuming to fix her makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Gavin and laugh, but he’s staring back at me with his arms folded in front of him on the table. “Will, I think I’ve got an idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pertaining to . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You,” he says. He gestures toward the stage, “and your . . . situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward. “What about my situation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know someone,” he says. “She works with my mom. She’s your age, cute, in college.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately shake my head. “No. No chance,” I say, leaning back into the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will, you can’t be with Layken. If your poem had anything to do with her, which I’m thinking it had everything to do with her, then you need to find a way to get over this. If you don’t, you’ll end up screwing up your entire career over this girl. A girl you went on one date with. One!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue to shake my head at his reasoning. “I’m not looking for a girlfriend, Gavin. I wasn’t even looking for anything when I met Lake. I’m fine with where I am right now; I definitely don’t need to add even more female drama into the picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t be adding more drama. You’ll be filling an obvious void in your life. You need to date. Eddie was right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was I right about?” Eddie says, returning to her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin gestures toward me. “About Will. He needs to date. Don’t you think he and Taylor would hit it off?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie perks up. “I didn’t even think about her! Yes! Will, you’re gonna love her,” she says excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not letting you guys set me up.” I grab my jacket. “I’ve got to get back home. See you guys in class tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie and Gavin both stand. “I’ll get her number tomorrow,” Eddie says. “Is next Saturday night okay? You two could double date with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going.” I walk away without turning back or giving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe honeymoon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OKAY,” LAKE SAYS. “Two things. One. That poem was . . . heartbreakingly beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like its subject,” I say. I lean in to kiss her but she brings her hand up and pushes my face away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two,” she says, narrowing her eyes. “Gavin and Eddie tried to set you up with someone?” She huffs and sits up on the bed. “Good thing you didn’t agree to it. I don’t care how screwed up our situation was, there’s no way I would have dated anyone else considering the way I felt about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly change the subject before she realizes that, although I didn’t agree to it, Eddie is pretty damn persistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, now for Friday night,” I say, successfully taking her mind off the date. “Your mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” she says, finding a comfortable spot next to me and throwing her leg over mine. “My mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecrets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“PASTA AGAIN?” CAULDER whines. He grabs his plate of food from the counter and takes it to the bar and sits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t like it, learn how to cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like it,” Kel says. “My mom cooks a lot of vegetables and chicken. That’s probably why I’m so small, because I’m malnouredish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and correct him. “It’s malnourished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKel rolls his eyes. “That’s what I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my own bowl and fill it with pasta . . . again. We do have pasta at least three times a week, but there are only two of us. I don’t see the point in making expensive meals when it’s just me and a nine-year-old most of the time. I take a seat at the bar across from the two boys and fill all of our glasses with tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suck and sweet time,” Caulder says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s suck and sweet?” Kel asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Caulder starts to explain, there’s a knock at the front door. When I reach the door and open it, I’m surprised to find Julia standing in the entryway. Her presence has definitely become more intimidating since the first day I met her; especially after this afternoon when she found out about me being a teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me straight faced, with her hands in the pockets of her scrub top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Hey,” I say, trying not to appear as nervous as I am. “Kel just started eating. If you want, I’ll send him home as soon as he’s done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” she says. She glances over my shoulder at the boys, then looks back at me and lowers her voice to a whisper. “I really wanted to talk to you if you have a few minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seems a little bit nervous, which just makes me ten times more nervous. “Sure.” I step aside and motion for her to come in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys can eat in your room, Caulder. I need to talk to Julia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we haven’t said our suck and sweet for today,” Caulder says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do them in your room. I’ll tell you mine later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys pick up their bowls and drinks and head to Caulder’s room, closing the door behind them. When I turn back to Julia her mouth is curled up in a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suck and sweet?” she says. “Is that your way of getting him to tell you his good and bad for the day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and nod. “We started it about six months ago.” I take a seat on the same couch as her. “It was his therapist’s idea. Although the original version wasn’t called suck and sweet. I sort of ad-libbed that part to make it sound more appealing to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s sweet,” she says. “I should start doing that with Kel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a slight smile but don’t respond. I’m not really sure what she’s doing here or what her intentions are, so I silently wait for her to continue. She takes a deep breath and focuses her gaze on the family picture hanging on the wall across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your parents?” she says, pointing to the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relax into the couch and look up at the picture. “Yeah. My mom’s name was Claire. My dad’s name was Dimas. He was half Puerto Rican—named after his maternal grandfather.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia smiles. “That explains your natural tan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s obvious she’s trying to deflect for some reason. She continues to stare at the picture. “Do you mind if I ask how they met?” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a few hours ago she was ready to rip my head off after finding out I’m Lake’s teacher; now she’s trying to get to know me? Whatever’s going on with her, I’m in no position to question her, so I just go along with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They met in college. Well, my mom was in college. My dad was actually a member of a band that played on her campus. He didn’t go to college until a few years after they met. My mom was on a campus crew that would help set up their shows and they got to know each other. He asked her out and the rest is history. They married two years later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d they do for a living?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom was in human resources. Dad was a . . . he taught English.” Just saying the word teacher in front of her makes me uncomfortable. “Not the best-paying jobs but they were happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs. “That’s what counts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod in agreement. There’s an awkward silence that follows while she slowly scans the pictures on the walls around us. I feel like she wants to bring up everything from earlier today, but maybe she doesn’t know how. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-girl-slammed-3/page-14.html","bookId":2781,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:24:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:24:07 PM"}
