It was a short, slim cane, no more than ten inches long, perhaps made of carbon. Not so intimidating, but she revised that opinion as the first strike landed. Fuck. Like most canes, it hit fast and was gone, but the pain zinged through all her nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit down on the ball in shock and pain. There was no titillation in this, no soft flogger that hit with a nice slap and teasing sting. She’d played with one of those in her dorm room, one she’d made out of nylon rope, imagining him using it on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Count it, Marcie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to get the first finger out. She was pretty sure she was losing her mind, because she chose her middle finger. Damn it, he wasn’t going to break her, or scare her off, or…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, a dangerous threat. “You just doubled it, sweetie, and I don’t have time to slow it down. You better keep up with the count, or I’ll triple it. I plan to leave pretty welts on that rebellious ass of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t think. She tried to push up off the desk. His hand clamped down on the back of her neck, and he pushed her cheek down to the desk surface, locking her down, like a schoolmaster holding down a naughty, struggling student in truth. She snarled against the ball, but it was too big for her to spit it out. Then she had no room to think, because he lived up to his word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo, three, four…in rapid succession, striping over her ass in different places, setting her skin on fire. She started shuddering on number five, her fingers fluttering out on the one hand, palm pressed hard to the desk because she couldn’t balance herself with that powerful hand on her nape. He allowed it. She was crying out against the ball gag with each stroke, no way to bite it back. Her toes curled in her shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lift up against my hand. Don’t you tuck down like a beaten dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched her back, thrust her buttocks up defiantly, screamed as another blow landed. Six…seven, eight, nine… Teeth sunk into that rubber, saliva marking her chin, ass high in the air, legs spread. Every muscle clenched like iron against the pain, she nevertheless got her palms back up where he’d told her to put them, even as he held her face down. She’d show him she could do it. Oh God, there were ten more to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe howled at the eleventh stroke, a direct slap against her labia. Her legs gave out, the pain overcoming her, but he caught her by the waist, her abused buttocks abraded by the summer wool of his slacks. But it also pushed his erection between them, against her throbbing pussy, making her whimper. She tried to rub, she couldn’t help herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-uh, none of that. You’ll get your cream on my clothes. Be still or you’ll get the other nine now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stilled, because hell, she didn’t think she could do nine more, now or later. He guided her palms down to the desk surface, did a quick stroke and tug over her mussed hair. “Stay in the position you’re in. Keep your eyes closed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him move around his desk, unlock a drawer, come back. Then she swallowed against the gag as a smooth and thick plug was pushed into her pussy, worked in and out a few times, then removed to be inserted into her ass instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Figured you’d have enough honey to lube that up.” She made a wordless plea as another plug was inserted back into her cunt, with a piece on the outside that closed over her clit. She felt straps dangling against the backs of her legs, then they were run up between them, and around her waist, cinched tight so all of a sudden she felt those plugs held deeper, more securely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little chastity device to keep you from playing with what’s not yours, hmm?” Ben pulled her skirt down, a functional tug, gave her ass a firm smack. “Keep your eyes closed until you hear me leave. That to-do list better be finished before I get back today, or I’ll add another ten to the nine you owe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis footsteps, moving away. The door opening, then closing, the sound of him voice dialing Johnson’s office, telling them they were on their way, his voice steady, authoritative. It was as if he weren’t the least affected, though she knew he was. He was just that damn much in control. Marcie waited until she couldn’t hear his voice any longer, then she cracked open her eyes. He’d left the handkerchief he carried in his coat neatly folded up near her hand to wipe her mouth…and the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe considerate gesture against the ruthless nature of what he’d just done took her breath, almost made her knees buckle. She’d imagined so many things…but she hadn’t imagined this. He sent her spinning from one direction to another so effortlessly. She’d known she was in over her head, but this was like being at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs crazy wild as all this was, she was sure of one thing. She wanted more. He claimed to be acting as her mentor, but that wasn’t the way she was viewing it. This was a job audition, and she was going to prove exactly what she’d said she would. That she was the slave he needed, that she could handle everything he dished out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough that had certainly been more than she’d ever experienced before. When she moved, she winced at the light movement of fabric over her ass. Removing the gag, she moved to the full length mirror in his closet, where he kept spare changes of clothes. Holding her skirt at her waist, she twisted around to look at her abused flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly God. It was not only red, but she could see the individual marks of the cane, short lines, welts. It should horrify her. Instead, it made her pussy clench against that thick plug he’d put there, her anus contract on the other one. That night at Surreal, he’d left marks like this on the three women. Ben was a sadist who enjoyed exploring the top limits of pain. He wanted the women who served him to earn the pleasure he gave them. It was all tied up together. She thought she would endure almost anything for that. Her body was vibrating with stress, shock…and raging desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d put a chastity device on her, so she’d keep herself only for him, preventing not only the touch of other men, but her own touch. Her body was his, not hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fixed her hair, her face, did some deep breathing. Nothing seemed to steady her hands. The plugs were short, so she could move in them, but that clit piece was sheer torture, rubbing against her as she walked. It wouldn’t move enough to make her come, but she’d remain hyperaware of the desire to fuck, to be fucked, to have an orgasm that would shake the foundations of the building with her screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d left something else at her desk. A small pillow. Like the handkerchief, the gesture made her smile, squeezed her heart. But when she lowered herself to it gingerly, she came back up just as fast. That was when she saw the note he’d left on her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit on this to reinforce the lesson. Else you’ll be thinking too much of misbehaving. No perching on the edge. Square in the middle. If you need to go to the ladies’ room, you may remove what’s necessary, but then the plugs go right back in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassing her hand over the pillow, she felt the tiny pricks through the fabric, like a vampire glove. Not long enough to penetrate skin, but enough to make it feel as if she were being stuck with pins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding white-knuckled to the edge of the desk, she lowered herself onto it. When the barbs dug into her tender ass, she suppressed a groan. She could do this. She could. Though she really wished he’d given her a different punishment, like writing I will not sass Master a million times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA desperate smile crossed her face. No, that wasn’t Ben’s style. He wasn’t treating her like a child. That was what was important. He was making a point. If she couldn’t handle this, she needed to give up now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took steadying breaths, picking up the file she was going to review, the first thing on his to-do list for her. Every minute movement of her body shifted her against that pillow, renewed the agony. One small mercy—the plug for her pussy and the covering for her clit protected those more tender tissues. Though her outer labia were pricked, the clit and inner petals were protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the fact she had no idea how she was going to endure this for the hours he was gone, she was all too aware of the fact she was soaking wet. All she wanted to do was hump herself against the clit piece until she came, screaming through the pain and pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, she was twisted. Twisted for him, willing to endure anything for him, just for the right to call him Master to his face. She used his handkerchief to wipe away the tears that kept falling from her eyes, the result of stress and shock. Her mascara was wasted today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m yours, Master,” she whispered, looking toward his office. “You won’t break me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least not that way. Not until the breaking had to do with him accepting her as his slave, now and forever, and breaking her down so that she could surrender to him utterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was well aware that wasn’t the most difficult problem she faced though. Could she make him believe she truly loved him? Even more challenging, could she get him to realize that he loved her? Because he did. She was sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it’s silly, but I love hand writing letters. How many emails do you think they’ll find in the future, versus packets of love letters people have kept in their treasure boxes, tied up with ribbon? A dried, pressed flower in between them, the fading scent of perfume where a woman offered a man her scent? Plus, I think better when I write it out, and I like the way cursive looks. I could be one of those monks who did the calligraphy and hand printed each book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcie, letter to Ben, sophomore year\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(in cursive, on elegant, scented stationery)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot silly. Little things matter far more than big ones. We remember them longer. We can’t control the big things, brat. If you think about what’s happened in the past, it will be the small moments that come to the forefront, not the big transitions. The big things were just history. The small moments are yours. The books those monks printed are still preserved centuries after they were gone. Little things matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen’s reply\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(in block print, on preschool writing practice paper, oversized and lined)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You going to explain what the hell that was?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hostile-takeover-knights-of-the-board-room-5/page-15.html","bookId":1904,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:18:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:18:30 PM"}
