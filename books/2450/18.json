I\u0027d be so happy if they were winding us up, I wouldn\u0027t care that I\u0027d been made a fool of. I\u0027d laugh, admit I fell for it, hail them as champion pranksters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the blood\u0027s real. The terror. The screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot the first of them coming. A boy I don\u0027t recognize. His sweater and shirt are ripped. His stomach has been carved open. Guts ooze from holes as he lurches forward. His eyes are unfocused, his lips caked with blood. He moves stiffly but purposefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undead boy grabs the girl who screamed. Pulls her hair back. Sinks his teeth into her throat. Rips out a strip of flesh and gurgles happily as blood sprays his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve seen blood fly in fights, movies and computer games. But never like this. Nothing I\u0027ve ever seen before has prepared me for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spell breaks and pandemonium erupts. Everyone\u0027s screaming at once. People run in circles, crash into one another, fall, thrash around on the ground, lash out with their feet and fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore zombies stream into the gym, boys, girls, a couple of teachers. They zone in on the living, hunting like wolves. They have a sweet time of it. In all the mayhem, lots of kids try to rush by them. Easy prey. The zombies just reach out and snatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t moved. I\u0027m watching sickly, numbly studying the undead as they feast on their victims. Some of the kids writhe and curse as they\u0027re bitten, moan and weep and beg for mercy. The zombies don\u0027t care. They tear with their fingers and teeth, bite, claw, rip, chew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that!\" Stuttering Stan roars. He strides forward, blowing his whistle, trying to wave back the zombies. The fool thinks that he can control this, the same way he can control violence on the pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zombie boy my age butts Stuttering Stan in the chest. As the teacher falls back, winded, the boy sticks his fingers into the adult\u0027s left eye and pokes it out. As Stuttering Stan screams, the boy gobbles the eye. Then he falls on his victim and digs through the hole where the eye should be, burrowing through to Stuttering Stan\u0027s brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" Trev shouts, grabbing my arm. \"We have to get out of here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re gonna kill us, B!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the zombies and shake my head. \"Not all of us. There\u0027s a pattern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you talking about?\" he barks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point. The zombies aren\u0027t killing everyone. As each one enters the gym, he or she cuts or bites a few people, leaving them to yell and flee. Only then does the zombie settle on a target, break their skull and dig into their brain. Once they start to feast, they sit there, gorging, ignorant of everything going on around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a pattern,\" I mutter again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can make sense of it, Trev shouts, \"We\u0027re going. You can stay and let them eat you if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him and the others in our gang. They\u0027re racing towards the rear left corner of the gym. My senses click - there\u0027s an emergency exit there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the carnage, the kids going wild, the zombies tucking in. I was in a daze before this, detached and calm. But now that I focus, I realize I\u0027m dead if I don\u0027t move quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sod this!\" I moan, then tear after the others as fast as I can. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-18.html","bookId":2450,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM"}
