Screaming and throwing things would contribute nothing to the situation. \"Your graduate student, Catherine, who is crazy, has murdered your other graduate student, Donald. When you went back to the lab, late this afternoon, you discovered she\u0027d hidden Henry and you don\u0027t know where she is, they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Burke nodded. \"Essentially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for good intentions. \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN, ESSENTIALLY?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcohol-induced remoteness cracked as Vicki grabbed the lapels of Dr. Burke\u0027s lab coat and nearly dragged her over the desk. \"If you could loosen your grip,\" she gasped, \"I might find it easier... to answer your question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki merely snarled inarticulately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detec... tive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci shifted his gaze to a point about six inches over the doctor\u0027s head, expression aggressively neutral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollar cutting into her windpipe, Dr. Burke realized further hesitation would only make things worse. \"She\u0027s in the old Life Sciences building. Your vampiric friend is locked in a big metal box. Trying to maneuver that out the door and into her van would\u0027ve attracted a bit of attention. Where in the building... \" Considering her position, the shrug was credible. \"...I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki didn\u0027t so much release her hold as shove the older woman back into the chair. \"Your lab is in there? In the old building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Rubbing the back of her neck where the fabric had dug in, Dr. Burke snapped, \"And so is your mother. Somewhere.\" She shot a superior look up over the edge of her glasses. \"Your dead mother. Walking around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dead mother. Walking around. Anger couldn\u0027t stand under the weight of that pronouncement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought free of the image of her mother flattened against the window and met Celluci\u0027s worried gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a confession. We can call in Detective Fergusson now. You don\u0027t have to have anything more to do with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice try, Mike.\" She swallowed, trying to wet a throat gone dry. \"But you\u0027re forgetting about Henry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mustn\u0027t forget Henry.\" Above the hand still rubbing at her throat, Dr. Burke almost grinned. \"I\u0027d love to hear you explain him to the local police. Until you find Henry, you\u0027ve got to keep this quiet. And after? What about after?\" She shook her head at their expressions and sighed, placing both hands flat on her desk. \"Never mind, I\u0027ll tell you. There won\u0027t be an after. Until Catherine contacts me, you haven\u0027t a chance of finding your friend. There\u0027s a million stupid, useless cubbyholes in that building and she could\u0027ve stuck him in any of them. You\u0027re just going to have to sit here with me and wait for her phone call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I play along, she tells me where she\u0027s stashed him, you get him out, call the police, and she pays for Donald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"And you\u0027ll pay for my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Nelson, if it makes you happy, I\u0027ll even pay for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if she doesn\u0027t call?\" Celluci demanded, cutting off Vicki\u0027s response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said she would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said she\u0027s crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, I can\u0027t wait.\" Vicki took four steps toward the door, turned on one heel, and took three steps back. \"I can\u0027t base everything on what a crazy woman may or may not do. I\u0027m going to find him. She... \" A toss of her head indicated the doctor. \"... can take us to the lab. We\u0027ll work a search pattern from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on your life.\" She wasn\u0027t going near the lab. Bad enough she could still hear him calling her in spite of half a bottle of Scotch. \"You\u0027ll have to drag me. Which might alert Security. There\u0027ll be a brouhaha. Your Henry Fitzroy ends up confiscated by the government. You want to go to the lab, you can find it on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki leaned forward, laying her hands on the desk, fingertips not quite touching the doctor\u0027s, her posture more of a threat than her earlier actions had been. \"Then you\u0027ll give us very precise directions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or you\u0027ll what? Try to pay attention, Ms. Nelson, you can\u0027t do anything until you rescue your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can beat your fucking face in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will that accomplish? If you beat the directions out of me, I can guarantee they won\u0027t be accurate. Try to be realistic, Ms. Nelson, if you can. You and your flat-footed friend here can go and try to find Mr. Fitzroy, but you\u0027ll have to leave me out of it.\" Not even in words would she trace the path to the lab again. \"But just to show there\u0027s no hard feelings, I\u0027ll let you in on a nonsecret. There\u0027s a way into the old building from the north end of the underground parking lot. Security\u0027s supposed to have video cameras down there, but they ran out of money. Don\u0027t say I never gave you anything. Happy trails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci took hold of Vicki\u0027s shoulder and pulled her gently but inexorably away from the desk. \"And what will you be doing while we\u0027re searching?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same thing I was doing when you showed up.\" Dr. Burke bent and opened the bottom drawer of her desk, pulling out an unopened bottle of Scotch. \"Attempting to drink myself into a stupor. Thank God, I always keep a spare.\" It took three tries before the paper seal tore. \"I assure you, I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not, when at the very least you\u0027ll be facing a murder charge?\" Vicki asked, shaking free of Celluci\u0027s hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still on about your mother, aren\u0027t you?\" The doctor sighed and stared for a moment into the pale depths of the amber liquid before continuing. \"I lost interest in the game when Donald died.\" The bottle became a silver casket. She shuddered and raised her head, looking past Vicki\u0027s glasses, meeting her eyes. \"Essentially, and I beg your pardon, Ms. Nelson, if the word offends you, but it\u0027s the only one that fits, essentially, I just don\u0027t care any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she didn\u0027t. Even through her own grief and rage and confusion, Vicki could see that. \"Come on.\" Pulling her bag up onto her shoulder, she jerked her head toward the door. \"She\u0027s not going anywhere right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki took another look into Dr. Burke\u0027s eyes and recognized what she saw there. \"Yeah. I believe her.\" She paused at the door. \"One more thing; you may not care now but don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to use your knowledge of Henry as a bargaining chip later... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" Dr. Burke interrupted, both hands around the bottle to keep from spilling any of the Scotch as she refilled her mug, \"without an actual creature to run tests on, I can scream vampire until I\u0027m blue in the face and no one will believe a word I say. Grave robbing does not help to maintain credibility in the scientific community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention murdering one of your grad students,\" Celluci pointed out dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Burke snorted and raised the mug in a sarcastic salute. \"You\u0027d be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ.\" Celluci slammed the flat of his hand against the wall in frustration. \"This place is like a maze; hallways that don\u0027t go anywhere, classrooms that lead to hidden offices, labs that suddenly appear... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki played the powerful beam of her flashlight down the hall. With the one in four emergency lighting on in the old building, she could see well enough to keep from crashing into things but not well enough to identify the things she wasn\u0027t crashing into. Only the area starkly illuminated by her flashlight held any definition. It was like she was moving through the slides of a bizarre vacation, stepping into a scene just as it was replaced by the next. Her nerves were stretched so tightly she could almost hear them twang with every movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dead mother was walking around in this building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time she moved her circle of sight she wondered, Will this be the time I see her? And when all that showed was another empty room or bit of hall, she wondered, Is she standing in the darkness beside me? Under her jacket and sweater, her shirt clung to her sides, and she had to keep switching the flashlight from hand to hand to dry her palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t going to work.\" Her arm dropped to her side and the hall slid into darkness except for the puddle of illumination now spilling over her feet. \"The layout of this place defeats any kind of a systematic search. \"We\u0027ve got to use our heads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Granted,\" Celluci agreed. He tucked himself up against her left shoulder; close enough, he judged, for her to see his face. \"But we\u0027ve got a crazy woman who\u0027s run off with a vampire. That doesn\u0027t exactly lend itself to logical analysis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to.\" Adjusting her glasses, more for the comfort of a familiar action than from necessity, she gave half her mind over to searching the scant information they had for clues. The other half of her mind filtered the noises of an old building at night, listening for the approach of shuffling footsteps. Suddenly, she turned to squint up at Celluci. \"Dr. Burke said Henry was in a large metal box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she implied it was heavy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki almost smiled. \"Look at the floor, Celluci.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they bowed their heads and stared at the pale, institutional gray tile, dulled by the passage of thousands of feet. A number of nicks and impressions dimpled the surface with shadow and darker still were a half-dozen signatures of black rubber heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the box is as massive as Dr. Burke implied,\" Vicki said, raising her head and looking Celluci in the eyes, \"one way or another it\u0027ll have left its mark. Rubber wheels will scuff. Metal wheels will imprint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci nodded slowly. \"So we look for the tracks she left moving the box. It\u0027s still a big building... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but we know damn well she didn\u0027t take it up and down the stairs.\" Vicki raised her arm and shone the flashlight down the hall. \"The power\u0027s on, so the elevators must be working. We check just outside them on every floor for the marks and then backtrack from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn appreciative grin spread over Celluci\u0027s face. \"You know, that\u0027s practically brilliant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki snorted. \"Thanks. You needn\u0027t sound so surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor no reason other than that they had to start somewhere, they began working their way down from the eighth, and highest, floor. On three, they found what they were looking for, pressed not only into the tile but into the metal lip leading onto the elevator, were the marks of two pairs of wheels about four feet apart. Silently, they stepped out into the hall and let the door wheeze closed behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one appeared to investigate the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnwilling to risk the flashlight and a premature discovery, Vicki grabbed Celluci\u0027s shoulder and allowed him to lead her down the hall. To her surprise, moving in what was to her total darkness was less stressful than the peep show the flashlight had offered. Although she still listened for approaching footsteps, the accompanying tension had lessened. Or maybe, she conceded, her grip tightening slightly, it\u0027s just that now I have an anchor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the first intersection, even she could see the way they had to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harsh white of the fluorescent lights spilled out through the open door and across the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki felt Celluci\u0027s shoulder rise as he reached beneath his jacket and she heard the unmistakable sound of metal sliding free of leather. Up until this moment, she hadn\u0027t realized he\u0027d brought his gun. Considering the amount of trouble he could get into for using it, she couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d actually drawn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that just a tad American,\" she whispered, lips nearly touching his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew her back around the corner and bent his head to hers. \"What Dr. Burke neglected to mention,\" he said in a voice pitched to carry to her alone, \"was that there\u0027s something else wandering around in here besides a mad scientist and your uh... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother,\" Vicki interjected flatly. \"It\u0027s okay.\" Her feelings were irrelevant to the situation. And I\u0027ll just keep telling myself that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, something else killed that kid and we\u0027re not taking any more chances than we have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, if it\u0027s already dead, what good will shooting it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was grim as he answered. \"If it died once, it can die again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what am I supposed to use, strong language?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\" And under the bravado, fear. Not alone. Not in the dark. Not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made their way to the open door. Vicki released her hold on Celluci\u0027s shoulder at the edge of the light. \"Give it a five count.\" His breath lapped warm against the side of her face, then he darted across the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next five seconds were among the longest Vicki had ever spent as she closed her eyes, leaned her head back against the wall, and wondered if she\u0027d have the courage to look. On five, she swallowed hard, opened her eyes, and peered around and into the room, conscious of Celluci across the doorway mirroring her movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with lids slitted against the glare, it took a moment for her eyes to stop watering enough for her to focus. It was a lab. It had obviously been in use recently. It had just as obviously been abandoned. Eight years with the police had taught her to recognize the telltale mess left behind when suspects had cut and run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautiously, they moved away from the door, slowly turned, and simultaneously spotted the isolation box, humming in mechanical loneliness at the far end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki took two quick steps toward it, then stopped and forced her brain to function. \"If this is the original lab, we know Catherine moved Henry away... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Henry\u0027s not in that box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut neither of them believed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to know for sure.\" Somehow, without her being aware of it, Vicki\u0027s feet had moved her to within an arm\u0027s length of the box. All she had to do was reach out and lift the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and lift the lid. Oh, Momma, I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t. She despised herself for being a coward, but she couldn\u0027t stop the sudden cold sweat nor the weakness in her knees that threatened to drop her flat on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right.\" It wasn\u0027t all right, but those were the words to say, so Celluci said them as he came around her and put one hand on the latch. This, at least, he could do for her. \"You don\u0027t have to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, I do.\" She could be a passive observer, if only that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci searched her face, swore privately that someone would pay for the pain that kept forcing its way out through the cracks in the masks she wore, and lifted the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe release of tension was so great that Vicki swayed and would have fallen had Celluci not stepped back and grabbed her. She allowed herself a moment leaning on the strength of his arm, then shook herself free. From the beginning, she\u0027d declared she was going to find her mother. Why am I so relieved that we didn\u0027t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick purple incisions, tacked closed with coarse black thread, marked the naked body of the young Oriental male in an ugly \"y\" pattern. A collar of purple and green bruises circled the slender column of the throat. Plastic tubes ran into both elbows and the inner thigh. Across the forehead, partially covered by a thick fall of ebony hair, another incision appeared to have been stapled closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, both Vicki and Celluci had seen more corpses than they cared to remember. The young man in the box was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, his chest... it\u0027s... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo steps forward and she was close enough to reach over the side and gently touch her fingertips to the skin over the diaphragm. It was cold. And it rose and fell to the prompting of something that vibrated beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus... There\u0027s a motor.\" She withdrew her hand and scrubbed the fingers against her jacket. Raising her head, she caught Celluci making the sign of the cross. \"Dr. Burke never mentioned this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not quite.\" He shifted his gun to his right hand and slipped it back into the shoulder holster. It didn\u0027t look like he\u0027d be needing it right away. \"But something tells me we\u0027ve finally found Donald Li.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man\u0027s eyes snapped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki couldn\u0027t have moved had she wanted to. Nor could she look away when the dark eyes tracked from her to Celluci and back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle shifted behind the purple bruises on the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray-blue lips parted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill... me... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy Mary, Mother of God, he\u0027s alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the box, the dark eyes slid slowly back to Celluci. \"No... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? What the hell do you mean no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means he\u0027s not alive, Mike.\" Vicki could hear a part of herself screaming. She ignored it. \"He\u0027s like my mother.\" Hands splayed against the glass. Mouth moving soundlessly. \"He\u0027s dead. But he\u0027s trapped in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill... me... please... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers digging into the bend of Celluci\u0027s elbow, Vicki backed away, pulling him with her. She stopped when the high rim of stainless steel replaced Donald Li\u0027s face with her own. \"We have to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci continued to stare in the direction of the box. \"Do what?\" he demanded harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki fought the urge to turn and run, thankful Celluci seemed frozen to the spot because she didn\u0027t have the strength to stop them both. \"What he asks. We have to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s alive, killing him is murder. If he\u0027s dead... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead, Mike. He says himself he\u0027d dead. Can you walk away and leave him like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the shudder run down the length of his body and barely heard his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki, we\u0027re out of our depth here.\" This was the stuff of nightmares. Not demons or werewolves or mummies or a four-hundred-and-fifty-year-old romance writer, this. He\u0027d thought that thirteen years of police work had equipped him to deal with anything and that the events of the last year had covered everything else. He\u0027d been wrong. \"I can\u0027t... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Weighed down by horror, his voice hardly rose above a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we found him. Because we\u0027re all he has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a whole world out there. Let someone else deal with it. But when he turned and looked down into Vicki\u0027s face, he couldn\u0027t say it. He recognized the look of someone very nearly at the end of her resources, someone who\u0027d been hit too hard and too often, but he also recognized the determined set to her jaw. She couldn\u0027t walk away leaving Donald Li trapped in his prison of dead meat. He couldn\u0027t walk away and leave her. Although he had to force his mouth to form the words, he asked, \"How do we do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking slowly, if she lost control even a little she\u0027d lose it all-Vicki laid out what they knew. \"He\u0027s dead. We know it. He says so. But his... \" Twentieth-century attitudes added difficulty to expressing what was so terrifyingly clear. \"... his soul is trapped. Why? The only difference between this corpse and any other... \" Except my mother\u0027s. She felt herself begin to slide toward the edge. No! Don\u0027t think of that now. \"... is that someone has given it an artificial resemblance to life. That has to be why he\u0027s trapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we unhook his life support?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki. One of us has to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head and met his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, he nodded. \"Let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take long for them to unhook the tubes and hoses, training and practice shoehorning distance in between what had to been done and feelings about doing it. Neither of them touched the body any more than was absolutely necessary. When they\u0027d finished, although Donald Li said nothing, they saw him still staring up out of dead eyes and knew it hadn\u0027t been enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should\u0027ve known. The others are up and walking around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Vicki found the input jack hidden under a thick fringe of hair and traced the cable back to the computer. She squinted at Catherine\u0027s message on the screen and tried to keep her hands from shaking just long enough to work the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems to be loading programming into... \" There was only one place it could be loading programming. \"Okay. Odds are good that if programming can be loaded, it can also be erased.\" Wiping her palms on her thighs, she dropped into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you know what you\u0027re doing?\" Celluci asked, grateful for an excuse to walk away from the horror in the box. \"This setup\u0027s more complicated than the gear you\u0027ve got at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How complicated can it be?\" Vicki muttered, making a note of the destination file. \"It all comes down to ones and zeros. Besides,\" she added grimly, hitting the reset button, \"how could I possibly make it any worse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned the main menu. \"Mike, what does initialize mean to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to do with starting up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought.\" Under the list of things that could be initialized was the destination code the program had been downloading into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just told it to reinitialize Donald\u0027s brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that should wipe it clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I wiped my hard drive that way once.\" Shoving the chair back from the desk, Vicki stood and pushed at her glasses. \"Hopefully, it\u0027ll release him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it doesn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know.\" If it didn\u0027t work, they\u0027d have to leave him there and hope that as the body slowly decayed so would whatever held him to it. To know you\u0027re dead. To watch your body rot. To have that be your only hope... . She clamped down hard on the hysteria she could feel rising. Later, she told it. Later, when Henry\u0027s safe and my mother\u0027s... my mother is...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci\u0027s voice cut through the thought. \"No change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it a minute.\" One step at a time, she managed to return to the box and to Celluci\u0027s side. If he hadn\u0027t gone back before her, she didn\u0027t think she could\u0027ve made it. With her arm pressed up against the warm resilience of his, she looked down at Donald Li\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark eyes caught her gaze and held it. Wrung dry, Vicki didn\u0027t even attempt to pull away. Suddenly, she realized that as all encompassing as her terror and revulsion might be it was nothing next to the terror that shrieked from behind the eyes of Donald Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had nothing to be afraid of in comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the fear faded, anger rose to take its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat sort of a person could do this to another human being?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, the dead man\u0027s eyes widened and just for an instant his expression changed to one of incredulous joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his face held no expression at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki released a breath she didn\u0027t remember holding. \"You see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any doubts that we did the right thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they reached up and pulled the lid closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone in the dark, Henry wondered how much of the night he had left. Surely he\u0027d endured a dozen hours or more since sunset. Why can\u0027t I feel the dawn? With the Hunger clawing for freedom and steel wrapped about him like a shroud, he yearned for oblivion even as he dreaded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d run through all the moments of Vicki he had. Unfair that a year slips through memory so fast. While some of what they\u0027d shared had added to the Hunger, most had helped to force it back. Vicki had given him her life, not just her body and blood. Had forged friendship out of circumstance. Had helped him when he needed it. Had come to him for help. Had trusted him. Been trusted in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassion. Friendship. Need. Trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, love. Considered in that light, he supposed it wasn\u0027t actually necessary for Vicki to say she loved him. Although it would have been good to hear... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to remember how many times he had heard the words. A hundred voices cried out; women\u0027s voices, men\u0027s voices, he quieted them all, searching the past for the glint of gold among the dross. A thousand nights slipped by, a hundred thousand, and out of all the shared passion and friendship and need there were only four, three women and a man, with whom there had also been trust enough for love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ginevra. Gustav. Sidonie. Beth.\" He murmured their names into the darkness. So many others he\u0027d let go of, forgotten, but those he still held. \"Only four in all those years... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo had been taken from him by violence, one by accident, one by time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel the melancholy gathering into a tangible presence, threatening to crush him under its weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki.\" A fifth name. A living name. \"And as they say... \" Although he knew it would do no good, Henry pressed his uninjured hand up against the lid as hard as exhaustion and pain allowed. \"... where there\u0027s life, there\u0027s hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuscles strained, the darkness developed a reddish hue, then the arm collapsed down across his chest and he was nearly deafened by the sound of his heart slamming up against his ribs. He had no idea what he\u0027d been trying to prove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last effort for the sake of love? He shifted slightly, changing his position as much as he could, the plastic padding beneath him tugging at the bare skin of his back. At least this time I won\u0027t be the one left behind to mourn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelancholy turned to despair and closed icy fingers around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be so easy to surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond, the son of a king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am Vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too tired. It just wasn\u0027t enough anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki wouldn\u0027t quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki won\u0027t quit. Not until she finds you. Find strength in that. Trust her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe will come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina had come. She had birthed him from the darkness, nourished him, guarded him, taught him, and finally let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to what your instincts tell you, Henry. Our nature says we hunt alone. This is your territory, I give it to you, and I will not stay to fight you for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then stay and share it with me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only smiled, a little sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced the length of the room and back to throw himself down on his knees at her feet. Even a short time before, he would have finished the motion by burying his head in her lap but now, in spite of the position, he was unable to close the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile grew sadder still. \"The bond of your creation is nearly broken. If I stay,\" she added softly, \"one of us will very soon drive the other away and that will wipe out even the memory of what we shared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of the Hunter growing louder in his head told him she spoke the truth. \"Then why,\" he cried, \"did you change me, knowing this would happen? Knowing we would have so little time together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbony brows drew down as she considered it. \"I think,\" she said slowly, \"I think I forgot for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice rose, echoing off the damp, stone walls of the abandoned tower. \"You forgot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Perhaps that is why we are able to continue as a race.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed his head, eyes squeezed shut, but his nature no longer allowed tears. \"It hurts. As though you cut my heart out and take it with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Her skirts whispered as she stood and he felt her fingers touch his hair in gentle benediction. \"Perhaps that is why we are so few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never saw her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that,\" he told the darkness as despair\u0027s grip tightened, \"is not helping.\" Surely there were pleasanter times to use as weapons against the knowledge that he was trapped, and alone... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. There have been prisons and prisoners before,\" he snarled. \"I can survive it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can survive the nights, despair whispered, but what of the days? So much blood has been taken. How much more will they take? How much more can you lose and still have a night to return to? What else will they do that you will be unable to prevent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLips drawn back from his teeth, Henry tried to twist away from the voice. It surrounded him, sounded within him, echoed against the metal that enclosed him. \"Vicki... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t know where you are. What if she doesn\u0027t find you in time? What if she doesn\u0027t come?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released his hold on the Hunger and let the Beast take him as it clawed its way free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all he had left to fight with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as these are working, we have no guarantee that she\u0027s going to leave Henry in one place.\" Vicki squinted in the brightly lit interior of the elevator and switched off her flashlight. \"She can keep rolling him around this building with us two steps behind like some kind of bad Marx Brothers movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we jam them?\" Celluci asked, stepping over the threshold and matching his companion\u0027s don\u0027t-fuck-with-me tone. That either of them was still functioning at all, he considered to be some sort of miracle. Let\u0027s hear it for the human animal\u0027s ability to cope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki shook her head and hit the button for the subbasement with enough force to nearly crack the plastic cover. \"Not good enough. The elevators are in opposite ends of the building. She can unjam them as fast as we can jam them. We\u0027re going to shut them off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By shutting off the power supply to the building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I repeat, how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki turned to stare at him through narrowed eyes. \"How the hell should I know? Do I look like an electrician? We\u0027ll find the electrical room and pull the plug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Metaphorically speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give me any of your fucking attitude, Celluci.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My attitude? Nelson, you\u0027ve got one hell of a nerve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nerve!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want attitude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir voice overlapped, the sound slamming up against the confining walls and crashing back. Words got tangled in the noise and were stripped of meaning. Toe to toe, they stood and screamed invective at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator reached the subbasement. Stopped. The door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... patronizing asshole!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe echoes changed. The words shot into the darkness and didn\u0027t come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey realized it together and together fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki was trembling so violently, she wasn\u0027t sure she could stand. Her legs felt like cooked pasta and there was a metal band wrapped so tightly around her throat that breathing hurt and swallowing was impossible. Her glasses had slid so far down her nose they were almost useless. She peered over them, through the tunnel the disease had pared her vision down to, and tried to focus on the face just inches from her own. Her hand came up to push them back into place but instead continued moving until it brushed the curl of hair off Celluci\u0027s forehead. She heard him sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he raised his arm and, with one finger against the bridge, slid her glasses back into place. \"We okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was warm against her cheek. She nodded jerkily and stepped back, out of the range of that comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the tracks?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe switched on her flashlight and walked out into the subbasement, a little amazed her legs would obey even such basic commands. \"We look for tracks after we immobilize Catherine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci paused for a moment on the threshold of the elevator, his presence preventing the door from closing. \"We turn off the power to the building,\" he said, \"and we\u0027ll turn off any other experiments she might be running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stopped and half turned to face him. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the raw anger that spit the word out. Recognized it because he felt it himself. It had nothing to do with the contest in vitriol they\u0027d held in the elevator, that had been nothing more than tension given voice, and everything to do with the horror they\u0027d found in the lab. He wanted to find whoever had been responsible, take them by the throat and... Words didn\u0027t exist for what he wanted to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last week, layer after layer of Vicki\u0027s control, of her protection, had been stripped away. He was afraid there was nothing left to keep her anger from being acted on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was afraid that if they found Henry the way they\u0027d found Donald Li, she\u0027d go right over the edge and he wouldn\u0027t be able to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was more afraid that he wouldn\u0027t even try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the second floor, in a utility cupboard that shared a wall with the elevator shaft, Marjory Nelson worked the muscles of her face into the closest she could come to a frown.
