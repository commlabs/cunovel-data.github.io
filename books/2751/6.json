{"id":83564,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Harvey?\" Julia asked abruptly. She picked up her cell phone and held it toward the windows as if there, in the middle of Manhattan, she might not have a signal. \"Has Harvey called you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want my credibility back, Candon. I want it back, and I want it back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know it\u0027s been damaged. Let\u0027s look at the numbers and see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what the numbers say.\" She stood and slammed the newspaper, photo up, onto the table in front of him. \"A picture\u0027s worth a thousand words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance\u0027s eyes were starting to adjust to the dark shades that he didn\u0027t dare take off. He\u0027d passed no fewer than ten newsstands, each one overflowing with pictures of him and a woman he barely knew. After the third person congratulated him on \"getting some of that,\" he\u0027d darted into a market and bought cheap sunglasses and a NY baseball cap. But even in the elevator alone, Lance couldn\u0027t remove his disguise. He didn\u0027t like the person he\u0027d become overnight. That morning, his grin was on every newsstand in America, but Lance didn\u0027t feel like smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator doors opened to reveal the usual purgatory outside the office of Poindexter-Stone. Eager actors lined the walls, so Lance pulled the cap lower and turned up the collar of his jacket and tried to bolt toward the door, hoping to fly by so quickly that none of his compatriots could aim and fire. He wasn\u0027t ten feet away from the elevator when he heard the first whoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There he is, the man of the hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Way to go, Lance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t forget the little people, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have a friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance should have had a smile and a comeback for each bit of locker-room banter, but all he could think of was reaching the door and strangling Richard Stone. He hurled himself into the office, slammed the door, and pressed his back against it as if trying to stem the tide of \"atta boy\" that flowed from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTammy must have called in sick, or quit, because she wasn\u0027t there. If not for the calendar on the wall, Lance might have sworn it had been twenty years since he\u0027d last set foot in that room. Everything looked a little bit different and a little bit the same, especially the woman who was on the phone, reading Tammy\u0027s magazine, looking exactly like the receptionist\u0027s future self. Unlike Tammy, this woman bolted to her feet at the sight of Lance, sliding her office chair back so quickly that it rolled into the table behind her and knocked over a stack of foam cups and left a pot of thick coffee sloshing like toxic sludge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" she stuttered. \"It\u0027s you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance quickly glanced at her left hand. No ring. This woman was single and, he guessed, a Julia James disciple. How, he wondered, were women taking the news that their crown princess was off the market, thanks to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased toward the woman and took his cap off, for politeness\u0027 sake. The sunglasses, however, he kept on. \"Is Richard here?\" he asked, not quite recognizing his own voice, as if he\u0027d somehow put a disguise on that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he? Where\u0027s my golden boy?\" Richard Stone virtually leapt into view like a Broadway extra—the only thing missing was the jazz hands. \"Come here, you beautiful boy. Is this kid photogenic or what?\" He pulled a tall stack of newspapers from her desk, and holding one toward Future Tammy, he asked, \"I mean, can this kid take a picture? Look at those teeth. What do we have here—braces, caps?\" He stepped toward Lance and tried to look in his mouth like a trainer inspecting a Thoroughbred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to you,\" Lance said, slapping Richard\u0027s hands away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Richard said, oblivious to the tension in Lance\u0027s voice. \"Gotta strike while the iron is hot. Glad to see you get it.\" He stepped toward the filing cabinets and the hallway behind them. \"Babe,\" he said to Future Tammy. \"Hold my calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Stone\u0027s office was surprisingly clean. If it had been two days earlier, Lance would have taken that as a sign of professionalism, and he would have ignored the mayhem of the hall and the lobby. He would have convinced himself that his career was going somewhere. But in the last twenty-four hours, he had developed the perspective he needed to see Richard and his office for what they really were—sparse and empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a load off.\" Richard walked behind an enormous desk and sat down. But Lance didn\u0027t take the seat in front of him. He didn\u0027t move at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your legs broke?\" Richard asked, impatience creeping into his voice. \"Sit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance stayed standing. \"Whatever you started yesterday, you need to find a way to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" Richard asked, jerking his head like he\u0027d had water in his ears and hadn\u0027t heard correctly. \"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re lies. Take them back,\" Lance said, growing stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take them back? I hate to break it to you, Romeo, but this isn\u0027t second grade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a nice woman,\" Lance shot back. \"We shared a cab and bought some toys, and now she\u0027s suing my ass!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard stood, but with his small stature, standing behind the enormous desk made him appear even less powerful. \"Are you growing a conscience on me?\" he cried. \"It\u0027s a tuna-fish world, and I\u0027m offering you filet mignon, and you\u0027re growing a conscience?\" He held up a stack of movie scripts and shuffled through them like a deck of cards, flashing the cover sheets as if asking Lance to pick a card, any card. \"You see the names on these? You see the parts I have for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roles and projects that passed before Lance\u0027s eyes were, in a word, legitimate. Not B-level films or infomercials. Far better actors had started with far less. It would take one, just one . . . Lance felt himself reach for a script, but then he snapped back into the moment. \"It\u0027s over. No deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t even know her,\" Richard cajoled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah,\" Lance snapped. \"That\u0027s kind of the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is America. Land of the tabloid. Home of E! Entertainment Television. There\u0027s no such thing as bad publicity! She owes you. You\"—Richard pointed a Vienna sausage-shaped finger at Lance—\"owe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lance turned to leave, Richard yelled out, \"I can get you a baked potato to go with that steak.\" Lance took another step. \"You\u0027re doing her a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance wheeled and yelled, \"You don\u0027t even know her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith eyebrows raised in the ultimate portrayal of irony, Richard said, \"Neither do you.\" He sank back onto the throne of Poindexter-Stone and continued. \"A buddy of mine in the book business just called. Her stuff is flying off the shelves, single-day sales records all over the place. Rumor has it they\u0027re gonna ink a seven-figure deal this afternoon. All because of our little project.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, believe it,\" the little man said. \"Thanks to you, she\u0027s Cinderella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temperature had dropped, and the weather forecasters predicted that a late-spring snowstorm could blow in overnight. But when Julia wrapped a scarf around her head, it was as much to keep hidden as to keep warm. She pulled her hands into the hot-pink mittens Cassie had given her for Christmas, so when her cell phone rang, she had to struggle to flip the tiny device open and say hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia?\" the soft voice asked, and she almost couldn\u0027t make out her own name amid the noises of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her hands cupped around her ears, she replied, \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia, dear, it\u0027s Francesca.\" Then a mental image popped into Julia\u0027s mind to match the voice on the phone. Harvey\u0027s Francesca, the delicate, beautiful woman who had been her agent\u0027s world for more than forty years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia darted into an apartment building alcove, ignored the stares of the doorman, and listened closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear, I got your messages. ...\" \"Francesca, I\u0027ve got to talk to Harvey. Could you ...\" \"No.\" Her response jolted Julia. \"No, dear, that\u0027s why I\u0027m calling. Harvey\u0027s in the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHospital?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went to get the paper this morning and had a heart attack at the newsstand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock forced Julia against the wall. She leaned against the glass doors, not caring about the mitten print she was leaving on the pristine glass. \"Francesca\"—she stumbled for words— \"I\u0027m so sorry. Is he ...\" How do you ask a woman this about her husband? Julia wondered. \"Is he . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s resting. The doctors say that\u0027s what he needs after surgery. No visitors,\" she added quickly. \"By the way, dear, congratulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Francesca—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lovely picture. Harvey was clutching a copy when . . . the paramedics saved it for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen this is over, Julia thought, I\u0027m going to need a very good shrink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the street, Julia began a list of reasons she shouldn\u0027t walk in front of a bus. Harvey wasn\u0027t a young man. In a city full of walkers and joggers and yoga-ers, she\u0027d seen him break a sweat while heading to the bathroom. It was ridiculous to think that she had caused his heat attack. Then she rounded a corner and passed a newsstand, and her own heart nearly stopped beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone rang, and she opened it quickly, anxious for news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\" It was a voice she recognized immediately. Surely he wasn\u0027t calling her. Surely no one in their right mind had given Lance Collins her private number. \"Hello?\" he said. \"I was calling for Julia—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no way you are calling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped the phone shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the street in front of the Ritz, there were no reporters in sight, but Julia sensed them lurking like zits under the surface of her skin. She quickened her step almost to a jog, then she slowed instinctively. The last thing she needed was a picture of her running in pumps on the front page of the next day\u0027s papers, the headline: JULIA JAMES RUNS TO LOVE! or DON\u0027T HURRY LOVE! or STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE! The potential plays on words were endless. She wasn\u0027t about to give any pun-happy junior editor an easy gem to print in eighteen-point font.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it inside and to the elevator, and pushed the button. Button lights up; this is good, Julia thought. Elevator doors open, good. Turn left. Fumble with key. Not good—who created these cheap little plastic card things? Red light. What does the red light mean? She tried the card again. Another red light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door behind her opened and closed. A voice cried out, \"Oh, my goodness!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fan, Julia thought. Of all the times and all the places . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe plunged the card into its electronic lock once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard the news and I . . .\" The woman behind her struggled for words. \"It\u0027s just. . . you\u0027ve always meant so much to me and . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... new hope. Such an inspiration. I mean, if you can find love, then anyone can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey! Julia forgot about the lock momentarily. I think I\u0027m offended, she thought, suddenly feeling like the Quasimodo of the self-help section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she should begin a one-woman PR campaign in the hotel hallway, but at that moment, all she really wanted was to be on the other side of that door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but...\" she started, when, to her amazement, she felt the door handle turn, opening from the inside. Stunned, she turned and came face-to-face with Lance Collins. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-6.html","bookId":2751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM"}
