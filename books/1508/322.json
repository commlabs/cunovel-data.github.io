But Lin Ming’s eyes brightened. He had naturally chosen to kill these high-level vicious beasts, but was worried that they would be too scattered in the air, and it would be difficult to kill them. He hadn’t expected that Shi Linkai would manage to attract their attention, causing these third-level vicious beasts to gather together. This was the perfect opportunity to wipe them all out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“First Spear Team, support them!” Although Zhu Ping hoped very much that these fellows who ruined the taxes of Green Mulberry City every year would die, at this time, he had to rely on them to defend the city.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Salt Clan masters had originally been with the javelin throwers and the archers, but now the archers had retreated, their spot was filled by a more dense, spear wielding military group. Such a change was not easy. The garrison army of Green Mulberry City wasn’t an elite unit, so their formations and movements were a bit messy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ho!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Blood Crow howled. Its strength was equal to a late Pulse Condensation period martial artist, and it wanted to directly tear a hole through the layers of troops. However, just as it picked up some spear wielding soldiers and was about to fly back into the sky, hundreds and thousands of azure light beams shot forwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese azure light beams converged on a single target, sinking directly into the Blood Crow’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a muffled sound, the Blood Crow trembled, and then blood spurted out from its head. It tumbled down from the sky, but because it was too fast and the inertia from falling a hundred feet was too great, a pile of soldiers on the ground were knocked away. The other soldiers lifted their spears to stab the vicious beast, but found that both of the Blood Crow’s eyes had already exploded, and chunks of internal organs were spewing forth from its beak. It was long dead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe truth was, in that moment when the azure true essence had struck it, its internal organs had all been instantly torn apart by the power of vibration.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s… it’s dead?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe soldiers couldn’t even react before they heard sharp whistling sounds in the air.

A moment ago, these vicious beasts had been savage killing monsters. But after they were struck by an azure light ray of true essence, they tumbled down like broken kites, their entire bodies twitching and bleeding from every hole, dead beyond dead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just a few breaths of time, 11 of the 13 third-level vicious beasts had died, and the two leftover weren’t in great shape either. The survivors turned around to fly away. Naturally, Lin Ming wouldn’t give them any hope of leaving alive. He flicked his fingers and two rays of azure true essence ran them down. With two light sounds, the two vicious beasts in the air fell to the earth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFinally, after the two vicious beasts smashed the ground, they had become puddles of crushed meat. One fell into the group of Salt Clan masters, and the other fell within a phalanx of long spear soldiers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the people looked at these two third-level beasts that had died such a pitifully horrific death, almost no one could believe it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey all died… like this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrom start to finish, Lin Ming hadn’t even used his spear. He merely flicked out ray after ray of strange azure light beams, and every strange light beam would instantly kill a third-level vicious beast in a simple and ruthless fashion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ka!

These vicious beasts were only the vanguard. Once the vicious beasts on land made their way here, the true war would begin. At that time, when these flying beasts returned, it would cause a great deal of trouble. Now that they were defeated and retreating, it was best to kill as many as possible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lin Ming’s awe-inspiring performance, his words had unwittingly become like a military order to the soldiers. All of the javelin throwers and archers were stunned for a moment, and then immediately reacted, firing as fast as they could.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming also began to flick out more rays of vibrating azure true essence, aiming towards the strongest second-level vicious beasts. As for the first-level vicious beasts, he basically ignored them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe rays of vibrating azure true essence were Lin Ming’s most effortless attack method. Before the real battle began, Lin Ming wanted to save up every bit of energy he could; every attack he sent out contained just the right amount of force to be lethal. He was well aware that in a protracted battle, he had to conserve his strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!

Of the several hundred flying vicious beasts that had come, only a few dozen had managed to escape.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the man in the bamboo hat saw dozens of flying vicious beats fall from the air because of Lin Ming, and the rest also fleeing, he gulped, his voice trembling as he said, “Boss… you… what you said was right. Even if you add Second Big Brother and Third Big Brother together, you aren’t a match for that boy. Is… is he really a middle Pulse Condensation martial artist?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShi Linkai’s throat twitched, and he ruefully smiled. Let alone three of them, even a dozen of them together wouldn’t be able to do anything. As long as those azure beams of light came towards them, they would die without a doubt!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat was that azure true essence attack?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey were all Pulse Condensation period martial artists right?

Everyone hadn’t even had time to catch their breath, when suddenly horrifying roars and hisses sounded out in the distance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Roar!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Roar!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe land-borne vicious beasts had finally attacked!

Tens of thousands of vicious beasts rampaged forwards, wild and savage. This scene was both terrifying and spectacular, the whole earth trembled!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe vicious beasts that were at the front were packs of Corrupt Wolves. A Corrupt Wolf was a second-level vicious beast, and its strength was equal to an Altering Muscle stage martial artist. They were similar to rabid dogs as they rushed forwards, their tongues out, white fangs exposed, green eyes filled with a crazy killing and bloodthirsty intent. These were vicious beasts that desired to tear into the bodies of their enemies!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Corrupt Wolf was a vicious beast that only existed in the Southern Wilderness. After Lin Ming had left the Sorcerer Holy Land, he seen that two Corrupt Wolves had almost taken the Na Sisters’ lives. They ate the corpses of dead creatures all year long, and their claws were steeped in corpse poison. After being caught by one, it was very easy to die from the following poison.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis poison had an antidote.

The long spear soldiers fitted into the gaps of the shield soldiers, thrusting out their spears through the gaps of the tower shields.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuddenly, the entire formation of soldiers became a charging line of defense with a forest of spears. The momentum of this charge was no weaker than the tens of thousands of vicious beasts!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the power of an army. No matter how strong Lin Ming was, it was impossible for a lone person to block the entire beast tide from reaching Green Mulberry City. But, if 10,000 soldiers created a great wall forged of flesh and steel, it was possible!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Awoo! Awoo! Awooo! Ao! Ao!

They were buried by the beasts behind them that were running at full speed. As a Corrupt Wolf fell to the ground, it was easy for it to cause other Corrupt Wolves to also stumble. As a result, a massive number of Corrupt Wolves were trampled to death within the raging stampede!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of time constraints, the garrison army of Green Mulberry City hadn’t been able to ready too many animal traps.

As they were rushing forwards at such a high speed, the sharpened logs pierced through their entire body from head to tail, instantly kill them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng peng peng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the sharpened logs was the last line of defense. A massive number of Corrupt Wolves slammed onto heavy shields, and some soldiers that could not withstand the impact were sent flying backwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Spear formation!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e1000 long spear soldiers thrust forth their spears from between the slits of the tower shields, stabbing into the soft bellies of the Corrupt Wolves, blood splattering everywhere, organs bursting out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the soldiers were individually weaker than the Corrupt Wolves by far, with the coordination of a battle formation and equipment, they could display a total strength that was far more formidable than their individual strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shook his spear and rushed out of the army camp. Closely following behind him were the masters of the Salt Clan. The other masters of the prominent families didn’t back down.
