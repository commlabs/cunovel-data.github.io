IN THE RUE DU CHERCHE-MIDI.","content":"\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;“Il ne faut jamais se laisser trop voir, même à ceux qui nous aiment.” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not very definitely known what Mademoiselle Brun taught in the School of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in the Rue du Cherche-Midi in Paris. For it is to be feared that Mademoiselle Brun knew nothing except the world; and it is precisely that form of knowledge which is least cultivated in a convent school.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “She has had a romance,” whispered her bright-eyed charges, and lapsed into suppressed giggles at the mere mention of such a word in connection with a little woman dressed in rusty black, with thin grey hair, a thin grey face, and a yellow neck.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It would seem, however, that there is a point where even a mother-superior must come down, as it were, into the market-place and meet the world. That point is where the convent purse rattles thinly and the mother-superior must face hunger. It had, in fact, been intimated to the conductors of the School of the Sisterhood of the Sacred Heart by the ladies of the quarter of St. Germain, that the convent teaching taught too little of one world and too much of another. And the mother-superior, being a sensible woman, agreed to engage a certain number of teachers from the outer world. Mademoiselle Brun was vaguely entitled an instructress, while Mademoiselle Denise Lange bore the proud title of mathematical mistress.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mademoiselle Brun, with her compressed mouth, her wrinkled face, and her cold hazel eyes, accepted the situation, as we have to accept most situations in this world, merely because there is no choice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What can you teach?” asked the soft-eyed mother-superior.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Anything,” replied Mademoiselle Brun, with a direct gaze, which somehow cowed the nun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “She has had a romance,” whispered some wag of fourteen, when Mademoiselle Brun first appeared in the schoolroom; and that became the accepted legend regarding her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What are you saying of me?” she asked one day, when her rather sudden appearance caused silence at a moment when silence was not compulsory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That you once had a romance, mademoiselle,” answered some daring girl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And perhaps the dusky wrinkles lapsed into gentler lines, for some one had the audacity to touch mademoiselle\u0027s hand with a birdlike tap of one finger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you must tell it to us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For there were no nuns present, and mademoiselle was suspected of having a fine contempt for the most stringent of the convent laws.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But why not, mademoiselle?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because the real romances are never told,” replied Mademoiselle Brun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But that was only her way, perhaps, of concealing the fact that there was nothing to tell. She spoke in a low voice, for her class shared the long schoolroom this afternoon with the mathematical class. The room did not lend itself to description, for it had bare walls and two long windows looking down disconsolately upon a courtyard, where a grey cat sunned herself in the daytime and bewailed her lot at night. Who, indeed, would be a convent cat?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the far end of the long room Mademoiselle Denise Lange was superintending, with an earnest face, the studies of five young ladies. It was only necessary to look at the respective heads of the pupils to conclude that these young persons were engaged in mathematical problems, for there is nothing so discomposing to the hair as arithmetic. Mademoiselle Lange herself seemed no more capable of steering a course through a double equation than her pupils, for she was young and pretty, with laughing lips and fair hair, now somewhat ruffled by her calculations. When, however, she looked up, it might have been perceived that her glance was clear and penetrating.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was no more popular person in the Convent of the Sacred Heart than Denise Lange, and in no walk of life is personal attractiveness so much appreciated as in a girls\u0027 school. It is only later in life that ces demoiselles begin to find that their neighbour\u0027s beauty is but skin-deep. The nuns—“fond fools,” Mademoiselle Brun called them—concluded that because Denise was pretty she must be good. The girls loved Denise with a wild and exceedingly ephemeral affection, because she was little more than a girl herself, and was, like themselves, liable to moments of deep arithmetical despondency. Mademoiselle Brun admitted that she was fond of Denise because she was her second cousin, and that was all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When worldly mammas, essentially of the second empire, who perhaps had doubts respecting a purely conventional education, made inquiries on this subject, the mother-superior, feeling very wicked and worldly, usually made mention of the mathematical mistress, Denise Lange, daughter of the great and good general who was killed at Solferino. And no other word of identification was needed. For some keen-witted artist had painted a great salon picture of, not a young paladin, but a fat old soldier, eighteen stone, on his huge charger, with shaking red cheeks and blazing eyes, standing in his stirrups, bursting out of his tight tunic, and roaring to his enfants to follow him to their death.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was after the battle of Solferino that Mademoiselle Brun had come into Denise Lange\u0027s life, taking her from her convent school to live in a dull little apartment in the Rue des Saints Pères, educating her, dressing her, caring for her with a grim affection which never wasted itself in words. How she pinched and saved, and taught herself that she might teach others; how she triumphantly made both ends meet,—are secrets which, like Mademoiselle Brun\u0027s romance, she would not tell. For French women are not only cleverer and more capable than French men, but they are cleverer and more capable than any other women in the world. History, moreover, will prove this; for nearly all the great women that the world has seen have been produced by France.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Denise and Mademoiselle Brun still lived in the dull little apartment in the Rue des Saints Pères—that narrow street which runs southward from the Quai Voltaire to the Boulevard St. Germain, where the cheap frame-makers, the artists\u0027 colourmen, and the dealers in old prints have their shops. To the convent school, the old woman and the young girl, walking daily through the streets to their work, brought with them that breath of worldliness which the advance of civilization seemed to render desirable to the curriculum of a girls\u0027 school.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It must be heavenly, mademoiselle, to walk in the streets quite alone,” said one of Mademoiselle Brun\u0027s pupils to her one day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is,” was the reply; “especially near the gutter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But this afternoon there was no conversation, for the literature class knew that Mademoiselle Brun was in a contrary humour.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “She is looking at that dear Denise with discontented eyes. She is in a shocking temper,” had been the whispered warning from mouth to mouth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in truth Mademoiselle Brun constantly glanced down the length of the schoolroom to where Denise was sitting. But a seeing eye could well perceive that it was not with Denise, but with the schoolroom, that the little old woman was discontented. Perhaps she had at times a cruel thought that the Rue des Saints Pères, emphasized as it were by the Rue du Cherche-Midi, was hardly gay for a young life. Perhaps the soft touch of spring that was in the March air stirred up restless longings in the soul of this little grey town-mouse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And while she was watching Denise, the cross-grained old nun who acted as concierge to this quiet house came into the room, and handed Denise a long blue envelope.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is addressed in a man\u0027s handwriting,” she said warningly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then let us by all means send for the tongs,” answered Denise, taking the letter with a mock air of alarm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But she looked at it curiously, and glanced towards Mademoiselle Brun before she opened it. It was, perhaps, characteristic of the little old schoolmistress to show no interest whatever. And yet to her it probably seemed an age before Denise came towards her, carrying the letter in her outstretched hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At first,” said the girl, “I thought it was a joke—a trick of one of the girls. But it is serious enough. It is a romance inside a blue envelope—that is all.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She gave a joyous laugh, and threw the letter down on Mademoiselle Brun\u0027s knees.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is my father\u0027s cousin, Mattei Perucca, who has died suddenly, and has left me an estate in Corsica,” she continued, impatiently opening the letter, which Mademoiselle Brun fingered with pessimistic distrust. “See here! that is the address of my estate in Corsica, where I shall invite you to stay with me—I, who stand before you in my old black alpaca, and would borrow a hairpin if you can spare it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her hands were busy with her hair as she spoke; and she seemed to touch life and its entanglements as lightly. Mademoiselle Brun, however, read the letter very gravely. For she was a wise old Frenchwoman, who knew that it is only bad news which may safely be accepted as true.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The letter, which was accompanied by an enclosure, was from a Marseilles solicitor, and began by inquiring as to the identity of Mademoiselle Denise Lange, instructress at the convent school in the Rue du Cherche-Midi, with the daughter of the late General Lange, who met his death on the field of Solferino. It then proceeded to explain that Denise Lange had inherited the property known as the Perucca property, in the commune of Calvi, in the Island of Corsica. Followed a schedule of the said property, which included the historic chateau, known as the Casa Perucca. The solicitor concluded with a word for himself, after the manner of his kind, and clearly demonstrated that no other lawyer was so capable as he to arrange the affairs of Mademoiselle Denise Lange.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jean Jacques Moreau,” read Mademoiselle Brun, with some scorn, the signature of the Marseilles notary. “An imbecile, your Jean Jacques—an imbecile, like his great and mischievous namesake. He does not say of what malady your second cousin died, or what income the property will yield—if any.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But we can ask him those particulars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And pay for each answer,” retorted Mademoiselle Brun, folding the letter reflectively.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was remembering that a few minutes earlier she had been thinking that their present existence was too narrow for Denise; and now, in the twinkling of an eye, life seemed to be opening out and spreading with a rapidity which only the thoughts of youth could follow and the energy of spring keep pace with.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then we will go to Marseilles and ask the questions ourselves, and then he cannot charge for each answer, for I know he could never keep count.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Mademoiselle Brun only looked grave, and would not rise to Denise\u0027s lighter humour. It almost seemed, indeed, as if she were afraid—she who had never known fear through all the years of pinch and struggle, who had faced a world that had no use for her, that would not buy the poor services she had to sell. For to know the worst is always a relief, and to exchange it for something better is like exchanging an old coat for a new one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And in the mean time—” said Mademoiselle Brun, turning sharply upon her pupils, who had taken the opportunity of abandoning French literature.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In the mean time,” said Denise, turning reluctantly away—“in the mean time, I am filling a vat of so many cubic metres, from a well so many metres deep, with a pail containing four litres, and of course the pail has a leak in it, and the well becomes deeper as one draws from it, and the Casa Perucca is, I suppose, a dream.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She went back to her work, and in a few moments was quite absorbed in it. And it was Mademoiselle Brun who could not settle to her French literature, nor compose her thoughts at all. For change is the natural desire of youth, and the belief that it must be for the better, part and parcel of the astounding optimism of that state of life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A few minutes later Denise remembered the enclosure—a letter in a thick white envelope, which was still lying on her desk. She opened it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “MADEMOISELLE” (the letter ran),\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I have the pleasure of addressing the daughter of an old comrade-in-arms, and this must be my excuse for at once approaching my object. I hear by accident that you have inherited from the late Mattei Perucca his small property near Olmeta in Corsica. I knew Mattei Perucca, and the property you inherit is not unknown to one who has had official dealings with landowners in Corsica. I tell you frankly that it would be impossible, in the present disturbed state of the island, for you to live at Olmeta, and I ask you as frankly whether you are disposed to sell me your small estate. I have long cherished the scheme of buying a small parcel of land in Corsica for the purpose of showing the natives that agriculture may be made profitable in so fertile an island, by dint of industry and a firm and unswerving honesty. The Perucca property would suit my purpose. You may be doing a good action in handing over your tenants to one who understands the Corsican nature. I, in addition to relieving the monotony of my present exile at Bastia, may perhaps be inaugurating a happier state of affairs in this most unfortunate country.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Awaiting your answer, I am, mademoiselle,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your obedient servant,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “LOUIS GILBERT (Colonel).”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The school bell rang as Denise finished reading the letter. The class was over.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall descend into the well again to-morrow,” she said, closing her books.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The girls trooped out into the forlorn courtyard, leaving Mademoiselle Brun and Denise alone in the schoolroom. Mademoiselle Brun read the second letter with a silent concentration. She glanced up when she had finished it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course you will sell,” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Denise was looking out of the tall closed windows at the few yards of sky that were visible above the roofs. Some fleecy clouds were speeding across the clear ether.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” she answered slowly; “I think I shall go to Corsica. Tell me,” she added, after a pause—“I suppose I have Corsican blood in my veins?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose so,” admitted Mademoiselle Brun, reluctantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2874/79515.html","bookId":1164,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:36:58 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:36:58 AM"}
