But if he manages to persuade more villagers to help clean the house, you will have to forgive him, Win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin\u0027s blue eyes twinkled. She spoke to Amelia, while her gaze remained on Merripen. \"I have every faith in his powers of persuasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing from anyone else, the words might have been construed as a piece of flirtation. But Amelia was fairly certain that Win had no awareness of Merripen as a man. To her he was a kindly older brother, nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feelings on Merripen\u0027s side, however, were more ambiguous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn inquisitive gray jackdaw flapped to the ground with a few tchacks, and made a tentative hop in Win\u0027s direction. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she told the bird, \"there\u0027s no food to share.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice entered the conversation. \"Yes there is!\" It was Beatrix, carrying a breakfast tray containing a plate of toast and a mug of tea. Her curly dark hair had been pulled back into an untidy bunch, and she wore a white pinafore over her berry-colored dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pinafore was too young a style for a girl of fifteen, Amelia thought. Beatrix was now at an age when she should be wearing her skirts to the floor. And a corset, heaven help her. But in the past year of turmoil, Amelia hadn\u0027t given much thought to her youngest sister\u0027s attire. She needed to take Beatrix and Poppy to a dressmaker, and have some new frocks made for them. Adding that to the long list of expenditures in her head, Amelia frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s your breakfast, Win,\" Beatrix said, settling the tray on her lap. \"Are you feeling well enough to butter the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoast yourself, or shall I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, thank you.\" Win moved her feet and gestured for Beatrix to sit at the other end of the chaise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrix obeyed promptly. \"I\u0027m going to read to you while you sit out here,\" she informed Win, reaching into one of the huge pockets of her pinafore. She withdrew a little book and dangled it tantalizingly. \"This book was given to me by Philomena Parsons, my best friend in the entire world. She says it\u0027s a terrifying story filled with crimes and horrors and vengeful phantoms. Doesn\u0027t it sound lovely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 thought your best friend in the world was Edwina Huddersneld,\" Win said with a questioning lilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, that was weeks ago. Edwina and I don\u0027t even speak now.\" Snuggling comfortably in her corner, Beatrix gave her older sister a perplexed glance. \"Win? You have the oddest look on your face. Is something the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin had frozen in the act of lifting a teacup to her lips, her blue eyes round with alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing her sister\u0027s gaze, Amelia saw a small reptilian creature slithering up Beatrix\u0027s shoulder. A sharp cry escaped her lips, and she moved forward with her hands raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrix glanced at her shoulder. \"Oh, drat. You\u0027re supposed to stay in my pocket.\" She plucked the wriggling object from her shoulder and stroked him gently. \"A spotted sand lizard,\" she said. \"Isn\u0027t he adorable? I found him in my room last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia lowered her hands and stared dumbly at her youngest sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve made a pet of him?\" Win asked weakly. \"Beatrix, dear, don\u0027t you think he would be happier in the forest where he belongs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrix looked indignant. \"With all those predators? Spot wouldn\u0027t last a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia found her voice. \"He won\u0027t last a minute with me, either. Get rid of him, Bea, or I\u0027m going to flatten him with the nearest heavy object I can find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would murder my pet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One doesn\u0027t murder lizards, Bea. One exterminates them.\" Exasperated, Amelia turned to Merripen. \"Find some cleaning women in the village, Merripen. God knows how many other unwanted creatures are lurking in the house. Not counting Leo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen disappeared at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spot is the perfect pet,\" Beatrix argued. \"He doesn\u0027t bite, and he\u0027s already house-trained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I draw the line at pets with scales.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrix stared at her mutinously. \"The sand lizard is a native species of Hampshireâ€”which means Spot has more right to be here than we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nevertheless, we will not be cohabiting.\" Walking away before she said something she would regret later, Amelia wondered why, when there was so much to be done, Beatrix would be so troublesome. But a smile rose to her lips as she reflected that fifteen-year-old girls didn\u0027t choose to be troublesome. They simply were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting handfuls of her skirts to pull them away from her legs, Amelia bounded up the grand central staircase. Since they would not be receiving guests or paying calls, she had decided not to wear a corset that day. It was a wonderful feeling to breathe as deeply as she wished and move freely about the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with determination, she pounded on Leo\u0027s door. \u0027\"Wake up, slugabed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA string of foul words filtered through the heavy oak panels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Amelia went into Poppy\u0027s room. She pulled the curtains open, releasing clouds of dust that caused her to sneeze. \"Poppy, it\u0027s... achoo!... time to get out of bed.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-14.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
