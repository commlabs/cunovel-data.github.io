That has to be how he got in because I know I locked the door behind you when you came in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head like he couldn’t believe Forbes has gone so far. “That was a pretty daring move. I think you should probably turn on the alarm as a precaution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings suddenly felt much more serious and he saw the worried look on my face. “I don’t think he’ll be back.” He placed two fingers under my chin and lifted my face for me to look at him. “Don’t be scared. I’ll be here if he comes back and I won’t let him hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to relax because I was confident in Jessie’s ability to protect me and I reveled in how safe he made me feel. “Thank you. I don’t think I could stay here tonight without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to lighten my mood. “Are we going to paint our nails and talk about boys at this slumber party?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up, resting my arms over his shoulders. “Nope. I want to pick up where we were before we were interrupted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t look like he shared in my anxiousness to continue where we left off and my hope plunged to my feet. “Did I do something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you were doing it right and that’s the problem. Making out like that is completely different for a guy. Do you remember when I told you that if things got too heated, I might tell you I needed a minute and that meant I needed you to back down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, things got way too heated for me and I was about to tell you I needed a minute before I looked up and saw Forbes,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my face and pressed it against his chest because I was mortified I had teased him past the point of his limitations. “I’m sorry I was too aggressive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my face in his hands, forcing me to lift my face. ”It’s not your fault that you’re too sexy for your own good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t keep from smiling because I was thrilled to hear him call me sexy. “Aha! There it is-that smile I love so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his hand and pulled him toward the sofa. “Will you try watching a movie with me if I promise I won’t assault you this time? You can pick since you’re staying to babysit me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opted to finish the movie we started earlier because he clearly wanted to make me happy and it gave me another reason to be crazy about him. How could I not love a guy that would voluntarily inflict a chick flick on himself for me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was apprehensive about initiating physical contact with Jessie again, but he put his arm around me and pulled me close, so it felt right when I laid my head against him and rested my hand on his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how long it had been since I dosed off, but I couldn’t recall much of the movie when I woke. My neck was stiff from being cocked to the side for so long and I moved it slowly because it felt like it had a crick caught in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Sleeping Beauty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched my neck a little more and hoped his arm didn’t feel the way my neck did. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep on you. Is there even a remote possibility that you have a little circulation in your arm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My arm is fine and I can’t complain because I had so much fun hearing the things you said while you slept. You have some fairly interesting ideas about me,” he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the heat rush to my face. “Don’t tell me what I said because I don’t want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good call,” he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my eyes shut and tried to remember what I was dreaming about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m pulling your leg, Princess. You didn’t say anything. You might have sighed a little, but it was completely innocent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was relieved, but I slapped him hard on the leg. “I’ll get you back for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no doubt you will, but it was so worth it to see your cheeks light up like that, which reminds me. What had you so lit up during dinner?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the heat remaining on my cheeks. “I was thinking about something I wanted to ask you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me. I want to hear what was so incredibly blush worthy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was quiet as he looked at me expectantly and I softly asked, “What am I to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fired back without hesitating, “What do you want to be to me?” It was a challenge for me to admit what my expectations were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked you first,” I said to dodge answering his question and I braced myself to hear the verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what you are to me.” Disappointment flooded me because it wasn’t what I had hoped to hear, then my hopes were lifted when he continued, “But, I know what I want you to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to say it so we’re both clear about it,” I encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since we’ve both admitted we’re in love with each other, there’s only one conclusion that makes sense to me. We’re a couple, so that makes you my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your girl? I like the sound of that. Hey, there’s a song about me called ‘Jessie’s girl.’ I still hear it on the radio occasionally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, everybody wishes they had Jessie’s girl,” he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started humming the melody and he asked, “By the way, in case you go back to sleep, do I need to be gone by a certain time in the morning to avoid your parents? I don’t think it will make a great impression if they find me here when they come home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They won’t be home until tomorrow afternoon, so you don’t have to leave early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was getting late. She saw me look at the clock and said, “It’s after one. Is it past your bedtime?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not normally, but I’m exhausted. I didn’t sleep much last night after a certain beautiful girl told me she loved me and then kissed me for hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched and said, “I’m pretty tired myself. A certain handsome guy with the most magnificent pale blue eyes kept me awake last night after he told me he loved me and kissed me for hours and hours and hours, so I’m ready to go to bed if you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood to go upstairs, but he didn’t get off of the sofa. “I think this couch will sleep better than my bed at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t intend on having him in my house alone all night long sleeping on an entirely different floor. “I want you to stay upstairs with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at him, hoping he would agree. “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t intend on giving up that easily.“I want to be close to you. I want to feel you laying next to me when I fall asleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for my hands. “Did he frighten you that much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s not that. I was just thinking we should take advantage of this opportunity. Who knows when we will have another chance to be this close to one another?” I asked with hope it would be enough to convince him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I agree to this, you can’t get me all revved up like you did earlier. No wrapping your legs around me or rubbing your body against me because a saint couldn’t have held back as well as I did. I make no guarantees if there is a next time,” he warned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be a good girl,” I said, but was uncertain if I would be able to keep my promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That naughty grin on your face has planted seeds of doubt in my mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled on his hands to get him off the sofa. “Come on. Nothing bad is going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he followed me upstairs, he used my brother’s bathroom to get ready for bed while I readied myself for bed in the bathroom inside my bedroom. After I brushed my teeth and washed my face, I put on a tank with matching boxer pajama bottoms. I opened the bathroom door and saw a shirtless Jessie standing at the foot of my bed wearing my brother’s knit pajama pants and I stopped dead in my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which side of the bed do you sleep on?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All sides, but I start out on the left side. I’m kind of a crazy sleeper. At least that’s what I’ve been told. You can give me your opinion in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I going to wake up in a headlock?” he laughed and it broke the tension a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t say it’s not a possibility, at least according to my family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began removing the throw pillows from my bed. “You might have mentioned that in the disclaimer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still would have agreed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood frozen by my bathroom door, not because I was scared of Jessie, but because I was in awe of his beautiful body. It begged me to touch it and I wondered what he would say if I went back on my promise to be a good girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, trying to clear those thoughts from it. “Did you find everything you needed in Ryan’s bathroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I didn’t make a move toward the bed, he looked concerned and questioned me. “Are you sure this is what you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him and nodded because I was speechless from the anticipation of sharing a bed with this beautiful man tonight. I walked to my side of the bed and we turned back the linens, then climbed in together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned onto my side and propped my head up to look at Jessie. My bedside lamp gave off a dim glow, but it was enough to allow me a good look at him. I studied his tattoo first because it was the first time I had seen it in it’s entirety. It extended further up his shoulder than I guessed and I reached out to trace the intricate detail with my fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled when I touched it and asked, “Why are you so fascinated by my tattoo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not fascinated. I just really like it a lot. I like what it says about you,” I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what does it say about me?” he asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my finger along one of the curves. “It says that you don’t care what anyone thinks. You’re living for you, not everyone else or what they want for you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-under-going-under-1/page-25.html","bookId":1877,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:10 PM"}
