Ice-cold outside, manic inside - or was it the other way around? Still numb from the death of her parents so long ago. Jaded by the world and by anything to do with boys...A princess in an icy tower...with a lust only for conquest, for power...until she\u0027d seenhim .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the world of the vampires...and Damon. And all the wicked wildness she\u0027d found inside herself, all the passion. Stefan was her lynchpin, but Damon was the fiery breath beneath her wings.
