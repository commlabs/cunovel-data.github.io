Collinbrae and Jackson. \u0026nbsp;There is absolutely no doubt whatever of your claim. \u0026nbsp;You will petition the Crown, and on reference to the House of Lords the Committee for Privileges will admit your right. \u0026nbsp;May I offer my congratulations, Lady de Lannoy on your acquisition? \u0026nbsp;By the way, I may say that all the estates of the Earldom, which have been from the first kept in strict entail, go with the title de Lannoy.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n During the recital Stephen was conscious of a sort of bitter comment on the tendencies of good fortune.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Too late! too late!’ something seemed to whisper, ‘what delight it would have been had Father inherited . . . If Harold had not gone . . . !’ \u0026nbsp;All the natural joy seemed to vanish, as bubbles break into empty air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To Aunt Laetitia the new title was a source of pride and joy, far greater than would have been the case had it come to herself. \u0026nbsp;She had for so many years longed for new honours for Stephen that she had almost come to regard them as a right whose coming should not be too long delayed. \u0026nbsp;Miss Rowly had never been to Lannoy; and, indeed, she knew personally nothing of the county Angleshire in which it was situated. \u0026nbsp;She was naturally anxious to see the new domain; but kept her feeling concealed during the months that elapsed until Stephen’s right had been conceded by the Committee for Privileges. \u0026nbsp;But after that her impatience became manifest to Stephen, who said one day in a teasing, caressing way, as was sometimes her wont:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Why, Auntie, what a hurry you are in! \u0026nbsp;Lannoy will keep, won’t it?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Oh, my dear,’ she replied, shaking her head, ‘I can understand your own reticence, for you don’t want to seem greedy and in a hurry about your new possessions. \u0026nbsp;But when people come to my age there’s no time to waste. \u0026nbsp;I feel I would not have complete material for happiness in the World-to-come, if there were not a remembrance of my darling in her new home!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen was much touched; she said impulsively:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘We shall go to-morrow, Auntie. \u0026nbsp;No! \u0026nbsp;Let us go to-day. \u0026nbsp;You shall not wait an hour that I can help!’ \u0026nbsp;She ran to the bell; but before her hand was on the cord the other said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Not yet! \u0026nbsp;Stephen dear. \u0026nbsp;It would flurry me to start all at once; to-morrow will be time enough. \u0026nbsp;And that will give you time to send word so that they will be prepared for your coming.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How often do we look for that to-morrow which never comes? \u0026nbsp;How often do we find that its looked-for rosy tints are none other than the gloom-laden grey of the present?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before the morrow’s sun was high in the heavens Stephen was hurriedly summoned to her aunt’s bedside. \u0026nbsp;She lay calm and peaceful; but one side of her face was alive and the other seemingly dead. \u0026nbsp;In the night a paralytic stroke had seized her. \u0026nbsp;The doctors said she might in time recover a little, but she would never be her old active self again. \u0026nbsp;She herself, with much painful effort, managed to convey to Stephen that she knew the end was near. \u0026nbsp;Stephen, knowing the wish of her heart and thinking that it might do her good to gratify her wish, asked if she should arrange that she be brought to Lannoy. \u0026nbsp;Feebly and slowly, word by word, she managed to convey her idea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Not now, dear one. \u0026nbsp;I shall see it all in time!—Soon! \u0026nbsp;And I shall understand and rejoice!’ \u0026nbsp;For a long time she lay still, holding with her right hand, which was not paralysed, the other’s hand. \u0026nbsp;Then she murmured:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘You will find happiness there!’ \u0026nbsp;She said no more; but seemed to sleep.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From that sleep she never woke, but faded slowly, softly away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen was broken-hearted. \u0026nbsp;Now, indeed, she felt alone and desolate. \u0026nbsp;All were gone. \u0026nbsp;Father, uncle, aunt!—And \u0026nbsp;Harold. \u0026nbsp;The kingdoms of the Earth which lay at her feet were of no account. \u0026nbsp;One hour of the dead or departed, any of them, back again were worth them all!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Normanstand was now too utterly lonely to be endurable; so Stephen determined to go, for a time at any rate, to Lannoy. \u0026nbsp;She was becoming accustomed to be called ‘my lady’ and ‘your ladyship,’ and the new loneness made her feel better prepared to take her place amongst new surroundings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In addition, there was another spur to her going. \u0026nbsp;Leonard Everard, knowing of her absolute loneliness, and feeling that in it was a possibility of renewing his old status, was beginning to make himself apparent. \u0026nbsp;He had learned by experience a certain wisdom, and did not put himself forward obtrusively. \u0026nbsp;But whenever they met he looked at her so meekly and so lovingly that it brought remembrances which came with blushes. \u0026nbsp;So, all at once, without giving time for the news to permeate through the neighbourhood, she took her way to Lannoy with a few servants.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen’s life had hitherto been spent inland. \u0026nbsp;She had of course now and again been for short periods to various places; but the wonder of the sea as a constant companion had been practically unknown to her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now at her new home its full splendour burst upon her; and so impressed itself upon her that new life seemed to open.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lannoy was on the north-eastern coast, the castle standing at the base of a wide promontory stretching far into the North Sea. \u0026nbsp;From the coast the land sloped upward to a great rolling ridge. \u0026nbsp;The outlook seaward was over a mighty expanse of green sward, dotted here and there with woods and isolated clumps of trees which grew fewer and smaller as the rigour of the northern sea was borne upon them by the easterly gales.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The coast was a wild and lonely one. \u0026nbsp;No habitation other than an isolated fisher’s cottage was to be seen between the little fishing-port at the northern curve away to the south, where beyond a waste of sandhills and strand another tiny fishing-village nestled under a high cliff, sheltering it from northerly wind. \u0026nbsp;For centuries the lords of Lannoy had kept their magnificent prospect to themselves; and though they had treated their farmers and cottagers well, none had ever been allowed to settle in the great park to seaward of the castle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the terrace of the castle only than one building, other than the cottage on the headland, could be seen. \u0026nbsp;Far off on the very crest of the ridge was the tower of an old windmill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3234/88509.html","bookId":683,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:30:08 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:30:08 AM"}
