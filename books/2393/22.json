Sitting in the bottom was a thick spiral-bound notebook. That was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma pulled it out and held it in her lap. There was nothing written on the front cover—no names or doodles, just a shiny piece of blue card stock. The wire spirals were perfectly coiled and even, without a hint of bending or rust. She turned to the first page. There was Sutton’s handwriting, round and neat and eerily similar to Emma’s own. January 10, she’d written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma sucked in her stomach. Did she really want to read her sister’s diary? When she lived in Carson City, she’d sneaked into a bedroom that belonged to Daria, a pretty, mysterious older foster sister who paid no attention to her. She’d read every page of Daria’s diary, which was mostly about boys and how she thought her legs and arms were too fat. Emma had also searched through the pockets of Daria’s jeans. She’d stolen a pair of headphones out of Daria’s room, purely because they were hers. She’d taken little things every time she went in after that: a rap CD, a black jelly bracelet, a department-store sample of Chanel No. 5. After she’d moved on to another home, Emma felt ashamed about what she’d done. She’d put all of Daria’s pilfered things in a manila envelope, wrote Daria’s name on the top, and sent them back to social services, vowing she’d never do something like that again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s nice that she was being all moral, but I just wanted her to read the damn diary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, as though she’d actually heard my thoughts, Emma looked down at the first page again and started to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach entry was short and sweet, more like quick Twitter entries and scattered thoughts. Sometimes Sutton wrote things like Elizabeth \u0026amp; James clogs or B-day party on Mount Lemmon? Sometimes she wrote exclamations like I hate history! or Mom can kiss my ass! The entries that seemed like they might be about something deeper were even more baffling though. C has been so bitchy lately, Sutton had penned on February 10. She just needs to get over it. On March 1: I had an unexpected visitor after school today. He’s such a cute little puppy dog, following me everywhere. On March 9: M outdid herself today. Sometimes I think C is right about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma leafed through the pages, trying to extrapolate meaning from the entries. There were a lot about L, who she could only assume was Laurel. L came downstairs this morning in an identical outfit to mine. And, Playing an awesome prank on L this afternoon. Maybe she’ll be sorry she wanted in so badly! And then on May 17, L is still ruined over T. Pull yourself together, bitch. He’s just a guy. Emma’s gaze landed on an entry from August 20, just a week and a half ago: If L brings up that night one more time, I’m going to kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat night? Emma wanted to yell. Why was Sutton so ridiculously vague? It was like she was keeping a journal for the CIA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just as frustrated as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a small construction-paper square fell out of the notebook and fluttered to the floor. Emma picked it up, gazed at the bold writing on the front, and gasped: THE LYING GAME MEMBERSHIP CARD. Below that was Sutton’s name, the title EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT AND DIVA, and then a date in May more than five years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the card was a list of rules:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Don’t tell ANYONE. Telling will be punishable by expulsion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Only three people allowed in the club at one time. (But someone had crossed out three and written four above it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Every new prank must be better than the last. Those who outdo one another earn a special badge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. If we’re really in trouble, if it’s not a prank, we will say the sacred code words: “Cross my heart, hope to die.” This means 9-1-1!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath that was a sub-list of pranks that were off-limits. It mostly contained things like hurting animals or little children, damaging stuff that was irreplaceable or really expensive (Charlotte’s dad’s Porsche was the example), or doing something that would have the government after them (someone had written a ha! after that). In different-colored blue ink at the very bottom, someone had added No more sexting, underlining it three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the membership card, too, my brain buzzing. I had a flash of Madeline, Charlotte, and me cutting out the cards and presenting them to one another ceremoniously, like we were receiving Oscar statuettes. But then, just like that, the memory was yanked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma read and reread the membership card several times over, feeling affirmed. At least she had a clear picture of what the Lying Game was now: Girl Scouts for psychopaths. She thought again about the snuff film. Perhaps it had started out as a prank, too. But maybe one of Sutton’s friends took it too far. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed the membership card aside and went back to the journal. On the very next page, she noticed an entry from August 22: Sometimes I think all my friends hate me. Every last one. Nothing more, nothing less. Below it Sutton had written down what looked like a Jamba Juice order: bananas, blueberries, Splenda, wheatgrass detox shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkaaay, Emma thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next page was full of drawings of girls in dresses and skirts, titled “ideal summer outfits.” Sutton’s last entry was on August 29, two days before Travis showed Emma the video. I feel like someone is watching me, she’d written in shaky, hurried handwriting. And I think I know who it is. Emma read the entry again and again, feeling like someone had reached into her heart and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrated hard, but nothing came to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma placed the journal on Sutton’s desk next to her computer. She moved the mouse on the sky blue pad, and the screen flickered to life. She opened Safari and clicked on Facebook. Sutton’s page loaded automatically. As Emma scrolled through the posts and notes, patterns began to emerge. In August, Sutton had written, I see you on Laurel’s Wall. In July, she’d told Madeline, You’re such a naughty spy. She wrote Charlotte a private message in June: You’re after me, aren’t you? She’d even written something similar on the Twitter Twins’ pages: Will you two stop plotting against me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’re you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma jumped and whirled around. Laurel leaned against the doorway, iPhone in her hand. Her blond hair was pulled up into a ponytail, and she’d changed into a pink terry beach cover-up and black flip-flops. Ray-Ban sunglasses obscured her eyes, but there was a broad smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just checking email,” Emma said in the airiest voice she could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe iPhone in Laurel’s hand bleeped, but she didn’t look at the screen. She kept her eyes fixed on Emma, turning a silver ring around her finger. Then her gaze fell to the open padlock on the bed. The journal in Emma’s lap. The Lying Game membership card on the desk. Emma’s heartbeat pulsed in her fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Laurel shrugged. “I’m going out to the pool if you want to join me.” She shut the door behind her as she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma opened to a page in Sutton’s journal again: Sometimes I think my friends hate me. Every last one. Emma gritted her teeth. Emma had never known her father. She’d been abandoned by her mother. And now her sister had been taken from her, too, before she’d ever had the chance to meet her. Emma wasn’t even sure she would have liked Sutton, but now she’d never know. And Sutton’s friends—or sister—weren’t going to get away with it. Not if she had anything to do with it. She was going to find out what they did to Sutton. She’d do whatever it took to prove they’d hurt her sister. She just had to get close enough to find out more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swiveled to the computer, clicked the mouse on Sutton’s Facebook status update window, and began to type: Game on, bitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree responses to the status pinged onto the screen almost immediately. The first comment was from Charlotte: A game? Do tell. I’m in! Then Madeline: Me too! And Laurel added: Me three! It’s a secret, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of, Emma typed in answer. Except now the prank was on them. And this time it was a matter of life and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNREQUITED SPYING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So where do you want to go for dinner?” Garrett asked Emma, guiding his Jeep Wrangler down a hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I don’t know.” Emma bit her pinkie. “Why don’t you pick somewhere?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett looked shocked. “Me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glassy, indecisive look swept across Garrett’s face. He reminded Emma of the malfunctioning Tickle Me Elmo doll she had inherited from an older girl her first year in foster care; sometimes the Elmo stared into space and didn’t know what to do next. “But we always go somewhere you like,” Garrett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma pressed her nails into her palm. If only she could just tell him she couldn’t pick a damn restaurant because she didn’t know any around here. Then she spotted a Trader Joe’s out the Jeep window. “Why don’t we buy some cheese and stuff and have a picnic on the mountain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great.” Garrett swerved across three lanes of traffic to get to the grocery store parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Saturday night just past 7 P.M., and the sun hung on the horizon. Garrett had shown up at the Mercers’ door a half hour earlier with a bouquet of flowers in his hands and a bouquet of different fragrances on his body—colognes, body sprays, hair gel, the works. There was such a hopeful, eager expression on his face that Emma couldn’t bring herself to call off the date, even though every cell in her body was dying to. She didn’t want to deal with Garrett right now; she wanted to be searching for Sutton’s killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter standing in line behind an old lady who insisted on paying with a check, Emma and Garrett finally arrived at Catalina State Park, a shopping bag full of sparkling cider, black olives, crackers, grapes, trail mix, fancy Australian licorice, and a wedge of Brie swinging from the crook of Garrett’s elbow. The air was cool and crisp and smelled like sunscreen. Other hikers bounded up the path. After another few twists and switchbacks, they reached the vista and settled on a big boulder. Emma could see all the way down the mountain. Garrett’s car looked like a toy from up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so nice out tonight,” Garrett murmured, running his hand through his blond hair. He removed his long-sleeved shirt and spread it on the ground as a picnic blanket. His tanned biceps bulged. He twisted the cider bottle open with a satisfying psst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh,” Emma replied. She stared blankly ahead. There were tumbleweeds in her mind where conversation topics should have been. What did Garrett and Sutton used to talk about? Did they have inside jokes? What brought them together? If only Sutton’s journal had been normal, Emma might’ve actually learned something useful like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, she pulled the crackers, olives, trail mix, and licorice out of the bag. She absentmindedly placed a cracker on the napkin and added two olives for eyes, a trail-mix peanut for a nose, and a piece of licorice for a smile. Thinking of Ethan, she poked Garrett. “Like my new friend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett glanced at it for a moment and nodded. “Cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to make a face, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett shrugged. “I can hardly draw a circle in art class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma popped one of the olive eyes into her mouth. So much for common ground. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lying-game-the-lying-game-1/page-22.html","bookId":2393,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:33 AM"}
