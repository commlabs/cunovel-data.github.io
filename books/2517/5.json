The more you take it, the more you gotta have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFair enough. I never took to it much anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they talk, the two men. The harlequin speaks mostly to himself – which is how, Moses guesses, he has kept his voice alive for so many years. Moses himself is simply the incident – an accidental audience for the man’s soliloquy. But there is something to admire in the harlequin’s speech. He employs big notions everywhere, a tinkerer of ideas as well as machines. The world to him is a world of toys. He must have been something back before everything happened. A genius of something – maybe a scientist or an artist or a philosopher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talk, and the terminal sleeps around them, and the harlequin’s hands are always moving. Moses lights a cigar and tells of the places he has been, the things he has seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world’s a wide place, he says. Wider than you think. Even tiny places have got wide histories. Do you believe it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh I believe it, says the harlequin, tapping his ear as though that is where his belief were contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Moses goes on to talk about his brother, Abraham, and the evil things he has done. The man goes on tinkering as Moses speaks, and Moses is grateful for not having to meet his eyes. And he is pleased to see that craft and creation can continue even in the hearing of such monstrous deeds. He is no good man himself, he explains to the little artisan hunched over the workbench, but he does believe in certain things: order and obligation, conduct and code. There has to be a logic to such things. There’s got to be. Because otherwise everything is a goddamn shambles – and the dead getting up and walking’ll be the least of it. Life comes and goes, and what it’s contingent upon is a mystery even to the wisest man – but order, that’s something else altogether. Maybe just a creation of man, but still and all maybe his most beautiful one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses explains to the harlequin that it is his contract – his duty – to protect his brother, but that it ain’t the world’s duty to do so. The world has been, Moses says, a pretty fair arbiter of things so far as he can tell. So how come it goes so light on Abraham Todd?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mind’s a puny machine, ain’t it? the harlequin says. Most of em are rust and fissure all through. What’s the oil that keeps em running smooth? Anyone’s guess. Some people think machines are built to follow expectation, that a machine not performing to expectation ain’t no machine at all. Me, I think different, ain’t I? Every machine its own miniature god circling its own miniature earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanin what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeaning, the harlequin says and turns on his stool to look Moses in the eye for the first time in the conversation, your code is your soul – don’t expect em all to look alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talk more, and the insomniac night wears on. You would think the world could get no emptier – but in the hours before dawn, you might as well be alone on the earth. Even over the palaver by the oil lamp, the two consorting figures are only accidental and temporary mates. They speak, truth be told, not to each other but to some haunted version of themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, Moses wakes his brother and tells him it’s time to go. They gather what ammo and supplies they can carry from the harlequin’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou tried to kill us, Moses explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve got a right to it, ain’t you? So take it. People abide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they take isn’t much, since they are accustomed to travelling light. When they have zipped up their satchels, the harlequin stands gazing at them with a sly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s what you took, and then there’s what you should of taken, he says. You overlooked the biggest prizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat prizes? Abraham asks petulantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething for each of you, the harlequin says and moves to the opposite side of the room where he shoves aside piles of blueprints and diagrams to reveal a massive metal chest. Moses recognizes it as a deep freeze, like a refrigerator toppled over onto its back – but since there is no electricity, the thing has become simple storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harlequin lifts the lid and shuffles around in the contents of the chest until he finds what he’s looking for. He tugs at it for a moment until he manages to pull it free with both hands. He has trouble lifting it, and as soon as it clears the edge of the chest, he lets it fall with a heavy clank to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMade it with my own hands, the harlequin says, but I weren’t mighty enough to lift it, were I? He’s a big one, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe indicates with a nod of the head that he is referring to Moses, so Moses goes and takes the object from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a brutal-looking weapon – a twisted and carnivalesque instrument of destruction. Constructed on the base of an iron pipe about the length of a great sword, there are blades welded on every which way. Dagger blades and hatchet blades. Kitchen-knife blades bent at spidery angles. There are blades all the way up and down the shaft of the iron pipe, but an increasing number towards the end, where a vicious iron spike protrudes from the tip. The grip is simple and inelegant – layers of duct tape wrapped around the base of the pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be used to swipe or cudgel or pierce. But any way it moves, Moses can tell, it will whistle sticky death through its path. He lifts it, feels the tremendous heft of it. A slow weapon, graceless and nasty. It’s not surprising that the harlequin cannot use it – Moses is barely able to hold it aloft comfortably with all the strength of both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he looks closely at it – the colours of the welded metal where the blades come together, the elemental blues and blacks and greens and browns. The distilling of metal into liquid and then the cohering of liquid into strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is an awesome ugliness to the thing, and Moses admires it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe does not thank the harlequin, for such a gift is beyond the formalities of words. Instead, he accepts it in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the little man is digging around again in the chest and comes up with a smaller object – a cigar box. He places the box on the workbench near by, lifts the lid and sifts through the objects until he finds what he’s looking for. This he hands to Abraham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it? Abraham asks. He holds the thing up to the light. Moses recognizes the object, dimly. He has never been one for computers, neither in the new world nor in the old, but this thing he recognizes as a something you plug into a computer port. It looks like nothing to speak of – a rectangle of plastic, smaller than a matchbox, with a sliver of metal poking out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s magic, ain’t it? the harlequin says in response to Abraham’s question. Here there ain’t no grid, no spark, no electric. So it ain’t no use to me. But find you a working machine to plug that doohickey into, and it’ll journey you whole new places, won’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-huh, Abraham says, unenthused. Hey, you don’t happen to have another of them killer swords, do you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis strikes the harlequin as funny, and he laughs his cackling laugh, shaking his head and waving his finger in the air as though to indicate that he needs a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiller swords, he says under his breath, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, buddy, Abraham says, slipping the plastic object into his pocket, you’re all right, you know that? What’s your proper name anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harlequin straightens up and puffs out his chest, announcing himself with military seriousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Albert Wilson Jacks, ain’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses observes the expression on his brother’s face collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbert? Abraham says. Albert? Your name’s Albert?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbert Wilson Jacks, the little man repeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guessed that name. Albert – that’s one of the goddamn names I guessed back there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it? says Albert Wilson Jacks with a bashful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt goddamn well is, Abraham confirms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a lesson to you, ain’t it? Justice and hearts – they’re naught but busted machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Moses and Abraham Todd leave Albert Wilson Jacks the harlequin there in his solitary fortress – and when they will think of him in the future, they will think of his hands that never stop tinkering and of his words that are spoken only to himself and to the myriad crevices of madness that mark any lost space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack outside in the desert sun they cross the vast runways between the rusted corpses of the massive airplanes. If technology has a life, and from what they’ve seen of the harlequin’s workshop the brothers believe now that it has, then this is a place of lost souls. A graveyard of machine corpses. Their stillness is a beautiful betrayal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrive at the car and climb in. They roll down the windows to release the hot air baked stale and stifling by the sun. But Moses does not turn the key in the ignition. He keeps his hands, unmoving, on the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it? Abraham asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are we goin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean? We’re goin west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat ain’t what I meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’d you mean then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean what are we doin just wanderin hither and thither across the globe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re surviving. We’re warrioring our way through life. We’re doin the best we can. Doin better than most if you ask me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ain’t enough, Moses says and looks grimly through the windshield. In front of them is a road that leads only two directions: the nowhere they came from and the nowhere they haven’t yet been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, what’re you lookin for then? Abraham asks his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know. How bout a direction? A destination. How bout a purpose? It ain’t quite livin without a purpose to shape the action. Even the slugs’ve got that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbraham considers for a moment. He is fifteen years Moses’ junior. An accidental birth given way to an accidental life. Five years old when everything went to hell, he only barely remembers the time before. He grew wrong somehow – Moses doesn’t know how. But the only thing he seems to respect in this world is his fraternal bond with Moses. And that’s worth something. It counts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, Abraham says finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, then, let’s find ourselves a purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite Dove of the Desert \" Acolytes \" A Saint and the Virgin Mary \" Ignatius \" Supper and Appetites \" A Measurement of Saints and Sinners while a Mission Sleeps \" Interlude \" The Canoness \" A Demonstration at a Grotto \" Where the Vestal Came From \" A Job of Work \" Treachery \" Escape \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/exit-kingdom-reapers-2/page-5.html","bookId":2517,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:22:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:22:34 PM"}
