How the Warrior-maid was won to be Gunther’s Bride","content":"\u0026nbsp;Now while thus they communed, their galley fled onward, and drew nigh \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To that seaward-fronting castle; and now did the King espy\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n High up at the open casements full many a maiden fair,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his spirit within him was troubled that he wist not who they were.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then of his comrade Siegfried straightway questioned he:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look upon yonder maidens, and say, be they known unto thee,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even they which be downward gazing o’er the sea as we draw anigh?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whosoe’er be their lord, of a surety is their bearing proud and high.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake the valiant Siegfried: “Look keenly and closely now\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the faces of yonder maidens, and then confess to me thou\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which wouldst thou take, were the choosing accorded to thee as of right.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yea, that will I,” answered Gunther, that keen and valiant knight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I mark, of all those fair ones, at yonder casement one;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is she in the snow-white raiment: like unto her is there none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She of mine eyes is the chosen: so sweet is her beauty’s pride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That, an I might have the decision, it is she that should be my bride.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By the sight of the eyes hast thou chosen, and a fair choice have they found!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even she is the noble Brunhild, of the beauty world-renowned,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 54}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Star of thine heart’s strong yearning, the choice of thy mind and thy will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n King Gunther gazed, and he deemed her ever sweeter and fairer still.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then that Daughter of Kings commanded that her winsome maidens should go\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the casements: she would not suffer that there they stand for a show\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a feast for the eyes of strangers. Was none dared disobey;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet that which they did thereafter is told in the ancient lay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They arrayed them in fairest adorning for the stranger knights to see—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As fair maids have done ever, since time began to be;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereafter through half-drawn curtains they peered, those dainty spies,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the heroes, to feed fair woman’s immemorial desire of the eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were four, and none other heroes which came unto that land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bold Siegfried led a war-steed from the galley’s side to the strand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the lovely ladies peering through the casements saw that thing,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they deemed that exceeding worship was rendered to the King.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There in their sight was he holding that gallant steed by the rein,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That stately battle-trampler, strong and of noble strain;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, he held it till King Gunther firm in the saddle sat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So served him Siegfried—service that thereafter he wholly forgat!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then brought he forth of the galley his own good steed withal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never ere then had he rendered the service done by a thrall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That he should stand by the stirrup while heroes mounted the selle!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And those fair ones from the casements that gazed saw all full well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the selfsame fashion accoutred were those princely heroes twain;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For white as snow were their horses, and their raiment white without stain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the one was, so was the other; and lovely the shield-rims shone\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the arms of the heroes hanging, flashing brightness like to the sun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gleaming with precious gemstones were saddle and breast-band strait.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So rode they in princely fashion before Brunhild’s palace-gate;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a chiming of bells all-golden that hung from their trappings was heard\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As they came into that far country by their princely hearts on-stirred.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 55}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With spear-head newly-whetted, with goodly-fashioned sword\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which hung even down to the spur-tips, on rode each kingly lord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, the glaives of the mighty-hearted were broad of blade and keen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And all was marked of Brunhild, that noble maiden-queen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with these two princes Dankwart and his brother Hagen came;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And these were arrayed, as telleth the tale of olden fame,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In raiment of raven blackness, with rich work broidered o’er.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n New, long and broad and goodly withal were the shields that they bore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the far land of India came many a precious stone\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the which up and down their vesture was a starry splendour thrown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their galley all unwarded they left, in the surf as it swayed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they rode to the castle-porchway, those heroes unafraid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They marked towers six and eighty that crowned that fortress-wall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Three palaces wide-builded, and a goodly feasting-hall:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was wrought of the lordly marble, as the lealand grass it was green;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And therein amidst of her people sat a child of kings, the Queen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bars clanged and bolts shot backward, the gates of the burg swung wide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forth running to meet the strangers the knights of Brunhild hied,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And received them as guests be welcomed, into their Lady’s land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they took in charge the war-steed, and received the shield from the hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a chamberlain bespake them: “Yield up your swords unto us,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And withal your gleaming hauberks.” “We will nowise suffer it thus;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ourselves be minded to bear them!” cried Hagen of Troneg the grim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Siegfried turned, and the manner of the kingdom set forth unto him:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In this burg is it ever the custom according to that I say,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the Queen’s guests go unweaponed within her courts alway.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hence from our hands let them bear them, so all shall be done aright.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grudging and loth was the yielding of Hagen, Gunther’s knight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They poured them the wine of welcome, they led them to chambers fair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Knights many swift in service in the halls of the palace there were\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That to and fro were hasting clad all in goodly array;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet, for all their splendour, their glances to those goodlier four would stray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 56}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now word is brought unto Brunhild, and the tale to her ears hath come\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of those unknown knights-errant which have fared to her island-home\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sailing over the sea-flood, and attired each man like a king.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the Maiden royal and lovely fell to questioning:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thus spake the Maid-queen Brunhild: “Now shall ye tell unto me\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who the unknown knights-errant may peradventure be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whom yonder I see in my castle, each man like a kingdom’s lord;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for love of whom these heroes have journeyed hitherward.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then of her train one answered: “I needs must own, O Queen,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That of yonder company no man heretofore have I seen;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet amidst them is one man standing who beareth Siegfried’s guise;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in loyal love I counsel, receive him in gracious wise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the second his comrade appeareth so worship-worthy to me,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That if haply he wield power royal, a king may he verily be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Over princely domains far-stretching, if he hold such sway indeed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For he stands mid the rest, meseemeth, as one of royal seed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the third of these faring-fellows, he seemeth stern of mien,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet none the less of stateliest stature, O mighty Queen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Swift, keen be his glances as lightning, and flash still to and fro:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dour and quick unto anger his spirit shall be, I trow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the youngest, of all praise worthy he seemeth in mine eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A gallant knight we account him, yet withal of such winsome guise\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the grace of a maiden shineth through all his mien high-born;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet verily might all tremble to deal to him scathe or scorn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For all his gentle bearing and his goodlihead withal,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet many a comely woman should weep for her lover’s fall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If his wrath to the battle were kindled: right sinewy-shapen is he,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In all manner of knightly virtues a flower of chivalry.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “Bring royal raiment to me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now if yon mighty Siegfried to my country be come oversea\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To seek my love in his wooing, he imperilleth his life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nowise I dread him so sorely as to stoop to be his wife!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 57}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Brunhild the passing lovely full soon was splendour-arrayed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And there in her train paced hallward many a winsome maid:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Five-score, nay more peradventure, all costly-vestured came:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to look on the guests with Brunhild went many a noble dame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To right and to left went marching strong thanes of Isenland,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Vassal-knights of Brunhild, each man with his sword in his hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Five hundred, yea more, it may be—for the guests an evil sight!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then rose from their seats at her coming the Four, those men of might.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now when that Daughter of Princes looked upon Siegfried’s face—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Would ye know of her greeting?—she bespake him with cold and stately grace:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now welcome be thou, O Siegfried, in thy coming to this my land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What meaneth this your journey?—prithee, cause me to understand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Exceeding thank do I render, O Daughter of Princes, to thee,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou deignest to greet me, Brunhild, Lady of Courtesy,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before this knight hath been greeted, who standeth before me in place,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For that he is my liege-lord:—Siegfried could well have foregone such grace!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He is the King of Rhineland—what need I say of him more?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All for thy love have we voyaged far overseas to thy shore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fixed is his heart to woo thee, whatsoever thereof betide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While yet there is time, bethink thee:—my lord turns never aside.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He hath to name King Gunther; wide is his royal domain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For thy love he comes hitherward wooing; nought else he desireth to gain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forasmuch as he hath commanded, on this journey have I too come.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If so be he were not my liege-lord, sooth, I had forborne therefrom.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She answered: “If thou be his vassal, and he thy suzerain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then must he abide the trial, the tests that I ever ordain.\n\u003c/div\u003e

Backward therefore the deadly point of the lance turned he;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then hurled he the spear butt-foremost full at the rings of her mail:\n\u003c/div\u003e

Amazon dame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Far thence from her hand that boulder with her uttermost might she swung,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then after the cast far leapt she, that her mail-rings clashed and rung.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twelve fathoms away from the caster crashed that stone to the ground;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But farther yet than the quoit-flight did the high-born maiden bound.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then strode that swift war-helper, Siegfried, where lay the stone:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Men saw but the arm of Gunther, the speeder thereof saw none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mighty of limb was Siegfried, valiant and tall was he;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Farther than Brunhild he hurled it, he leapt yet farther than she;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he added thereto a marvel, a deed of magic might,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That he bore in his leap King Gunther, by the power of the Hood of Night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, now is the great leap taken; behind on the earth lay the stone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gunther it was, the war-thane, whom men saw there alone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the face of Brunhild the lovely with helpless anger burned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Lo, Siegfried from King Gunther the imminent death hath turned!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then unto the host of her vassals Queen Brunhild looked, and she cried,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When she saw that hero standing safe on the lists’ far side:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “O ye my friends and liegemen, hitherward come straightway!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye be all unto this King Gunther vassals from this day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Down laid each valiant warrior his weapons from his hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And low at the feet they bowed them of the Lord of Burgundia-land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, unto Gunther the mighty bent many a valiant knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For they weened he had won that contest by his own unaided might.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With chivalrous grace and in loving wise he greeted the maid;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now that Queen of Beauty her hand in his hath laid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to him all rule she yielded over all her wide domain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then glad in his heart was Hagen, that bold and knightly thane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 64}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She besought that noble chieftain to her palace builded wide\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With her to return, and thither strode Gunther at her side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There all men fearing before him in homage lowly bent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the brethren, Dankwart and Hagen, thereat were well content.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Siegfried, the swift war-helper, in all deep craft was wise:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Back bare he the Hood of Darkness, and hid it from all men’s eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he passed to the hall, where fair ones sat in their bravery;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake unto King Gunther, and cunningly dealt he:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now why, Lord King, dost thou tarry, that the games not yet begin\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whereof this Queen made promise, and challenged thee herein?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let us now full soon behold them, and know of the trial’s stress.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —As nothing knowing of all things he spake in his wiliness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “How might this marvel befall\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou of the games, Lord Siegfried, hast witnessed nought at all,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherein was the victory given unto this King Gunther’s hand?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Out spake and answered Hagen, the knight of Burgundia-land:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thou, Queen,” he said, “didst trouble our spirit exceedingly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therefore was Siegfried the good knight abiding by ship and sea\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the hour when the Lord of Rhineland overcame in the wooer’s play;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So nought thereof he knoweth,” did Gunther’s liegeman say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now welcome to me be the tidings,” Siegfried the hero replied,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That here in such wise a wooer hath humbled thy tameless pride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And that some one lives to be master at last over thee and thine!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now shalt thou, noble maiden, fare with us to the Rhine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer that high-born Lady: “Not yet may this thing be,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere I have summoned my kinsmen and them of my vassalry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is all unmeet that so lightly I depart from this my land:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere then must my nearest and dearest be bidden from every hand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through the length and the breadth of her kingdom she made her messengers ride;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And all her friends and her vassals she gathered from every side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 65}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherefore in swift obedience unto Isenstein came they;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to each and to all of them gave she most royal-rich array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, day after day came riding from far, came early and late,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The best of the folk of Brunhild in throngs to her fortress-gate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Beshrew our folly,” cried Hagen, “in consenting to this thing!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To our own undoing await we Queen Brunhild’s following.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If these with all their war-might throng into this land thus—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Queen Brunhild’s secret purpose is all unknown unto us,—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What if she be wroth against us? Then were our plight forlorn:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So were the noble maiden for our utter discomfiture born!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then answered Siegfried the mighty: “This will I countervail.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So will I deal, that the purpose that disquieteth you shall fail.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Them that shall help I will bring you hitherward unto this shore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even chosen knights, such a war-host as ye have not seen heretofore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye shall ask not concerning mine absence: I will journey away from this place.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n God have your honour in keeping, and guard it safe for a space!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soon shall ye see me returning: a thousand men will I bring,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And these the mightiest war-thanes that ever followed king.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Only not long do thou linger,” the King made answer again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Forasmuch as we of thine helping be most exceeding fain.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said, “Ere ye see me returning of a truth shall the days be few:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And this shall ye tell Queen Brunhild, that hence I was sent of you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90334.html","bookId":422,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}
