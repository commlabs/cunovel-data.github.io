She flipped her battle rifle forward and stood in front of the door as the light on the airlock door flashed green. It slid open and Adriana walked through, wincing slightly as it then slid closed after her. There was always a sense of finality in leaving the safety of a base ship like this, a sense of stepping off the edge of a metaphorical cliff of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she was free-falling her way into a new situation, a new set of variables: whatever was on the other side of the large metal door in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, she liked the screaming flow of adrenaline coursing through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe liked the adrenaline rush even back when she\u0027d first showed up at the Spartan training grounds, staring with all the other kids at the instructors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t broken out with Jai because she wanted to escape. She\u0027d done it for the fun, that feeling of stepping off the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more dangerous, the more it felt like she was really someone. It beat the gray numbness of stillness, and sameness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world seemed to vibrate as Adriana watched the outer door open, her rifle up, her vision expanding into a sort of hunting state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst through into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia\u0027s airlock where nothing waited for her but benches and metal grating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed behind her, and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya disengaged with a loud thump as Mike cleared away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana waited until Mike had time to get well clear, then banged on the inner airlock door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt opened, and two gunshots cracked into the armor over her ribs. Adriana grunted and rolled through the crack in the door, firing back at the two men shooting at her. Always take the offensive, she thought. Don\u0027t get backed into a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dropping them she moved back into the airlock for a moment and checked her armor.

I\u0027m unarmed, now, please don\u0027t shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana moved her back against the corner and glanced at the gun. \"Who else is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonifacio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in an escape pod,\" the bodyguard said.

He looked up at her, hands up near his chest to show he was unarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" Adriana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sean. Wha...

A good-faith gesture that you\u0027re actually going to let me go. I get to that point and I tell you where the data is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think about it,\" Adriana replied, and toggled the mic off. \"Williams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Bonifacio make a copy?

She waited until he finally closed his eyes. Satisfied, she flicked the radio mic back on. \"Alright, Bonifacio, you cut loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike came on. \"Adriana, you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jai is about to storm that ship without us, Mike.

She felt along the top of the rim of the entrance delicately, and found the chip where he said it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled it free and looked at it. It wasn\u0027t much more than a tiny, stubby hardened wafer that sat in the palm of her hand. So much trouble over such a small thing, she thought as she slid it into a hip pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it?\" Mike asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think so.
