She flinched, tightening in place, a deer in headlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter had returned, hovering directly overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath waited above…as surely as it did below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18 Down the Rabbit Hole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDECEMBER 4, 11:02 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHISUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP AINTER LAY flat on the roof of the cinder-block building. He had bundled his cloak tightly under his legs, the ends of his scarf tucked away. He didn’t want any telltale flapping of material to reveal his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for the helicopter to make another pass over the town. He would get one shot. He had to assume the copter was outfitted with night vision. The muzzle flash would give away his position. He waited, the Galil sniping rifle at his cheek, resting on a bipod. The Israeli weapon, borrowed from one of the Rahim, had the capability to deliver a head shot at three hundred yards. But not in this storm, not with visibility so low. He needed the helicopter close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter lay in wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe copter was up there somewhere, searching. An aerial hunter hidden in the storm. Any movement, and it would open fire with its double guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter noted the glow deeper in the storm, in the direction of the ruins. The second helicopter. He prayed that Safia and Omaha had kept their heads down. He had tried to radio them earlier, when he first suspected the danger, but something blocked the signal. Perhaps interference from the static charge of the storm. He attempted to reach them on foot, but the helicopters had swooped in, targeting anything that moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there were birds in the air, then this was no small scouting party. Cassandra had somehow learned of her mistake and moved full forces in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio in his ear whispered with static, the channel left open. Words formed out of the white noise. “Commander.” It was Coral, reporting in from the field. “As you suspected, I’ve hostiles coming in on all sides. They’re doing a building-by-building search.” Painter touched his transmitter, trusting that the storm kept their words private. “The children and older women?” “Ready. Barak awaits your signal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter searched the skies. Where are you? He needed to take out the helicopter if they were to have any hope of breaking through the noose around the town. The plan was to strike out west of the ruins, collecting Safia and Omaha along the way, risking the wild weather. Though the storm was growing worse with every minute, it could cover their retreat. If they left the ruins behind, perhaps Cassandra would be satisfied enough to make only half an effort to hunt them down. If they could get back to the mountains…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter felt a fury build in him. He hated to retreat, to hand Cassandra a victory here. Especially with the discovery of the secret chamber under the sinkhole. Cassandra would surely bring in heavy excavating equipment. Something lay down there. The Rahim were living proof of something extraordinary. His only hope was to abscond with Safia, delaying Cassandra enough for him to alert someone in Washington, someone he could trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that certainly was not the command structure of Sigma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger built in him, stoking a fire in his gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been set up. All of them had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind flashed to Safia. He could still feel the beat of her heart under the blade he held at her throat. He had seen the look in her eyes afterward, as if he were a stranger. But what did she expect? This was his job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes hard choices had to be made, and even tougher actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Coral’s report of forces moving into the town’s outskirts, they would be surrounded in minutes. He could no longer wait for the helicopter to show itself. It would need to be flushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Novak, is the rabbit ready to run?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On your go, Commander.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rev it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter waited, cheek against the gun, one eye peering through the telescopic lens, the other on the skies. A bright light burst down in the town, shining from an open doorway. Details were murky, but through his night-vision goggles, the light shone brilliant. A throaty engine growled and whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let her run,” Painter ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rabbit’s loose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the building, a sand cycle burst forth. Its path was only evident as a brightness tearing down an alley between buildings. It zigzagged through the tangle of streets. Painter watched the skies to either side and above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it appeared, diving like a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter’s guns chattered, flashes in the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter adjusted his rifle, aimed for the source of the gunfire, and pulled the trigger. The recoil struck his shoulder like a mule kick. He didn’t wait. He squeezed off another three shots, ears ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw it, a flare of flame. A heartbeat later, an explosion lit the storm. Fiery wreckage spat in all directions, but the main bulk tumbled in a steep path. It struck a building, burst brighter, then crashed into the roadway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go,” Painter yelled into his radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldered the rifle and rolled off the roof’s lip. The soft sand cushioned his fall. All around, engines ignited with rumbles and coughing whines. Lights flared. Bikes and buggies burst forth from alleyways, lean-tos, and out of doorways. One bike sped past Painter. A woman leaned over the bars, another sat behind her, rifle on her shoulder. The women would sweep a path ahead, guard their rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the doorway, Kara appeared, carrying a girl in her arms. Others followed. Barak helped an old woman, followed by two others, supporting each other. Clay and Danny held children’s hands, one on each side. Not a whimper from the lot of them. Not even Clay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me,” Painter said, and set off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his rifle shouldered but held a pistol in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he rounded the corner of their shelter, a barrage of gunfire sounded from the ruins. Through the gloom, a floodlight flared. The second helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God…” Kara said behind him, knowing what the gunfire meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia and Omaha had been found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:12 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR UN!” OMAHA screamed as they ran across the floor of the sinkhole, but his words never reached his own ears. The rattle of guns was deafening. He pushed Safia ahead of him. They raced, blinded by the swirling sand, chased by a twin line of bullets chewing across the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly ahead rose the western cliff of the sinkhole, shadowed from above by the citadel’s ruins. The wall was lightly scalloped, coved in. If they could get under the lip of rock, out of direct line of fire, they’d have some shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia ran an arm’s length ahead of him, slightly encumbered by her sling, loping, the stiff winds tangling her cloak about her feet. Sand blinded. They hadn’t even had time to pull their goggles in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments ago, they had decided that the helicopter was the lesser of two evils. The powder keg building in the trilith chamber meant certain death. So they took their chances on the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chatter of guns grew louder as the helicopter swept behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reason they had survived this long was the sandstorm. The pilot fought to keep his craft trimmed in the winds. It buffeted and fluttered, a hummingbird in a gale, throwing off the pilot’s aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fled for shelter, running blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha waited for bullets to shred into him. With his last breath, he would push Safia to safety, if need be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullets suddenly stopped, as if the craft had run out of ammunition. The sudden silence drew Omaha’s attention over his shoulder, his ears still ringing. The helicopter’s floodlight angled away. The copter swept back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his attention turned, he stumbled over a rock, went down hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Omaha…!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia came back to help. He waved her off. “Get to shelter!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha hobbled after her, his ankle flaring with pain, twisted, sprained, hopefully not broken. He cursed his stupidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter retreated to the other side of the sinkhole. It had them dead to rights. They shouldn’t have made it. Why had it pulled back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:13 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eE AGLE ONE, don’t hit the goddamn target!” Cassandra screamed into the radio. She banged a fist on the armrest of her seat in the M4 armored tractor. On her laptop, she stared at the blue glowing ring of the curator’s transceiver. It had blinked into existence a moment ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gunfire had flushed Safia out into the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle One answered, the pilot’s voice choppy. “I’ve broke off. There are two of them. I can’t tell which one is the target.” Cassandra had radioed just in time. She pictured the pilot cutting down the woman. The curator was her best chance to quickly root out the secrets here and abscond with the prize. And the asinine pilot had almost mowed her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave them both,” she said. “Guard the hole they came out of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever cavern the curator had disappeared into had to be important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra leaned close to her laptop, watching the blue glow. Safia was still in the giant sinkhole. There was nowhere she could go that Cassandra could not find her. Even if the woman vanished into another cave, Cassandra would know where to find the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the tractor’s driver, John Kane. “Take us in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the engine still running, he shoved the gearshift. The tractor jerked, then trundled up the dune that hid them from the town of Shisur. Cassandra sat back, one hand on the laptop, holding it steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached the dune’s summit, the nose of the tractor rocked high, then fell down the far slope. The valley of Shisur lay ahead. But nothing could be seen beyond a few yards of the vehicle’s xenon headlights. The storm swallowed the rest away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll except a scatter of glows, marking the town. Vehicles on the move. A firefight between her forces and some unknown party still continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistantly, echoes of sporadic gunfire reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain of her forward forces had radioed in his assessment: They all appear to be women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no sense. Still, Cassandra remembered the woman she had chased through the back alleys of Muscat. The one who had vanished in front of her. Was there a connection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra shook her head. It no longer mattered. This was the endgame, and she would not tolerate anyone thwarting her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-71.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
