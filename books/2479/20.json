Here.\" Flint offered sixty dollars to her, and the woman accepted the cash with an age-spotted hand and then sniffed the wet bills. \"We\u0027ll need the paddle, too,\" he told her, and she laughed again as if this were a grand illusion and walked into her shack, the interior of which Flint could see was plastered with newspaper pages and held a cast-iron stove. Flint told Pelvis to help him get the motor unclamped from the boat\u0027s stem, and they were laying it on the platform when Rona returned-without her shotgunbringing a paddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" Pelvis said. \"We sure do \u0027predate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a question for you,\" Rona said as they were getting into the boat. \"Who sent you here?

Behind the football helmet\u0027s protective bar her deep-socketed eyes glinted with what was surely insanity but might also have been-at least for a passing moment-the memory of a teenaged girl in her finest dress, sitting in the third row of a Biloxi auditorium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worked one of the gaudy fake diamond rings from a finger and pushed it into her palm. \"Darlin\u0027,\" he said, \" you decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting in the stem, Flint untied the rope that @red the boat to the platform and then pushed them off with the paddle. Pelvis took the bow seat, Mama warm and drowsy against his chest. Flint began to stroke steadily toward the center of the channel, where he got them turned southward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the current grasp their hull, and in another moment they were moving at about the pace of a fast walk. When Pelvis looked back at the woman standing in front of her decrepit shack, Flint said acidly, \"Made yourself another fan there, didn\u0027t you, Mr. Presley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelvis stared straight ahead into the darkness. He pulled in a long breath and slowly released it, and he answered with some grit in his voice. \"You can pucker up and kiss my butt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome Sweet Hellhole In the starfire dark Dan and Arden drifted past other narrower bayous that branched off from the main channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw no other lights or shacks, and it was clear that their detour off the bridge had left LaPierre miles behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the mosquitoes found them, there was nothing they could do but take the bites. Something bumped hard against the boat before it swam away, and after his heart had descended from his throat, Dan figured it had been an amorous alligator looking for some scaly tush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got into a pattern of paddling for three or four minutes and then resting, and he and Arden both cupped their hands and bailed out the water that was seeping up through the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing about this to Arden, but he guessed the boat was a rusty nail or two from coming apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the pain had cleared from Arden\u0027s head. Her vision had stopped tunneling in and out, but her bones still ached and her fingers found a crusty patch of dried blood in her hair and a lump so sore the lightest pressure on it almost made her sick. Her purse and suitcase were gone, her money, her belongings, her identification, everything lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept her life, and the drawstring bag in her right hand. But that was okay, she thought. Maybe it was how things were supposed to be. She was shedding her old skin in preparation for the Bright Girl\u0027s touch. She was casting off the past, and getting ready for the new Arden Halliday to be born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow she would find the Bright Girl in this wilderness she didn\u0027t exactly know, but she had to believe she was close now, very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d seen the light in the shack\u0027s window back there, she\u0027d thought for a moment they might have found the Bright Girl, but she didn\u0027t think-or she didn\u0027t want to think-that the Bright Girl would choose to live in a tarpaper hovel. Arden hadn\u0027t considered what kind of dwelung the Bright Girl might occupy, but now she envisioned something like a green mansion hidden amid the \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"f6958f86b6\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e trees, where sunlight streamed through the high branches like liquid gold. Or a houseboat anchored in a clear, still pool somewhere up one of these bayous. But not a dirty tarpaper shack. No, that didn\u0027t suit her image of the Bright Girl, and she refused to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strained to see through the darkness, thinking-or wishing-that just ahead would be the glow of another lantern and a cluster of squatters\u0027 shacks, somebody to help her find her way. She glanced back at Dan as he slid the paddle into the water again. The man Godprovided, Jupiter had said. She\u0027d never have left the motel with Dan if she hadn\u0027t been clinging to Jupiters instincts about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJupiter had always been a mystic; he had the sixth sense about horses, he knew their temperaments and their secret no-es.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he said a docile-looking animal was getting ready to snort and kick, it was wise to move away from the hindquarters And he knew other things, too; if he smelled rain in the midst of a Texas drought, it was time to get out the buckets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read the sky and the wind and the pain in Arden\u0027s soul; she had come to realize during her years at the youth ranch that Jupiter Krenshaw was connected to the flowing currents of life ira a way she couldn\u0027t fathom. She had trusted and believed him, and now she had to trust and believe he\u0027d been telling her the truth about the Bright Girl, and that he\u0027d seen something in Dan Lambert that no one else could recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSho had to, because there was no turning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They drifted on, the skiff being drawn along with the slow but steady current. They passed evidence that others had come this way: a few abandoned and crumbling shacks, a wharf jutting out over the water on rotten pilings, a wrecked and vine 4mped shrimp boat whose prow was jammed between the trunks of two huge moss trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan felt meanness overtalang him, and he caught himself dozing off between stretches of paddling. Arden likewise had begun to close her eyes and rest, fighting thurst but not yet ready to drink any of the water they were gliding through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan let himself sleep for only a few minutes at a time, then his internal alarm went off and roused him to lmep the boat from drifting into the half-submerged trees on either side. The water was probably eight or ten feet deep, he figured. Their boat was still in the slow process of sinking, but he went to work bailing with his hands and Arden helped him until their craft had lightened up - \u0027 .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan noted that the branches overhead were g to unlock and draw apart. In another M\u003dty minutes or go-a little over an hour since they\u0027d set off in the boat-the bayou merged into a wider channel that took a long curve toward the southwest. Heat hotnmg shin2mered in the @, and an oomional fish jumped from the channel\u0027s ebony surface and sped down again. Dan looked at the water in the boat and decided it wasn\u0027t wise to think too much about what might be the depths, \u003dMng those fish want to grow wings. He paddled a few strokes and then rested again, the muscles of his back starting to cramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to paddle awhile?\" Arden asked \"No, I\u0027m all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"7b293b\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e the paddle across his knees, he let the current do the work.

Yes, he decided; a man could get lost in here and never be found. \"This ought to take us out to the Gulf, sooner or later,\" he said. \"Could be daylight before we get there, though.\" He made out ten forty-four by the luminous hands of his watch. \"Once we clear the swamp, maybe we can find a fishin\u0027camp or something\u0027along the coast.
