McKie with a whiff of lemon.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;For just an instant his mind played tricks on him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He thought he was on Tutalsee\u0027s gentle planetary ocean floating softly on his garlanded island.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There were lemons on his floating island, banks of Hibiscus and carpets of spicy Alyssum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His bowered cottage lay in the path of perfumed breezes and the lemon . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwareness came.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was not on Tutalsee with a loving companion; he was on a trained bedog in the armored efficiency of his Central Central apartment; he was back in the heart of the Bureau of Sabotage; he was back at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA planet full of people could die today . . . or tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would happen unless someone solved this Dosadi mystery.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Knowing the Gowachin as he did, McKie was convinced of it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Gowachin were capable of cruel decisions, especially where their species pride was at stake, or for reasons which other species might not understand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon, his Bureau chief, assessed this crisis the same way.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not since the Caleban problem had such enormity crossed the ConSentient horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where was this endangered planet, this Dosadi?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a night of sleep suppression, the briefings about Dosadi came back vividly as though part of his mind had remained at work sharpening the images.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Two operatives, one Wreave and one Laclac, had made the report.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The two were reliable and resourceful.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Their sources were excellent, although the information was sparse.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The two also were bucking for promotion at a time when Wreaves and Laclacs were hinting at discrimination against their species.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The report required special scrutiny.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No BuSab agent, regardless of species, was above some internal testing, a deception designed to weaken the Bureau and gain coup merits upon which to ride into the director\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, BuSab was still directed by Bildoon, a PanSpechi in Human form, the fourth member of his creche to carry that name.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It had been obvious from Bildoon\u0027s first words that he believed the report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKie, this thing could set Human and Gowachin at each others\u0027 throats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an understandable idiom, although in point of fact you would go for the Gowachin abdomen to carry out the same threat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie already had acquainted himself with the report and, from internal evidence to which his long association with the Gowachin made him sensitive, he shared Bildoon\u0027s assessment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Seating himself in a grey chairdog across the desk from the director in the rather small, windowless office Bildoon had lately preferred, McKie shifted the report from one hand to the other.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Presently, recognizing his own nervous mannerism, he put the report on the desk.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was on coded memowire which played to trained senses when passed through the fingers or across other sensitive appendages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why couldn\u0027t they pinpoint this Dosadi\u0027s location?\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s known only to a Caleban.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they\u0027ll . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Calebans refuse to respond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie stared across the desk at Bildoon.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The polished surface reflected a second image of the BuSab director, an inverted image to match the upright one.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie studied the reflection.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Until you focused on Bildoon\u0027s faceted eyes (how like an insect\u0027s eyes they were), this PanSpechi appeared much like a Human male with dark hair and pleasant round face.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Perhaps he\u0027d put on more than the form when his flesh had been molded to Human shape.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon\u0027s face displayed emotions which McKie read in Human terms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The director appeared angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie was troubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Refused?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Calebans don\u0027t deny that Dosadi exists or that it\u0027s threatened.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They refuse to discuss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re dealing with a Caleban contract and they\u0027re obeying the terms of that contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecalling that conversation with Bildoon as he awakened in his apartment, McKie lay quietly thinking.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was Dosadi some new extension of the Caleban Question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s right to fear what we don\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Caleban mystery had eluded ConSentient investigators for too long.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He thought of his recent conversation with Fannie Mae.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When you thought you had something pinned down, it slipped out of your grasp.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Before the Calebans\u0027 gift of jumpdoors, the ConSentiency had been a relatively slow and understandable federation of the known sentient species.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The universe had contained itself in a shared space of recognizable dimensions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The ConSentiency of those days had grown in a way likened to expanding bubbles.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It had been linear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleban jumpdoors had changed that with an explosive acceleration of every aspect of life.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jumpdoors had been an immediately disruptive tool of power.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They implied infinite usable dimensions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They implied many other things only faintly understood.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Through a jumpdoor you stepped from a room on Tutalsee into a hallway here on Central Central.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You walked through a jumpdoor here and found yourself in a garden on Paginui.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The intervening \"normal space\" might be measured in light years or parsecs, but the passage from one place to the other ignored such old concepts.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And to this day, ConSentient investigators did not understand how the jumpdoors worked.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Concepts such as \"relative space\" didn\u0027t explain the phenomenon; they only added to the mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie ground his teeth in frustration.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Calebans inevitably did that to him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What good did it do to think of the Calebans as visible stars in the space his body occupied?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He could look up from any planet where a jumpdoor deposited him and examine the night sky.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Visible stars:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ah, yes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Those are Calebans.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What did that tell him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a strongly defended theory that Calebans were but a more sophisticated aspect of the equally mysterious Taprisiots.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The ConSentiency had accepted and employed Taprisiots for thousands of standard years.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A Taprisiot presented sentient form and size.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They appeared to be short lengths of tree trunk cut off at top and bottom and with oddly protruding stub limbs.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When you touched them they were warm and resilient.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were fellow beings of the ConSentiency.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But just as the Calebans took your flesh across the parsecs, Taprisiots took your awareness across those same parsecs to merge you with another mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaprisiots were a communications device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut current theory said Taprisiots had been introduced to prepare the ConSentiency for Calebans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dangerous to think of Taprisiots as merely a convenient means of communication.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Equally dangerous to think of Calebans as \"transportation facilitators.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Look at the socially disruptive effect of jumpdoors!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And when you employed a Taprisiot, you had a constant reminder of danger:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the communications trance which reduced you to a twitching zombie while you made your call.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No . . . neither Calebans nor Taprisiots should be accepted without question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the possible exception of the PanSpechi, no other species knew the first thing about Caleban and Taprisiot phenomena beyond their economic and personal value.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were, indeed, valuable, a fact reflected in the prices often paid for jumpdoor and long-call services.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The PanSpechi denied that they could explain these things, but the PanSpechi were notoriously secretive.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were a species where each individual consisted of five bodies and only one dominant ego.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The four reserves lay somewhere in a hidden creche.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon had come from such a creche, accepting the communal ego from a creche-mate whose subsequent fate could only be imagined.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;PanSpechi refused to discuss internal creche matters except to admit what was obvious on the surface:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that they could grow a simulacrum body to mimic most of the known species in the ConSentiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie felt himself overcome by a momentary pang of xenophobia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe accept too damned many things on the explanations of people who could have good reasons for lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping his eyes closed, McKie sat up.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His bedog rippled gently against his buttocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlast and damn the Calebans!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Damn Fannie Mae!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d already called Fannie Mae, asking about Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The result had left him wondering if he really knew what Calebans meant by friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Information not permitted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of an answer was that?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Especially when it was the only response he could get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot permitted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic irritant was an old one:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;BuSab had no real way of applying its \"gentle ministrations\" to the Calebans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Calebans had never been known to lie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They appeared painfully, explicitly honest . . . as far as they could be understood.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But they obviously withheld information.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not permitted!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was it possible they\u0027d let themselves be accessories to the destruction of a planet and that planet\u0027s entire population?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie had to admit it was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey might do it out of ignorance or from some stricture of Caleban morality which the rest of the ConSentiency did not share or understand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Or for some other reason which defied translation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They said they looked upon all life as \"precious nodes of existence.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But hints at peculiar exceptions remained.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What was it Fannie Mae had once said?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dissolved well this node.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could you look at an individual life as a \"node\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf association with Calebans had taught him anything, it was that understanding between species was tenuous at best and trying to understand a Caleban could drive you insane.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In what medium did a node dissolve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, this Dosadi report from the Wreave and Laclac agents had to be accepted on its own limited terms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Powerful people in the Gowachin Confederacy had sequestered Humans and Gowachin on an unlisted planet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dosadi - location unknown, but the scene of unspecified experiments and tests on an imprisoned population.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This much the agents insisted was true.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If confirmed, it was a shameful act.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The frog people would know that, surely.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Rather than let their shame be exposed, they could carry out the threat which the two agents reported:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;blast the captive planet out of existence, the population and all of the incriminating evidence with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDosadi, a planet of thinking creatures - sentients.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If the Gowachin carried out their violent threat, a living world would be reduced to blazing gases and the hot plasma of atomic particles.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Somewhere, perhaps beyond the reach of other eyes, something would strike fire against the void.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The tragedy would require less than a standard second.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The most concise thought about such a catastrophe would require a longer time than the actual event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if it happened and the other ConSentient species received absolute proof that it had happened . . . ahhh, then the ConSentiency might well be shattered. Who would use a jumpdoor, suspecting that he might be shunted into some hideous experiment?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Who would trust a neighbor, if that neighbor\u0027s habits, language, and body were different from his own?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes . . . there would be more than Humans and Gowachin at each other\u0027s throats.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;These were things all the species feared.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon realized this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The threat to this mysterious Dosadi was a threat to all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie could not shake the terrible image from his mind:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an explosion, a bright blink stretching toward its own darkness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And if the ConSentiency learned of it . . . in that instant before their universe crumbled like a cliff dislodged in a lightning bolt, what excuses would be offered for the failure of reason to prevent such a thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReason?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie shook his head, opened his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was useless to dwell on the worst prospects.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He allowed the apartment\u0027s sleep gloom to invade his senses, absorbed the familiar presence of his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a Saboteur Extraordinary and I\u0027ve a job to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt helped to think of Dosadi that way.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Solutions to problems often depended upon the will to succeed, upon sharpened skills and multiple resources.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;BuSab owned those resources and those skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie stretched his arms high over his head, twisted his blocky torso.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The bedog rippled with pleasure at his movements.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He whistled softly and suffered the kindling of morning light as the apartment\u0027s window controls responded.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A yawn stretched his mouth.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He slid from the bedog and padded across to the window.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The view stretched away beneath a sky like stained blue paper.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He stared out across the spires and rooftops of Central Central.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Here lay the heart of the domine planet from which the Bureau of Sabotage spread its multifarious tentacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked at the brightness, took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bureau.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The omnipresent, omniscient, omnivorous Bureau.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The one source of unmonitored governmental violence remaining in the ConSentiency.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Here lay the norm against which sanity measured itself.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Each choice made here demanded utmost delicacy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Their common enemy was that never-ending sentient yearning for absolutes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And each hour of every waking workday, BuSab in all of its parts asked itself:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we if we succumb to unbridled violence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was there in deepest awareness:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we are useless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConSentient government worked because, no matter how they defined it, the participants believed in a common justice personally achievable.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Government worked because BuSab sat at its core like a terrible watchdog able to attack itself or any seat of power with a delicately balanced immunity.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Government worked because there were places where it could not act without being chopped off.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;An appeal to BuSab made the individual as powerful as the ConSentiency.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It all came down to the cynical, self-effacing behavior of the carefully chosen BuSab tentacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t feel much like a BuSab tentacle this morning, McKie thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his advancing years, he\u0027d often experienced such mornings.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had a personal way of dealing with this mood:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he buried himself in work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie turned, crossed to the baffle into his bath, where he turned his body over to the programmed ministrations of his morning toilet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The psyche-mirror on the bath\u0027s far wall reflected his body while it examined and adjusted to his internal conditions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His eyes told him he was still a squat, dark-skinned gnome of a Human with red hair, features so large they suggested an impossible kinship with the frog people of the Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The mirror did not reflect his mind, considered by many to be the sharpest legal device in the ConSentiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Daily Schedule began playing to McKie as he emerged from the bath.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The DS suited its tone to his movements and the combined analysis of his psychophysical condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, ser,\" it fluted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie, who could interpret the analysis of his mood from the DS tone, put down a flash of resentment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Of course he felt angry and concerned.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Who wouldn\u0027t under these circumstances?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, you dumb inanimate object,\" he growled.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He slipped into a supple armored pullover, dull green and with the outward appearance of cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe DS waited for his head to emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to be reminded, ser, that there is a full conference of the Bureau Directorate at nine local this morning, but the . .

thing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No matter how carefully you set them, they always got out of phase.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He didn\u0027t bother to bridle his mood, merely spoke the key words in full emotional spate:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Now you hear me, machine:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;don\u0027t you ever again choose that buddy-buddy conversational pattern when I\u0027m in this mood!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I want nothing less than a reminder of that conference.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When you list such a reminder, don\u0027t even suggest remotely that it\u0027s my

facility:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a Taprisiot monitor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d have his own Taprisiot link sitting safely here on CC while he went out and risked his vulnerable flesh.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Taprisiot served only one function:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to note his death and record every aspect of his final moments - every thought, every memory. This would be part of the next agent\u0027s briefing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the next agent would get his own Taprisiot monitor etcetera, etcetera, etcetera . . . BuSab was notorious for gnawing away at its problems.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Bureau never gave up.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But the astronomical cost of such a Taprisiot monitor left the operative so gifted with only one conclusion:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;odds were not in his favor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There\u0027d be no accolades, no cemetery rites for a dead hero . . . probably not even the physical substance of a hero for private grieving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie felt less and less heroic by the minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeroism was for fools and BuSab agents were not employed for their foolishness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He saw the reasoning, though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was the best qualified non-Gowachin for dealing with the Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He looked at the nearest DS voder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it suggested that someone doesn\u0027t want me at that conference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no such speculation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who gave you this message?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bildoon.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Verified voiceprint.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He asked that your sleep not be interrupted, that the message be given to you on awakening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he say he\u0027d call back or ask me to call him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Bildoon mention Dosadi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said the Dosadi problem is unchanged.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dosadi is not in my banks, ser.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Did you wish me to seek more info . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!
