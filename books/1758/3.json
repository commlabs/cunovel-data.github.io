And it was for this reason also that a native of Venus, not a man at all, but a small mind-reading and mind-influencing animal, accompanied them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hovered, now, a thousand miles above Jupiter Nine and waited as a flexible conveyer tube was made fast between the Shooting Starr and the commander\u0027s ship. The tube linked air lock to air lock and formed a passageway which men could use in going from one ship to the other without having to put on a space suit. The air of both ships mingled, and a man used to space, taking advantage of the absence of gravity, could shoot along the tube after a single initial push and guide himself along those places where the tube curved with the gentle adjusting force of a well-placed elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander\u0027s hands were the first part of him visible at the lock opening. They gripped the lip of the opening and pushed in such a way that the commander himself leapfrogged out and came down in the Shooting Starr\u0027s localized artificial gravity field (or pseudo-grav field, as it was usually termed) with scarcely a stagger. It was neatly done, and Bigman, who had high standards indeed for all forms of spacemen\u0027s techniques, nodded in approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good day, Councilman Starr,\" said Donahue gruffly. It was always a matter of difficulty whether to say \"good morning,\" \"good afternoon,\" or \"good evening\" in space, where, strictly speaking, there was neither morning, afternoon, nor evening. \"Good day\" was the neutral term usually adopted by spacemen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good day, Commander,\" said Lucky. \"Are there any difficulties concerning our landing on Jupiter Nine that account for this delay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Difficulties? Well, that\u0027s as you look at it.\" He looked about and sat down on one of the small pilot\u0027s stools. \u0027Tve been in touch with Council headquarters but they say I must treat with you directly, so I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Donahue was a wiry man, with an air of tension about him. His face was deeply lined, his hair grayish but showing signs of having once been brown. His hands had prominent blue veins along their backs, and he spoke in an explosive fashion, rapping out his phrases in a quick succession of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treat with me about what, sir?\" asked Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just this, Councilman. I want you to return to Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander did not look directly at Lucky as he spoke. \"We have a morale problem. Our men have been investigated and investigated and investigated. They\u0027ve all come through clear each time, and each time a new investigation is started. They don\u0027t like it and neither would you. They don\u0027t like being under continual suspicion. And I\u0027m completely on their side. Our Agrav ship is almost ready and this is not the time for my men to be disturbed. They talk of going on strike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said calmly, \"Your men may have been cleared but there is still leakage of information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonahue shrugged. \"Then it must come from elsewhere. It must...\" He broke off and a sudden incongruous note of friendliness entered his voice. \"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman followed his eyes and said at once, \"That\u0027s our V-frog, Commander, I\u0027m Bigman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander did not acknowledge the introduction. He approached the V-frog instead, staring into the enclosed water-filled cage. \"That\u0027s a Venus creature, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" said Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard of them. Never saw one, though. Cute little jigger, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky felt a grim amusement. He did not find it strange that in the midst of a most serious discussion the commander should veer off into an absorbed admiration for a small water creature from Venus. The V-frog itself made that inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small creature was looking back at Donahue now out of its black eyes, swaying on its extensible legs and clicking its parrot beak gently. In all the known universe its means of survival was unique. It had no defensive weapons, no armor of any sort. It had no claws or teeth or horns. Its beak might bite, but even that bite could do no harm to any creature larger than itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it multiplied freely along the weed-covered surface of the Venusian ocean, and none of the fierce predators of the ocean\u0027s deeps disturbed it, simply because the V-frog could control emotion. They instinctively caused all other forms of life to like them, to feel friendly toward them, to have no wish whatever to hurt them. So they survived. They did more than that. They flourished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow this particular V-frog was filling Donahue, quite obviously, with a feeling of friendliness, so that the army man pointed a finger at it through the glass of its cage and laughed to see it cock its head and sink down along its collapsing legs, as Donahue moved his finger downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t suppose we could get a few of these for Jupiter Nine, do you, Starr?\" he asked. \"We\u0027re great ones for pets here. An animal here and there makes for a breath of home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not very practical,\" said Lucky. \"V-frogs are difficult to keep. They have to be maintained in a carbon-dioxide-saturated system, you know. Oxygen is mildly poisonous to them. That makes things complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean they can\u0027t be kept in an open fish-bowl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can be at tunes. They\u0027re kept so on Venus, where carbon dioxide is dirt cheap and where they can always be turned loose in the ocean if they seem to be unhappy. On a ship, though, or on an airless world, you don\u0027t want to bleed carbon dioxide continuously into the air, so a closed system is best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" The commander looked a bit wistful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To return to our original subject of discussion,\" said Lucky briskly, \"I must refuse your suggestion that I leave. I have an assignment and I must carry it through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to take a few seconds for the commander to emerge from the spell cast by the V-frog. His face darkened. \"I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t understand the entire situation.\" He turned suddenly, looking down at Big-man. \"Consider your associate, for instance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small Martian, with a stiffening of spine, began to redden. \"I\u0027m Bigman,\" he said. \"I told you that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very big a man, nevertheless,\" said the commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though Lucky placed a soothing hand on the little fellow\u0027s shoulder at once, it didn\u0027t help. Bigman cried, \"Bigness isn\u0027t on the outside, mister. My name is Bigman, and I\u0027m a big man against you or anyone you want to name regardless of what the yardstick says. And if you don\u0027t believe it...\" He was shrugging his left shoulder vigorously. \"Let go of me, Lucky, will you? This cobber here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you wait just one minute, Bigman?\" Lucky urged. \"Let\u0027s find out what the commander is trying to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonahue had looked startled at Bigman\u0027s sudden verbal assault. He said, \"I\u0027m sure I meant no harm in my remark. If I\u0027ve hurt your feelings, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My feelings hurt?\" said Bigman, his voice squeaking. \"Me? Listen, one thing about me, I never lose my temper and as long as you apologize, we\u0027ll forget about it.\" He hitched at his belt and brought the palms of his hands down with a smart slap against the knee-high orange and vermilion boots that were the heritage of his Martian farm-boy past and without which he would never be seen in public (unless he substituted others with an equally garish color scheme).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to be very plain with you, Councilman,\" said Donahue, turning to Lucky once more. \"I have almost a thousand men here at Jupiter Nine, and they\u0027re tough, all of them. They have to be. They\u0027re far from home. They do a hard job. They run great risks. They have their own outlook on life now and it\u0027s a rough one. For instance, they haze newcomers and not with a light hand, either. Sometimes newcomers can\u0027t stand it and go home. Sometimes they\u0027re hurt. If they come through, everything\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Is this officially permitted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But it is permitted unofficially. The men have to be kept happy somehow, and we can\u0027t afford to alienate them by interfering with their horseplay. Good men are hard to replace out here. Not many people are willing to come to the moons of Jupiter, you know. Then, too, the initiation is helpful in weeding out the misfits. Those that don\u0027t pass would probably fail hi other respects eventually. That is why I made mention of your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander raised his hands hurriedly. \"Now make no mistake. I agree that he is big on the inside and capable and anything else you want. But will he be a match for what lies ahead? Will you, Councilman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the hazing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be rough, Councilman,\" said Donahue. \"The men know you are coming. News gets around somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know,\" murmured Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander scowled. \"In any case, they know you are to investigate them and they will feel no kindness toward you. They are in an ugly mood and they will hurt you, Councilman Starr. I am asking you not to land on Jupiter Nine for the project\u0027s sake, for my men\u0027s sake, and for your own. There you have it as plainly as I can put it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman stared at the change that came over Lucky. His usual look of calm good nature was gone. His dark brown eyes turned hard, and the straight lines of his lean and handsome face were set in something that Bigman rarely saw there: bitter anger. Every muscle of Lucky\u0027s tall body seemed tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said ringingly, \"Commander Donahue, I am a member of the Council of Science. I am responsible only to the head of the Council and to the President of the Solar Federation of Worlds. I outrank you and you will be bound by my decisions and orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I consider the warning you have just given me to be evidence of your own incompetence. Don\u0027t say anything, please; hear me out. You are obviously not in control of your men and not fit to command men. Now hear this: I will land on Jupiter Nine and I will conduct my investigations. I will handle your men if you cannot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused while the other gasped and vainly attempted to find his voice. He rapped out, \"Do you understand, Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Donahue, his face congested almost beyond recognition, managed to grind out, \"I will take this up with the Council of Science. No arrogant young whipsnap can talk like that to me, councilman or no councilman. I will match my record as a leader of men against that of anyone in the service. Furthermore, my warning to you will be on record also and if you are hurt on Jupiter Nine, I will run the risk of court-martial gladly. I will do nothing for you. In fact, I hope-I hope they teach you manners, you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was past speech once more. He turned on his heel, toward the open lock, connected still with the space tube to bis own ship. He clambered in, missing a hand hold in his anger and stumbling badly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman watched with awe as the commander\u0027s heels disappeared down the tube. The other\u0027s anger had been so intense a thing that the little Martian had seemed to feel it in his own mind as though waves of heat were rolling in upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Wow, that cobber was really going! You had him rocking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded. \"He was angry. No doubt about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Listen, maybe he\u0027s the spy. He\u0027d know the most. He\u0027d have the best chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d also be the most thoroughly investigated, so your theory is doubtful. But at least he\u0027s helped us out in a little experiment, so when I see him next I will have to apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apologize?\" Bigman was horrified. It was his firm view that apologies were strictly something that other people had to do. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, Bigman, do you suppose I really meant those things I said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t angry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an act?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could call it that. I wanted to make him angry, really angry, and 1 succeeded. I could tell that firsthand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Firsthand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t you? Couldn\u0027t you feel the anger just pouring out of him all over you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sands of Mars! The V-frog!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. It received the commander\u0027s anger and rebroadcast it on to us. I had to know if one V-frog could do it. We tested it back on Earth, but until I tried it under actual field conditions, I wasn\u0027t sure. Now I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It broadcast fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. So at least it proves we have a weapon, one weapon, after all.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-moons-of-jupiter-lucky-starr-5/page-3.html","bookId":1758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:21 AM"}
