Max talked to the man in charge, found out how many employees were working for him, and made certain he saw each face and spoke to each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately eighty guests were on their way to the house now. The backyard could easily handle the crowd, but there were places Patterson could hide if he got that far. Each entrance would be closely monitored. Spike had offered to watch the street in front of the house. He would arrive soon. Until then, Ellie’s father stood by the front door. Clark and Hershey would monitor the backyard and both sides of the house, and Max would stay with Ellie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caterers’ two vans were parked in the driveway, so the guests reached the backyard by following a brick pathway on the other side of the house. They passed under a trellised arch and entered the garden between two tall planters filled with fresh-cut flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the older guests didn’t want to take the roundabout way to the back but instead cut through the house. William ended up being a doorman. He greeted them at the door and escorted them through the house and out to the party, sometimes stopping in the kitchen for a conversation before the doorbell rang again and he was interrupted. As worried as he was about Patterson crashing the party, he was able to relax a little knowing that Ellie was safe with Max. He had no doubt that Max would give his life to protect her, though he prayed to God Patterson would be captured and led away peacefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile her father greeted guests inside, Ellie stood outside on the lawn welcoming the new arrivals. She felt as though she had said, “So happy to see you” and “So pleased you could come” at least a hundred times. And her hand had been grabbed and patted more than that. She heard, “You poor thing” and “What a heartbreak this must be for you” from some of her mother’s friends, and “What a trouper you are” and “You’re so brave” from others. Apparently, everyone in town had heard that Ava had stolen Ellie’s fiancé.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax stood behind her. When one woman patted Ellie’s hand and said, “Don’t you give up on love,” Ellie heard him cough, no doubt to cover his laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie’s mother was having a wonderful time, mingling among friends. Ellie couldn’t remember when she had seen her looking so radiant and happy. Her father walked out the back door with Mrs. Webster, their elderly neighbor, on his arm. He helped her down the steps and smiled across the lawn at his wife before turning around and going back inside. This was as it should be, Ellie thought. Their daughter was getting married. It was a happy time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes later, Max whispered in her ear, “Spike Bennett just arrived. He’ll keep an eye on the front now. I’ll tell your father he can come outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt seven thirty the violin began to play. Aunt Cecilia and Aunt Vivien were holding court inside the tent and having a fine time. It was much cooler there because the tent company had thought to bring two small air conditioners. Each had been strategically placed near the back of the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the stream of new guests began to dwindle, Ellie walked around the lawn chatting with old acquaintances and checking on the caterers. Max was never far away. If the opportunity arose, she introduced him as a friend of the family. Clark and Hershey were barely noticeable. Every so often she would catch sight of them strolling around the perimeter of the lawn, watching for any signs of danger. They were so inconspicuous, no one would have guessed their reason for being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Cecilia motioned to Ellie and asked her if she would please fetch her wrap. She was feeling the chill from the air conditioner but was too comfortable to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She just wants to show off her new shawl,” Vivien said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia nodded. “It is pretty, and I rarely get a chance to wear it. It’s on the chair in our bedroom. Be a dear and get it for me. I hate to move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time is it?” Vivien asked. “Shouldn’t Ava and John be here? And where’s Annie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie checked the time. “Knowing Ava, she’ll be here in five minutes on the dot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry then. You don’t want to miss her entrance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie was happy for a break. Max followed her into the house. While Ellie ran upstairs, he went to check the front door. He was pleased to find that her father had locked it. He stood at the bottom of the stairs waiting for her when he heard the scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie didn’t get as far as the bedroom. The linen closet door was wide-open. When she reached to pull it closed, Evan Patterson sprang at her from behind it. She saw the gun in his left hand and the loathing in his eyes. She screamed and shoved the door as hard as she could. It caught him in the side, and that gave her a second to get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was strong, terribly strong. As she turned to run, he grabbed her arm and yanked her toward him. His hand felt like a vise, squeezing hard enough to make her think he could snap her bone. It was impossible to get free. She saw his fist coming toward her. She kicked him in the shin with the sharp heel of her sandal, then kicked him again in the thigh. It didn’t stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe aimed for her jaw and would have shattered it, but she lowered her head just as his fist struck. The side of her forehead took the blow, stunning her. The ring he was wearing cut into her. She flinched from the searing pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was kicking and screaming when Max pulled him off of her. Her dress tore because Patterson wouldn’t let go. As strong as Patterson was, Max easily lifted him and threw him into the wall, but fury gave Patterson new strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax was trying to get the gun away from him and at the same time shield Ellie. Patterson rolled, then went flying down the stairs. Max pulled his gun and aimed, just as Patterson turned and fired one shot at them before ducking around the corner and disappearing. Max flew down the stairs after him, and Patterson shot again. The bullet went wild, hitting the ceiling as he was running out the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a diving leap, Max tackled him to the ground, but Patterson managed to get two more shots off. The bullets shattered one of the flowerpots, sending ceramic shards, like missiles, into the air. With his knee slammed into Patterson’s spine, Max forced the gun away. Clark grabbed it and helped restrain him while Hershey ran forward, pulling handcuffs from his back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreaming, the party guests ran for their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the house, Ava had just stepped out of her car, too impatient to wait for John to come around and open the door for her. She adjusted her skirt, fluffed her hair, and took a step toward the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stampede all but knocked her off her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY – EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aftermath wasn’t pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAva stood in the center of the backyard surveying the damage. She didn’t hear the thunder and was still standing there when the skies opened up and rain poured down on her. When she walked into the kitchen, she was soaked through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn got a towel and tried to pat her arms dry, but she pushed his hand away. She was shaking with outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is she?” she demanded in a shout that vibrated through the house and could have registered at least a seven on the Richter scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother sat at the table with her head in her hands as Ava ranted her accusations that Ellie had deliberately set out to ruin her party. After listening to the ridiculous outburst for several minutes, Claire raised up and said, “Ava, stop talking and go home. You’re giving me a headache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAva’s hand flew to her throat. “Mother, this was supposed to be my night. And John’s,” she added. “How could you take Ellie’s side?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t taken any side,” her mother said. “You don’t know what happened before you got out of your car,” she pointed out. “You shouldn’t blame anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I know who to blame. Ellie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop shouting. I know you’re upset-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Upset does not begin to describe what I’m feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This wedding has turned you into a crazy woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted it to be perfect. What’s wrong with that?” She burst into tears and moved into John’s arms to let him comfort her. “And the yard was so pretty after the flowers were delivered… and the tent was perfect and…” She suddenly pushed away from her fiancé. “Where is she?” she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the bathroom,” her mother relented. “Max and your father are tending to the cut on her forehead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAva stormed out of the kitchen, rushed past her aunts, who were sitting on the sofa enjoying slices of cake, and ran down the hallway, leaving puddles in her wake. She tried to get past her father, who was inadvertently blocking the bathroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie had already cleaned the cut with disinfectant from her father’s first-aid kit and was now sitting on the side of the tub holding her hair back while Max applied Steri-Strips. He wasn’t doing a good job because his hands were shaking. He was still so damned angry that Patterson had touched her, he could barely speak. Thoughts of what could have happened were racing through his mind. What if he had stayed outside? Patterson could have killed her before Max heard her scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Max…,” Ellie began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold still.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am holding still. I’m a physician. Let me-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I need to do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie had been holding her hair back so long, her arm was going to sleep. She didn’t complain, though. The look of anguish on Max’s face made her want to comfort him, but she knew he would have none of it. He felt he had failed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy, could you give Max and me a moment alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re still bleeding,” Max told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father put the first-aid kit in Ellie’s lap and pulled the door closed behind him. Ellie heard Ava shouting and quickly got up to lock the door. She ignored Ava’s pounding on the door as she took the Steri-Strips from Max and applied them to the cut. It took her three seconds to close the wound. Then she turned to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared back at her, still angry. “I messed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell are you thanking me for? Stop that. Now isn’t the time-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie kissed his cheek, then his jaw. “Thank you,” she whispered, “for saving my life and for catching him.” She rubbed her lips over his. “Now you say, ‘You’re welcome.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie, you could have been killed. I should have-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized they were back where they’d started. “You’re gonna keep this up until I say, ‘You’re welcome.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, until you kiss me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently wrapped his arms around her, whispered, “You’ve got blood in your hair,” and kissed her. Her mouth opened under his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while, Ava was banging on the door, threatening everything short of murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Max finally lifted his head, he said, “Want to borrow my gun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t hide in there forever, Ellie,” Ava shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Might as well get this over with,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax got in front of her and opened the door. He backed Ava up by simply walking into her. She didn’t have a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aunts were horrified by Ellie’s condition. Her torn dress was splattered with blood, and the hair around her wound was matted and bloody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come sit with us,” Aunt Cecilia said, patting the cushion between Vivien and her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie obeyed and smiled as each aunt tried to comfort her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir sympathy enraged Ava. “I’m the victim here,” she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see any blood on you,” her mother snapped. She sat down in the wingback chair next to the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Claire, the cake is delicious,” Cecilia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Annie?” Ava demanded. “She’ll take my side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s changing her clothes, and for heaven’s sake, there isn’t any side to take.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHershey motioned to Max. A minute later, Ellie looked over her shoulder to see the two men standing in the kitchen. Max had his hands in his pockets and was nodding every now and then at what Hershey was telling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Max walked back into the living room, William blurted, “This is all my fault. I left the front door unlocked when I was showing guests through the house. That’s how he got inside. Before Spike arrived, he hid upstairs and waited. That’s what he did, and it’s all my fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who hid upstairs?” Ava was trying to follow the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evan Patterson. He got into the house with a gun, and he waited upstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAva was stunned. “Why didn’t anyone tell me? I heard someone say Ellie was in trouble, but I didn’t know-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve been ranting and raving in the backyard for the last half hour,” Ellie said. “No one could get a word in edgewise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire turned to her husband. “You can’t blame yourself, William.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right, Dad,” Ellie agreed. “You need to focus on the good news. Evan Patterson is on his way to lockup, and Max told me that, because he had a gun and tried to kill me and a federal agent, he’s not going to get out for a long, long time, if ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father’s spirits lifted. “Yes, that’s true. I’ll admit not knowing where he was hiding was a constant worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAva slumped down in a chair. John kissed her forehead and announced that he was going to eat some dinner. The kitchen looked like a smorgasbord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every time…,” Ava grumbled. “It always becomes about you, Ellie. Every time. I’m getting married, but tonight wasn’t for me. I swear I think you planned it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways the drama queen, Ellie thought. She felt a burst of irritation and said, “That’s right, Ava. I planned the entire thing. I called Evan Patterson, and I said, ‘Listen, Evan honey, go get a gun, sneak into my parents’ house, and hide upstairs. I’ll let you punch me again and try to kill me so that Ava’s party will be ruined.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sarcasm isn’t appreciated, young lady,” her mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAva looked defeated. Her head fell forward, and her shoulders drooped. “Every time…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, for God’s sake,” Ellie said. “Okay, Ava. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I ruined your party. I really am. Everything was beautiful. You planned it perfectly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sister perked up a little. “I did, didn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Ellie said. Her head was starting to throb, her nerves were shot, and she was beginning to tremble in the aftershock of what she had been through. “Everything was gorgeous.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9/page-28.html","bookId":1828,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:24 PM"}
