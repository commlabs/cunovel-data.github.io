He stood on the floating dock until the launch was out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he headed back toward the ugly villa, his thoughts were on Preston Yarwood. Caitlin Evanger had said the lab report on Yarwood declared him dangerous in some vague way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas thought about his own recent experiences with jealousy. It was a powerful force. Furthermore, he knew, from the brief occasions in the psychic corridor when he\u0027d picked up on the rage of a wronged man, that a violent reaction was not uncommon in a jealous male. He\u0027d held rapiers that cuckolded men had once used to avenge their honor. He\u0027d felt the shattering fury that could lead a man to commit murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was possible that Yarwood had known such fury this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shook off the thoughts as he walked back into the main hall. Verity was coming downstairs. She had dried her hair and changed her clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they get off okay?\" she asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re gone.\" Jonas looked up at her and came to a decision. \"Put on a coat, Verity,\" he said softly. \"I want to go for a walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"Now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Now. It\u0027s stopped raining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity hesitated. He thought she might ask a few more questions but she didn\u0027t. She hurried back upstairs and came down with another parka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" she asked as he helped her into the jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out to the cliff where Elyssa fell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity looked up at him questioningly as they went outside. \"You suspect something, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to see if there\u0027s anything there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean any lingering vibrations of violence? Are you thinking about the fact that she and Yarwood have been quarreling lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"The thought crossed Doug\u0027s mind, too. But I\u0027m not sure what to think yet. I just want to see if I can pick up anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I can\u0027t see Yarwood doing anything that drastic, though, Jonas. He isn\u0027t the type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any man is the type if he\u0027s pushed far enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity gave him a sharp glance, then looked away. He didn\u0027t have to ask her what she was thinking. She was wondering if he was the type. \"Any man, Verity,\" Jonas said with quiet emphasis. \"Even a nice, gentle soul like Oliver Crump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" she said with the same quiet forcefulness he had used. \"A man like Oliver would never kill, except perhaps in self-defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bet on it.\" He gripped her arm more tightly than was necessary, annoyed with the way she had leaped to Crump\u0027s defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one said another word until they reached the cliff above the cove. Verity peered over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was lucky it was a relatively short drop. All the bushes growing on the side of the cliff probably broke the fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas followed her gaze. \"If she\u0027d landed wrong, she would have broken her neck.\" He felt the shudder that went through Verity and wished he\u0027d kept his mouth shut. \"Let\u0027s see what we can turn up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need something to touch, Jonas. Something that she might have touched as she went over the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to find exactly where she was standing when it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t see any footprints in these pine needles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity said as they started walking along the edge of the bluff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I should be able to feel something if we find the right spot. Watch your step.\" He tightened his grip on her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took another dozen steps before Jonas felt the atmosphere around him shiver with the familiar sensation of violence. Verity halted at once, watching his face intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close to here,\" he confirmed. \"But it\u0027s very faint. I\u0027ll have to work to get anything at all. Are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity nodded quickly and clasped her hands in front of her. \"Ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas took a step closer to the edge of the cliff and the vibrations grew stronger. There was a heady exultation in being able to control what had once threatened to overwhelm him. He could handle his talent these days, thanks to Verity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality curved around him, creating a corridor that had no end and no beginning. Jonas remained aware of his external surroundings as he entered the psychic tunnel in his head. He knew that Verity was experiencing the same disorienting feeling of dealing with two realities simultaneously. It could be done. A few months ago he\u0027d fought a duel in real time using the fencing skills he\u0027d \"borrowed\" from another dimension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she was there, he could always sense her presence. She was his anchor here. He saw her out of the corner of his eye, standing a short distance away from him in the dark corridor. She was staring straight ahead at a weak image that was slowly forming in front of them. The vision was barely discernible, probably because it was so recent in time, Jonas thought. His talent was at its strongest when the vision took place in what he considered his prime time, the Renaissance. In the past few months he\u0027d become powerful enough to pick up more recent scenes of violence. It had something to do with Verity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not only helped him control his talent, she had made him stronger. All the same, he couldn\u0027t get anything this recent to come through with much clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There she is, Jonas,\" Verity whispered. \"You were right. Look at the ribbons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hazy image of a woman toppling over the edge of the cliff hovered in front of them. It was Elyssa, a look of terror on her features as she clawed uselessly at the air. There was no way to tell who or what was behind her, but Jonas sensed a second presence in the image. Snaky tendrils of violent emotion were unraveling from the animated vision, flowing first toward him and then, as if caught by a magnet, toward Verity. The snakes were pale and weak compared to those that would have emerged from an older vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too damn hazy,\" he muttered. \"I can\u0027t tell what\u0027s happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it was just an accidentâ€”a violent accident,\" Verity said tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Jonas knew better and so did Verity. She just didn\u0027t want to admit it. His talent wasn\u0027t for random violence, like deaths caused by storms or accidents. The psychic ability that had nearly driven him insane was linked to the kind of violence men and women used against each other. \"There\u0027s someone else involved. I wouldn\u0027t be picking up anything at all if there wasn\u0027t.\" He reached out to touch one of the sickly pale ribbons that coiled around Verity\u0027s feet. The shivering tendril leaped hungrily for him, a nasty little snake that would poison him if he wasn\u0027t very careful. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-58.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
