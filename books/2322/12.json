Was it this stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand at the bottles. \"You know. The booze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell, no,\" I said. \"I wasn\u0027t even that heavy a hitter at the time. I just reached a point where I didn\u0027t feel like being a cop anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did it? Disillusionment? A lack of faith in the criminal justice system? Disgust with corruption?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I lost my illusions early in the game and I never had much faith in the criminal justice system. It\u0027s a terrible system and the cops just do what they can. As far as corruption goes, I was never enough of an idealist to be bothered by it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What then? Mid-life crisis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could call it that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we won\u0027t talk about it if you don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe fell silent for a moment. She drank and then I drank, and then I put my glass down and said, \"Well, it\u0027s no secret. It\u0027s just not something I talk about a lot. I was in a tavern up in Washington Heights one night. It was a place where cops could drink on the arm. The owner liked having us around so you could run a tab and never be asked for payment. I had every right to be there. I was off-duty and I wanted to unwind a little before I drove back out to the island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I wouldn\u0027t have gone home that night anyway. I didn\u0027t always. Sometimes I caught a few hours\u0027 sleep in a hotel room to save driving back and forth. Sometimes I didn\u0027t have to get a hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two punks held up the place,\" I went on. \"They got what was in the register and shot the bartender on the way out, shot him dead just for the hell of it. I ran out into the street after them. I was in plainclothes but of course I was carrying a gun. You always carry it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I emptied the gun at them. I got them both. I killed one of them and crippled the other. Left him paralyzed from the waist down. Two things he\u0027ll never do again are walk and fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d told this story before but this time I could feel it all happening again. Washington Heights is hilly and they\u0027d taken off up an incline. I remembered bracing myself, holding the gun with both hands, firing uphill at them. Maybe it was the Scotch that was making the recollection so vivid. Maybe it was something I responded to in her big unwavering gray eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And because you killed one and crippled another-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"That wouldn\u0027t have bothered me. I\u0027m only sorry I didn\u0027t kill them both. They murdered that bartender for no good reason on God\u0027s earth. I wouldn\u0027t lose a dime\u0027s worth of sleep over those two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the shots went wide,\" I said. \"Shooting uphill at a pair of moving targets, hell, it\u0027s remarkable I scored as well as I did. I always shot Expert on the police range, but it\u0027s different when it\u0027s real.\" I tried to draw my eyes away from hers but couldn\u0027t manage it. \"One shot missed, though, and it ricocheted off the pavement or something. Took a bad hop. And there was a little girl walking around or standing around, whatever the hell she was doing. She was only six years old. I don\u0027t know what the hell she was doing out at that hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I looked away. \"The bullet went into her eye,\" I said. \"The ricochet took off some of its steam so if it had been an inch to the side one way or the other it probably would have glanced off bone, but life\u0027s a game of inches, isn\u0027t it? There was no bone to get in the way and the bullet wound up in her brain and she died. Instantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t do anything wrong. There was a departmental investigation because that\u0027s standard procedure, and it was agreed unanimously that I hadn\u0027t done anything wrong. As a matter of fact I received a commendation. The child was Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Estrellita Rivera her name was, and sometimes the press gets on you when there\u0027s a minority group casualty like that, or you get static from community groups, but there was none of that in this case. If I was anything I was a fast-acting hero cop who had a piece of bad luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you quit the police force.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scotch bottle was empty. There was maybe half a pint of vodka in the other bottle and I poured a few ounces of it into my glass. \"Not right away,\" I said, \"but before too long. And I don\u0027t know what made me do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guilt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. All I know is that being a cop didn\u0027t seem to be fun anymore. Being a husband and a father didn\u0027t seem to work, either. I took a leave of absence from both, moved into a hotel a block west of Columbus Circle. Somewhere down the line it became clear that I wasn\u0027t going back, not to my wife, not to the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us said anything for a while. After a moment she leaned over and touched my hand. It was an unexpected and slightly awkward gesture and for some reason it touched me. I felt a thickening in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she had withdrawn her hand and was on her feet. I thought for a moment that she meant for me to leave. Instead she said, \"I\u0027m going to call the liquor store while they\u0027re still open. The nearest place is on Canal and they close early. Do you want to stick with Scotch or would you rather switch to bourbon? And what brand of bourbon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should probably be going soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scotch or bourbon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay with the Scotch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we waited for the liquor delivery she took me around the loft and showed me some of her work. Most of it was realistic, like the Medusa, but a few pieces were abstract. There was a lot of strength in her sculpture. I told her I liked her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pretty good,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t let me pay for the liquor, insisting that I was her guest. We sat in our chairs again, opened our respective bottles, filled our glasses. She asked me if I really liked her work. I assured her that I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m supposed to be good,\" she said. \"You know how I got into this? Playing with clay with the kids at the day-care center. I wound up taking the clay home, that yellow modeling clay, and working with it by the hour. Then I took a night course at Brooklyn College, an adult-ed class, and the instructor told me I had talent. He didn\u0027t have to tell me. I knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had some recognition. I had a show at the Chuck Levitan Gallery a little over a year ago. You know the gallery? On Grand Street?\" I didn\u0027t. \"Well, he gave me a one-man show. A one-woman show. A one-person show. Shit, you have to think before you talk nowadays, have you noticed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I had an NEA grant last year. National Endowment for the Arts. Plus a smaller grant from the Einhoorn Foundation. Don\u0027t pretend you heard of the Einhoorn Foundation. I never heard of it before I got the grant. I\u0027ve got pieces in some fairly decent collections. One or two in museums. Well, one, and it\u0027s not MOMA, but it\u0027s a museum. I\u0027m a sculptor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said you weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my kids are in California and I never see them. He has full custody. The hell, I moved out, right? I\u0027m some kind of unnatural woman in the first place, some dyke who deserts husband and kids, so of course he gets custody, right? I didn\u0027t make an issue of it. Do you want to know something, Matthew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want custody. I was done with day care. I had fucking had it with kids, my own included. What do you make of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds natural enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Maisie Pomperances of the world wouldn\u0027t agree with you. Excuse me, I mean Mitzi. Gordon and Mitzi Fucking Pomerance. Mr. and Mrs. High-School Yearbook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was able to hear the vodka in her voice now. She wasn\u0027t slurring her words any but there was a timbre to her speech that the alcohol had provided. It didn\u0027t surprise me. She had matched me drink for drink and I was hitting it pretty good myself. Of course I\u0027d had a head start on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he said he was moving to California I threw a fit. Yelled that it wasn\u0027t fair, that he had to stay in New York so I could visit them. I had visitation rights, I said, and what good were my visitation rights if they were three thousand miles away? But do you know something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was relieved. Part of me was glad they were going, because you wouldn\u0027t believe what it was like, traipsing out there on the subway once a week, sitting in the apartment with them or walking around Boerum Hill and always risking blank stares from Maisie Pomerance. Goddamn it, why can\u0027t I even get that goddamned woman\u0027s name right? Mitzi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got her number written down. You could always call her up and tell her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Oh, Jesus,\" she said. \"I gotta pee. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back she sat on the couch. Without preamble she said, \"You know what we are? Me with my sculpture and you with your existential angst, and what we are is a couple of drunks who copped out. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t patronize me. Let\u0027s face it. We\u0027re both alcoholics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a heavy drinker. There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could stop anytime I want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering the question she leaned forward to fill her glass. \"I stopped for a while,\" she said. \"I quit cold for two months. More than two months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just up and quit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to A.A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think it would work for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you could stop anytime you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, if I wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And anyway you\u0027re not an alcoholic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything at first. Then I said, \"I suppose it depends on how you define the word. Anyway, all it is is a label.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say you decide for yourself if you\u0027re an alcoholic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m deciding that I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided I was. And it worked for me. The thing is, they say it works best if you don\u0027t drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see where that might make a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I got on this subject.\" She drained her glass, looked at me over its rim. \"I didn\u0027t mean to get on this goddamned subject. First my kids and then my drinking, what a fucking down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Matthew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit next to me and help me forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined her on the couch and ran a hand over her fine hair. The sprinkling of gray hair enhanced its attractiveness. She looked at me for a moment out of those bottomless gray eyes, then let the lids drop. I kissed her and she clung to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe necked some. I touched her breasts, kissed her throat. Her strong hands worked the muscles in my back and shoulders like modeling clay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll stay over,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So would I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freshened both our drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awakened with church bells pealing in the distance. My head was clear and I felt good. I swung my legs over the side of the bed and met the eyes of a long-haired cat curled up at the foot of the bed on the other side. He looked me over, then tucked his head in and resumed napping. Sleep with the lady of the house and the cats accept you. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-12.html","bookId":2322,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM"}
