We stand before you – all of us here – and would pledge ourselves to your cause—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not quite,’ cut in Queen Abrastal, ‘since I don’t yet understand that cause, and by the look on the face of Prince Brys I suspect he shares my unease.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrughava hissed a curse in her own language, and then tried again. ‘Adjunct. Now is the time to coalesce our respective forces, thus bolstering our strength—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word struck like a knife driven into the floor between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colour left Krughava’s face. ‘If you doubt our loyalty or courage—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not,’ Tavore replied. ‘In fact, I am depending on it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But this makes no sense!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct turned to Abrastal. ‘Highness, your presence here is most unexpected, but welcome. Your kingdom, even more than that of King Tehol, has had long-term contact with those territories of Kolanse and the South Kingdoms of the Pelasiar Sea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is true, Adjunct.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What can you tell us of the situation there?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen’s brows lifted. ‘I assumed you were entirely aware of where you are headed, Adjunct. If that is not the case, then I am baffled. What manner of war do you seek? What is the cause for this belligerence of yours?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that Tavore was unwilling to answer. Silence stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one who finally spoke startled them all. ‘The Worm will feed.’ Banaschar slowly lifted his head. ‘She will gorge on the slaughter to come.’ His bleary gaze wandered among them, settled on the Bolkando queen. ‘What are you worth? Any of you?’ He nodded to the Adjunct. ‘She thinks … enough. Enough worth to fight an impossible war. For you, Highness. And you, Prince Brys. And,’ he faltered for a moment, as if about to be sick, ‘even me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t understand,’ said Abrastal, ‘but I will let the matter rest for now. To answer you, Adjunct, I must weave a tale. And,’ she added, ‘my throat grows parched.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSort walked to the curtain entrance, leaned out and ordered her captains to find some ale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen snorted and then said, ‘Well, I suppose ale better suits a story told than does wine. Very well, I shall begin. They came from the sea. Isn’t that always the way? No matter. There was trouble in the lands long before that day, however. Decades of drought. Uprisings, civil wars, usurpations, a host of once wealthy nations now verging on utter collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In such times, prophets are known to rise. Bold revolutions, the heads of kings and queens on spear points, blood in the streets. But against a sky empty of rain no cause triumphs, no great leader from the masses can offer salvation, and before long even their heads adorn spikes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSort arrived with a cask of ale and a dozen or so tin cups. She set about serving drinks, beginning with the queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal swallowed down a quick mouthful, sighed, and resumed, ‘One can imagine how it must have felt. The world was ending. Civilization itself had failed, revealing its terrible fragilities – that clutter of thin sticks holding it all upright. In place of rain, despair settled upon the lands. In Kolanse, only the province of Estobanse thrived. Fed by glacial streams and rivers, sheltered from the hot winds of the south, by this one province all of Kolanse struggled on – but there were too many mouths to feed and the strain was taking its toll. If there was a solution to this strait, it was too cruel to contemplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The strangers from the sea had no such qualms, and when they cast down the rulers of Kolanse they did what they deemed necessary—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A cull,’ said the Adjunct, and that word seemed to take the life from Tavore’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal regarded Tavore a moment over the rim of her cup, drank, and then nodded. ‘Just so. In the first year, they reduced the population of Kolanse by fifty per cent. The least fit, the elderly, the sickly. Another ten per cent the next year, and then, with more of their own kind coming in great ships, they sent armies into the South Kingdoms. Adjudication, they called it. They titled themselves Inquisitors, in their hands they held the justice of the land itself – and that justice proved harsh indeed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal hesitated, and then shrugged. ‘That was pretty much the end of our trade with the east. As we are people of the land, not the sea, we sent out merchant caravans along the old south routes, but those few that returned told tales of nothing but desolation. The merchant ships we then hired ventured into the Pelasiar Sea, and found silted-in ports and abandoned cities all along the coasts. They could find no one left with whom to trade.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-91.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
