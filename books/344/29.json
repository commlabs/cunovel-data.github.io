His pride was interested in the reliability of the information given him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was on the faith of these that Mr. Saunders, his employer, had risked a considerable sum of money, and now it looked as if he would be richly repaid for his investment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As Guy stood on deck regarding the island, Captain Richmond walked up to his side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, captain,” said Guy, “we have been successful. This is the island I wanted to find.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, it is the island; but what good will it do you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Guy had not made a confidant of the captain except in a general way. He distrusted the man, and feared that in some manner he would interfere with his plans.{229}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can tell you better after a few days,” answered Guy, guardedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you expect to find an immense treasure?” said Captain Richmond, with a sneer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then all I can say is that you are probably doomed to disappointment.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why do you say that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All these stories of hidden treasures are old women’s tales.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I am disappointed,” said Guy, somewhat nettled, “you will not be a loser.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wasn’t thinking of that; but I hate to see a man make a fool of himself.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Am I the man?” asked Guy, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, but the man who has supplied you with money to make this expedition.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When you see Mr. Saunders you can tell him so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, how long do you propose to delay my voyage in keeping me in this out-of-the-way place?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As short a time as possible, Captain Richmond. I should like to go on shore at once, if convenient, and commence my search. Mr. Titcomb and Mr. Clark will go with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well. I will send you ashore, as you desire.{230} I have this to say, however, that I shall not be willing to remain here more than three days.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I protest against this limit, Captain Richmond,” said Guy, indignantly. “The contract which I made with your owners says nothing of any such limitations. I am paying a handsome sum for any detention which my business here may occasion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are paying——” began the captain, with a sneer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, as the agent of Mr. Saunders,” responded Guy, firmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The captain turned upon his heel and left Guy, but he gave orders that the long-boat should be lowered, and in five minutes Guy and his two assistants were on their way to the island.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Osprey anchored about a hundred yards from the shore, in order not to get into too shallow water. The boat trip was, therefore, a brief one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a beautiful morning. The island smiled in the bright rays of a tropical sun, and the luxuriant vegetation that covered the hills and plains made it look very attractive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This is a charming spot, Guy,” said Abner Titcomb. “The pirates knew what they were about when they selected it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I imagine they cared very little for its appearance,{231}” said Guy. “It seems to be the nearest of the islands, and, therefore, the most accessible.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I were well provided with comforts, I shouldn’t object to spending a few months here,” said Luke Clark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nor I, if at the end of that time I could get off and sail for home.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They made for a little, sandy beach on the south shore, and one of the sailors, leaping out of the boat, hauled it upon the beach. Guy and his two assistants sprang out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When do you want us to come back?” asked the boatswain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Guy took out his watch.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall spend the day on the island,” he said. “You can come for us at six o’clock.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But we shall get hungry before that,” objected Titcomb.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought of that, and asked the steward to put up some lunch for us,” answered Guy, pointing to a square package wrapped in stout paper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall want drink, also.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It will be strange if we can’t find a spring on the island.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Guy and his two friends stood on the shore and watched the boat as it was rowed back to the ship.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can understand the feelings of Robinson Crusoe,{232}” Guy said. “Here we are many thousand miles from home, on an island which has not even a name, so far as I know.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “True; but there’s our ship, ready to carry us away when we choose. That makes the difference between us and Crusoe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should prefer that there should be a difference. I don’t care to feel myself a prisoner here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What are your plans for the day, Guy? You are the leader of our expedition. Shall we begin our search for the treasure immediately?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To-day let us simply be explorers. I should like to see something of the island. Suppose we strike for the woods.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just as you say. We shall have a delightful walk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The woods began about a mile from the beach, but there were scattered trees on the way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On their branches were birds of strange plumage. They were singing, but the songs were unlike any that the three explorers had heard in America.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were flowers, also, for on this far-away island it was the season of blooming, and their fragrance perfumed the air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wonder if there are any inhabitants?” said Luke Clark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Probably there are no white inhabitants, and{233} I hope there are none of a different race. They might prove dangerous, and interfere with our plans.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It almost seems a waste of productive power that such a delightful island should be uninhabited,” said Abner Titcomb. “Suppose it were within a few miles of Boston or New York, or near Portland, how it would attract visitors.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Like Peak’s Island,” suggested Luke Clark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is that?” asked Guy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Three miles from Portland. It is much smaller than this, but it attracts many visitors in the summer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Unfortunately, we can’t move this island. Indeed, I shouldn’t want to till I have found the treasure.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They reached the edge of the woods and plunged in. There was very little underbrush, but the trees rose straight and erect, branching at a considerable distance from the ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What a fine grove for a camp meeting,” said Luke Clark. “Do you know how far the trees reach back, Guy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Three or four miles, according to my description.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shall we push through?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes. Back of the woods rises the small hill{234} indicated on my plan of the island. I propose that we ascend that, and take a general view. It may be high enough for us to see the shore on the other side.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not a work of difficulty to reach the hill and ascend it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The rise was gradual, and the hill was comparatively bare of trees. Thus far they had discovered nothing that indicated any previous occupation by white men; but now on the summit of the hill they saw a pole looking somewhat like a telegraph pole.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you see that, Guy?” said Abner Titcomb.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That must have been placed there by white visitors.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Probably by some of the pirates of whom my uncle speaks.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; and so far it is a confirmation of his story.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are right. It should be looked upon as encouraging.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was something else that suggested former visits. On the top of the hill, a hundred feet from the pole, was a rude seat made by a plank resting upon supports at either end.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let us sit down,” said Guy, “and take a general survey of the island.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82144.html","bookId":344,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:03:47 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:03:47 AM"}
