You can travel anywhere and communicate in ways I never even dreamt of when I first lived. How are you supposed to find a place for yourself in a world this convoluted and uncaring?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife was much simpler sixteen hundred years ago. Most people never travelled more than a few kilometres from the spot where they were born. Men sometimes went off to fight in distant countries, and came back with tales of strangely dressed folk who spoke different languages and believed in frightful gods. But girls and women rarely saw such sights, unless they were kidnapped by rival warriors and carted off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a peaceful time when I was born. No great wars. Food was plentiful. Laws were respected by most clans. We built huts, made our own clothes, farmed the land, herded tame animals, hunted the wild. We married young, bore lots of children, worshipped our gods and died happily if we lived to be forty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen demons invaded. They attacked without mercy and dug up the remains of our dead, creating new beasts out of the rotting flesh and bones, turning our own ancestors against us. We fought as best we could, but for each one we killed, five more appeared. They terrorised villages across the land. It was only a matter of time before we would all suffer horrible, painful deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our darkest hour, an unlikely saviour appeared. A gruff druid led a small band of our warriors on a mission to send the demons back to their foul universe. I went with them, and so did a simple boy known only as Bran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove back the demons, but one of them-Lord Loss, a red-skinned demon master with eight arms and no heart-imprisoned me in a cave beneath the earth. I was shut off from the world of light. In the darkness, he sent his familiars to torture and kill me. The pain was unbearable and death, when it came, was a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least it should have been. But for some unknown reason, when my body perished, my soul remained trapped in the cave. There was to be no escape for me, even in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was held captive for many long, depressing centuries. Mine was a world of darkness and absolute desolation. Lacking a body, I couldn\u0027t even sleep. I was conscious for every minute of every long day and night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see or learn anything of the human world, but I was at the focal point of what had once been a tunnel between the Demonata\u0027s universe and ours. By focusing hard, I could trace the shattered strands of the tunnel back to their source, and from there magically peer into the demons\u0027 den.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a lot happened in that part of the universe, but demons occasionally drifted by or stopped to test the tunnel in the hope that they might be able to rekindle it. I worried that one of them might succeed, so I kept a close watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter sixteen hundred years my worries proved well-founded. For the first time I sensed movement in the human world. A boy of great power had come to live in the area close to the cave. I could feel him being manipulated. He was led to the cave and tricked into trying to reopen the tunnel. I tried to warn the boy, to stop him. But he couldn\u0027t understand me. The tunnel was reactivated and demons flooded through in their thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat should have been the end, but the boy returned when all seemed lost. He came with another teenager and an elderly magician-Bran! My old friend had survived and grown more powerful than any of us could have imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs strong as Bran and the boys were, it wasn\u0027t enough. Hundreds of demons stood between them and the cave. They tried to break through, but failed. It looked like everything was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something remarkable happened. A magical force connected me with the boys. It united the three of us and we became the Kah-Gash, an ancient weapon of incredible power. Without knowing what we were doing, we took the universes back through time, to the night when the tunnel was opened. Bran and the boys seized this fresh opportunity and put a stop to the onslaught, denying the demon hordes access to our world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the battle an innocent bystander-a boy called Bill-E Spleen-was killed. I felt myself drawn to the dead boy As my spirit seeped into his corpse, I found myself capable of restoring the body\u0027s functions. I set the heart beating and it pumped blood through the veins and arteries. The brain sparked at my urging. Lungs rose and fell. Bill-E drew breath... and so did I. My first free breath after sixteen hundred years of imprisonment. No words can describe the deliciousness of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Bran and the others stared at me, amazed and afraid, I set about altering the body I\u0027d taken over, reshaping it, giving it my face, my build, my sex. Within hours it was a boy\u0027s body no longer, but a girl\u0027s, with breath, a heartbeat, bones, guts, flesh, blood, a face. I was alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when my problems really began. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-2.html","bookId":2181,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM"}
