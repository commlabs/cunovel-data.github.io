To them, Admiral Zhou’s safety was of utmost importance. If he failed in saving Admiral Zhou, then what was the meaning behind all Zhou Weiqing had done? He had already done his utmost, exhausting all of his abilities, and was truly afraid it would all come to naught. If that was so, he was afraid he would not be able to take it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAdmiral Zhou’s face muscles twitched once more. Soon after, his body began to tremble lightly. Upon seeing that, Zhou Weiqing held onto his mother tightly, almost not daring to continue watching. After all, his father’s body had pretty much fully broken down from the Fate Denying Seal, and under such a circumstance, how could the recovery be so easy? He had done all he could with the Astral Saint Energy, filling his father’s body with the Power of Creation. Whether or not it would actually help his father, even he was not clear, so how could he not be nervous?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Xuuu…” Admiral Zhou seemed to take a long breath as the trembling of his body stopped. Slowly, his eyes opened, a faint layer of black air emitting from his body, as a pure Darkness Attribute energies began to revolve around his body, as his nine set of Heavenly Jewels appeared around his wrist.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was only at this point that Zhou Weiqing could finally heave a sigh of relief, and the expressions of those surrounding also eased up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAdmiral Zhou’s eyes were still hazy and confused. Looking around at the surrounding people, he was stunned for some time before he finally said in a hoarse voice: “Where is this? Am I still alive?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Father, this is our Heavenly Bow Empire! Of course you’re still alive, we all are still alive.” Zhou Weiqing let go of his mother, taking two quick steps forward.

As his emotions finally relaxed out, the suppressed sorrow, depression bottled up in his heart was released all at once. Even though he had been so strong just a second ago, able to kill a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, but currently he was just an ordinary young man who had finally found his parents again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAdmiral Zhou truly lived up to his name as Admiral Zhou, recovering quickly. Looking at his son, now taller and bigger, hugging his leg and crying, his face darkened, and he grabbed onto Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder and pulled him up. “What are you crying about, Your Father, I, have not died yet.

After that, I returned to our Heavenly Bow Empire to reform our army, gathering our original Heavenly Bow Empire soldiers and finally counter attacking the Heavenly Bow City. With everyone’s help, we attacked and reclaimed the city, vanquished our enemies and also took down your Fate Denying Seal.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing used the shortest, simplest summary of these last few years. Just a simple description, but how could it show all that he had gone through, the trials and tribulations he had forged his way through; but he was indeed unwilling to do so.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs he spoke, Zhou Weiqing pulled his father to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, saying: “Father, let me introduce you. This is my Master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, known as the strongest under the Heavenly God Stage, Master Long.” Naturally it was not proper etiquette for him to speak out his master’s full name, and he could only speak as such.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Long Shiya had already withdrawn his Heavenly Energy, he was still a Heavenly Emperor, and the quality of aura he displayed was definitely incomparable. Admiral Zhou was after all already a nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, and he could clearly sense Long Shiya’s terrifying power. Quickly, he bowed down respectfully, saying: “Many thanks Senior for rescuing our Heavenly Bow Empire from our troubles and disaster.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

Was it not this old senior here? However, he knew the power of his own Fate Denying Seal, even a Heavenly King powerhouse would have difficulty taking it down. Since Zhou Weiqing was able to invite a Heavenly Emperor here, it should clearly be this Senior who rescued them! Looking around, he could not see anyone else who had the power to break through his Fate Denying Seal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Senior, please do not joke around with me.

As the saying goes, Much water runs by the mill that the miller knows not of. It is your precious son! This old man did not do much, and he pretty much single handedly rescued your Heavenly Bow Empire. If you want to thank someone, you can thank him.

This fight, you do not need to take action already. You have only just been released from the Fate Denying Seal, and the most important thing for you to do now is to rest and recover. Godfather, why don’t you get the guards and servants to tidy up the palace first? After that, you just need to wait for our warriors to finish up and return with news of our resounding victory.

Although the Kalise and Bai Da combined forces had started trying to react, their first thought was that it was the internal Heavenly Bow City which was in trouble. However, the ranking army officers all knew that there were so many powerhouses guarding the palace, and thus they had not been too worried at first. However, by the time the Heavenly Bow Empire armies had started their attack, the raining oil and fire from above had already sealed the deal for this fight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll along, the Peerless Regiment was a powerful force in its own right, one that could change the entire battlefield by themselves. When they had fought in the northern borders, even against the powerful WanShou Empire armies, they had been able to slaughter vast numbers of enemies without losses.
