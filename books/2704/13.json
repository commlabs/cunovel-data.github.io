As they did so the searchlight swept across the distant horizon again, lighting up the broad expanse of the river and the low-lying banks on either side. There was no doubt in anyone\u0027s mind what it was. \"It\u0027s the Hunter, isn\u0027t it, Dad?\" whispered Jenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilas knew Jenna was right, but he said, \"Well, it could be anything, poppet. Just a boat out fishing ... or something,\" he added lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s the Hunter. In a fast-pursuit bullet boat, if I\u0027m not mistaken,\" snapped Marcia, who had suddenly stopped feeling sick. Marcia didn\u0027t realize it, but she no longer felt sick because Muriel had stopped bouncing through the water. In fact, Muriel had stopped doing anything at all, except slowly drifting nowhere in particular. Marcia looked accusingly at Nicko. \"Get a move on, Nicko. What have you slowed down for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing I can do. The wind\u0027s dropped,\" muttered Nicko, worried. He had just turned Muriel toward the Marram Marshes only to find that the wind had died. Muriel had lost all speed, and her sails were hanging limply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we can\u0027t just sit here,\" said Marcia, anxiously watching the searchlight coming rapidly closer. \"That bullet boat\u0027s going to be here in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you rustle up some wind for us?\" Silas asked Marcia, agitated. \"I thought you did Element Control on the Advanced Course. Or make us invisible. Come on, Marcia. Do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t just \u0027rustle up some wind,\u0027 as you put it. There\u0027s nowhere near enough time. And you know Invisibility is a personal spell. I can\u0027t do it for anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe searchlight swept across the water again. Bigger, brighter, nearer. And coming toward them fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to use the paddles,\" said Nicko, who, as skipper, had decided to take charge. \"We can paddle over to the marsh and hide there. Come on. Quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcia, Silas and Jenna grabbed a paddle each. Boy 412 woke up with a start as Jenna thumped his head down on the deck in her rush to pick up a paddle. He looked around him unhappily. Why was he still in the boat with all the Wizards? What did they want him for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna thrust the remaining paddle into his hand. \"Paddle!\" she told him. \"As fast as you can!\" Jenna\u0027s tone of voice reminded Boy 412 of his drill teacher. He put his paddle into the water and paddled as fast as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, far too slowly, Muriel crept toward the safety of the Marram Marshes while the bullet boat\u0027s searchlight swung backward and forward across the water, mercilessly seeking out its prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna stole a look behind her and, to her horror, saw the black shape of the bullet boat. It was like a long repulsive beetle, its five pairs of thin black legs silently slicing through the water to and fro, to and fro, as the highly trained oarsmen pushed themselves and the boat to the limits, gaining fast on Muriel\u0027s frantically paddling occupants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting in the prow was the unmistakable shape of the Hunter, tense and ready to pounce. Jenna caught the Hunter\u0027s cold, calculating stare and suddenly she felt brave enough to talk to Marcia. \"Marcia,\" said Jenna, \"we\u0027re not going to reach the marshes in time. You must do something. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Marcia looked surprised at being spoken to so directly, she approved. Spoken like a true Princess, she thought. \"Very well,\" agreed Marcia. \"I could try a Fog. I can do that in fifty-three seconds. If it\u0027s cold and damp enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriel\u0027s crew was sure that there were no problems with the cold and damp bit. They just hoped they had fifty-three seconds left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone stop paddling,\" instructed Marcia. \"Keep still. And quiet. Very quiet.\" Muriel\u0027s crew did as they were told, and in the silence that fell, they heard a new sound in the distance. The rhythmic splash of the bullet boat\u0027s oars. Marcia gingerly stood up, wishing that the floor wouldn\u0027t move around so much. Then she leaned against the mast to steady herself, took a deep breath and threw her arms wide, her cloak flying out like a pair of purple wings. \"Murken Wake!\" the ExtraOrdinary Wizard whispered as loud as she dared. \"Murken Wake and Refuge Make!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful spell. Jenna watched as thick white clouds gathered themselves together in the bright moonlit sky, quickly obscuring the moon and bringing down a deep chill into the night air. In the darkness all became deathly still as the first delicate tendrils of mist started rising from the black water as far as the eye could see. Faster and faster the tendrils grew, gathering together and growing into thick swathes of Fog, as the mist from the marshes rolled over the water to join them. In the very center, in the eye of the Fog, sat Muriel, becalmed and patiently waiting as the mist tumbled, swirled and thickened around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon Muriel was blanketed by a deep white thickness that struck a damp chill into Jenna\u0027s bones. Next to her she felt Boy 412 start shivering badly. He was still chilled from his time under the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifty-three seconds precisely,\" Marcia\u0027s voice muttered from out of the Fog. \"Not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhh,\" shushed Silas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick white silence fell in the little boat. Slowly Jenna lifted her hand and placed it in front of her wide-open eyes. She could see nothing but whiteness. But she could hear everything. She could hear the synchronized splash of ten knife-sharp oars being dipped into the water and out again, in and out, in and out. She could hear the swishing whisper of the bullet boat\u0027s prow slicing through the river, and now - now the bullet boat was so close that she could even hear the labored breathing of the oarsmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" the Hunter\u0027s voice boomed through the Fog. The splash of the oars ceased and the bullet boat drifted to a halt. Inside the Fog Muriel\u0027s occupants held their breath, convinced that the bullet boat was very close indeed. Maybe close enough for them to reach out and touch. Or close enough even for the Hunter to leap onto Muriel\u0027s crowded deck...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna felt her heart beating fast and loud, but she made herself breathe slowly, silently, and stay completely still. She knew that although they could not be seen, they could still be heard. Nicko and Marcia were doing the same. Silas was too, with the added interest of having one hand clasped around Maxie\u0027s long, damp muzzle to stop him from howling and the other hand slowly and calmly stroking the agitated wolfhound, who had become quite spooked by the Fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna could feel Boy 412,\u0027s constant shivering. She slowly reached out her arm and pulled him close to her to try and warm him up. Boy 412 seemed tense. Jenna could tell he was listening hard to the Hunter\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have them!\" the Hunter was saying. \"This is a Hexed Fog if ever I saw one. And what do you always find in the middle of a Hexed Fog? One hexing Wizard. And her accomplices.\" His low, self-satisfied chuckle drifted through the Fog and made Jenna shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give ... yourselves ... up.\" The Hunter\u0027s disembodied voice enveloped Muriel. \"The Qu - the Princess has nothing to fear from us. Neither do the rest of you. We are only concerned for your own safety and wish to escort you back to the Castle before you have an unfortunate accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna hated the Hunter\u0027s oily voice. She hated the way they could not escape it, the way they had to just sit there and listen to his silky smooth lies. She wanted to shout at him. To tell him that she was in charge here. That she would not listen to his threats. That soon he would be sorry. And then she felt Boy 412 take a deep breath, and she knew exactly what he was going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna clapped her hand tightly around Boy 412\u0027s mouth. He struggled with her and tried to push her away, but she grabbed his arms with her other hand and held them tightly against his sides. Jenna was strong for her size and very quick. Boy 412 was no match for her, thin and weak as he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy 412 was furious. His last chance to redeem himself had been thwarted. He could have returned to the Young Army as a hero, having bravely foiled the Wizards\u0027 attempt to escape. Instead he had the Princess\u0027s grubby little hand shoved over his mouth, which was making him feel sick. And she was stronger than him. That wasn\u0027t right. He was a boy and she was just a stupid girl. In his anger Boy 412 kicked out and hit the deck with a loud thump. At once Nicko was on him, pinning his legs down and holding him so tightly that he was completely unable to move or make another sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the damage was done. The Hunter was loading his pistol with a silver bullet. Boy 412\u0027s angry kick had been all the Hunter needed to pinpoint exactly where they were. He smiled to himself as he turned the pistol on its tripod to face into the Fog. He was indeed pointing it straight at Jenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcia heard the metallic clicks of the silver bullet being loaded, a sound she had heard once before and never forgotten. She thought fast. She could do a Begird and Preserve, but she understood the Hunter well enough to know that he would merely watch and wait until the spell faded. The only solution, thought Marcia, was a Projection. She just hoped she had enough energy to maintain it. Marcia closed her eyes and Projected. She Projected an image of Muriel and all its occupants sailing out of the Fog at full speed. Like all Projections it was a mirror image, but she hoped that in the darkness, and with leiruM already sailing away fast, the Hunter would not notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir!\" came the shout of an oarsman. \"They\u0027re trying to outrun us, sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of the pistol being primed ceased. The Hunter swore. \"Follow them, you idiots!\" he screamed at the oarsmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly the bullet boat pulled away from the Fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faster!\" yelled the Hunter angrily, unable to bear the sight of his prey escaping him for the third time that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the Fog, Jenna and Nicko grinned. Score: one up for them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-13.html","bookId":2704,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
