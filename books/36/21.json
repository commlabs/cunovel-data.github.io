I created it ALL AT ONCE, and All Of It exists right now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe experience of “older” and “younger” to which you refer has to do with the levels of awareness of a particular soul, or Aspect of Being.

Every element carries the imprint.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Awareness” is the experience of that consciousness being awakened. The individual aspect of the ALL becomes aware of Itself.

As you keep enlarging your idea about your Self, you create new do’s and don’ts, yeses and nos to encircle that. These are the boundaries that “hold in” something which cannot be held in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot hold in “you,” because you are as boundless as the Universe. Yet you can create a concept about your boundless self by imagining, and then ac-cepting, boundaries.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn a sense, this is the only way you can know yourself as anything in particular.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat which is boundless is boundless. That which is limitless is limitless. It cannot exist anywhere, because it is everywhere. If it is everywhere, it is nowhere in particular.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod is everywhere. Therefore, God is nowhere in particular, because to be somewhere in particular, God would have to not be somewhere else—which is not possible for God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one thing that is “not possible” for God, and that is for God to not be God. God cannot “not be.” Nor can God not be like Itself. God cannot “un-God” Itself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am everywhere, and that’s all there is to it. And since I am everywhere, I am nowhere.

And do you understand it better now? Do you see how you have created your ideas of “right” and “wrong” simply to define Who You Are?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo you see that without these definitions—bounda-ries—you are nothing?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd do you see that, like Me, you keep changing the boundaries as you change your Ideas of Who You Are?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I get what You are saying, but it does not seem that I have changed the boundaries—my own personal bounda-ries—very much. To me it has always been wrong to kill. It has always been wrong to steal. It has always been wrong to hurt another. The largest concepts by which we govern ourselves have been in place since the beginning of time, and most human beings agree on them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen why do you have war?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause there will always be some who break the rules.

It is going to violate much of what is held as truth in your present thought system. Yet I cannot let you go on living with these constructions if this dialogue is to serve you. So we must, now, in this second book, meet some of these concepts head on. But it’s going to be bumpy going here for a while. Are you ready?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI think so, yes. Thanks for the warning.

You could point out to them that what many people considered “right” at one time-burning people at the stake for what was considered witchcraft, as an example—is considered “wrong” today.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou could tell them that a definition of “right” and “wrong” is a definition established not only by time, but also by simple geography. You could allow them to notice that some activities on your planet (prostitution, for instance) are illegal in one place, and, just a few miles down the road, legal in another. And so, whether a person is judged as having done something “wrong” is not a matter of what that person has actually done, but of where he has done it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow I am going to repeat something I said in Book 1, and I know that it was very, very difficult for some to grasp, to understand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHitler went to heaven.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure people are ready for this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this book, and of all the books in the trilogy we are creating, is to create readiness—readiness for a new paradigm, a new understanding; a larger view, a grander idea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I’m going to have to ask the questions here that I know so many people are thinking and wanting to ask.

We have to have our sins burned away. It’s not too pleasant, I can tell you. And the more sins we’ve got, the longer it takes to burn them out—the longer we stay. That’s what I’ve been told.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI understand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut at least we won’t go to hell, which is forever.

Mortal sins are serious. Kind of like Major Crimes. Theological Felonies. Things like murder, rape, stealing. Venial sins are rather minor. Theological Misdemeanors. A venial sin would be like missing church on Sunday. Or, in the old days, eating meat on Friday.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute!

It’s not a place of punishment, but it’s not heaven, either. It’s... well... limbo.

No matter how faultless or innocent babies are—or any persons, for that matter—they have to be baptized to get into heaven. Otherwise God can’t accept them.

You can’t be baptized in the wrong church, you can’t get married in the wrong church—you can’t even attend a wrong church. I know this for a fact because as a young man I wanted to go with my parents to the wedding of a friend—I was actually asked to be in the wedding as an usher—but the nuns told me I should not accept the invitation because it was in the wrong church.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDid you obey them?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe nuns? No. I figured God—You—would show up at the other church just as willingly as You showed up at mine, so I went.
