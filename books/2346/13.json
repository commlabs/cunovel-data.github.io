Which meant you could fit nearly a million and a half of them in an acre. Which meant you could hide a hundred-fifty billion of them inside Fort Bird\u0027s perimeter wire. Which meant that looking for one would be like looking for a single anthrax spore in Yankee Stadium. I did the calculation while I showered and dressed in the predawn darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I sat on my bed and waited for some light in the sky. No point in going out there and missing the 1-in-150-billion chance because it was too dark to see properly. But as I sat I started to figure we could narrow the odds by being intelligent about where exactly we looked. The guy with the yogurt obviously made it back from A to B. We knew where A was. A was where Carbone had been killed. And there was a limited choice of places for B. B was either a random hole in the perimeter wire or somewhere among the main post buildings. So if we were smart, we could cut the billions to millions, and find the thing in a hundred years instead of a thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless it was already licked clean inside some starving raccoon\u0027s den.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Summer in the MP motor pool. She was bright and full of energy but we didn\u0027t talk. There was nothing to say, except that the task we had set for ourselves was impossible. And I guessed neither of us wanted to confirm that out loud. So we didn\u0027t speak. We just picked a Humvee at random and headed out. I drove, for a change, the same three-minute journey I had driven thirty-some hours before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Humvee\u0027s trip meter we traveled exactly a mile and a half and according to its compass we traveled south and west, and then we arrived at the crime scene. There were still tatters of MP tape on some of the trees. We parked ten yards off the track and got out. I climbed up on the hood and sat on the roof above the windshield. Gazed west and north, and then turned around and gazed east and south. The air was cold. There was a breeze. The landscape was brown and dead and immense. The dawn sun was weak and pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way did he go?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"North and east,\" Summer called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded pretty sure about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed up on the hood and sat next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a vehicle,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we didn\u0027t find one left out here, and I doubt if they walked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because if they\u0027d walked, it would have happened closer to where they started. This is at least a thirty-minute walk from anywhere. I don\u0027t see the bad guy concealing a tire iron or a crowbar for thirty solid minutes, not walking side by side. Under a coat, it would make him move like a robot. Carbone would have twigged. So they drove. In the bad guy\u0027s vehicle. He had the weapon under a jacket or something on the backseat. Maybe the knife and the yogurt too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did they start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter. Only thing that matters to us now is where the bad guy went afterward. And if he was in a vehicle, he didn\u0027t drive outward toward the wire. We can assume there are no vehicle-sized holes in it. Man-sized maybe, or deer-sized, but nothing big enough to drive a truck or a car through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he headed back to the post. He can\u0027t have gone anywhere else. Can\u0027t just drive a vehicle into the middle of nowhere. He drove back along the track and parked his vehicle and went about his business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Looked at the western horizon ahead of me. Turned and looked north and east, back along the track. Back toward the post. A mile and a half of track. I pictured the aerodynamics of an empty yogurt container. Lightweight plastic, cup-shaped, a torn foil closure flapping like an air brake. I pictured throwing one, hard. It would sail and stall in the air. It would travel ten feet, tops. A mile and a half of track, ten feet of shoulder, on the left, on the driver\u0027s side. I felt millions shrink to thousands. Then I felt them expand all the way back up to billions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good news and bad news,\" I said. \"I think you\u0027re right, so you\u0027ve cut the search area down by about ninety-nine percent. Maybe more. Which is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he was in a vehicle, did he throw it out at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have just dropped it on the floor,\" I said. \"Or chucked it in the back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if it was a pool vehicle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So maybe he put it in a sidewalk trash can later, after he parked. Or maybe he took it home with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. It\u0027s a fifty-fifty situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventy-thirty at best,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should look anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Braced the palms of my hands on the windshield\u0027s header rail and vaulted down to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was January, and the conditions were pretty good. February would have been better. In a temperate northern hemisphere climate, vegetation dies right back in February. It gets as thin and sparse as it ever will. But January was OK. The undergrowth was low and the ground was flat and brown. It was the color of dead bracken and leaf litter. There was no snow. The landscape was even and neutral and organic. It was a good background. I figured a container for a dairy product would be bright white. Or cream. Or maybe pink, for a strawberry or a raspberry flavor. Whatever, it would be a helpful color. It wouldn\u0027t be black, for instance. Nobody puts a dairy product in a black container. So if it was there and we came close to it, we would find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe checked a ten-foot belt all around the perimeter of the crime scene. Found nothing. So we went back to the track and set off north and east along it. Summer walked five feet from the track\u0027s left-hand edge. I walked five feet to her left. If we both scanned both ways we would cover a fifteen-foot strip, with two pairs of eyes on the crucial five-foot lane between us, which is exactly where the container should have landed, according to my aerodynamic theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked slow, maybe half-speed. I used short paces and settled into a rhythm of moving my head from one side to the other with every step. I felt pretty stupid doing it. I must have looked like a penguin. But it was an efficient method. I lapsed into a kind of autopilot mode and the ground blurred beneath me. I wasn\u0027t seeing individual leaves and twigs and blades of grass. I was tuning out what should be there. I felt like something that shouldn\u0027t be there would leap right out at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked for ten minutes and found nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swap?\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe changed places and moved on. We saw a million tons of forest debris, and nothing else. Army posts are kept scrupulously clean. The weekly litter patrol is a religion. Outside the wire we would have been tripping over all kinds of stuff. Inside, there was nothing. Nothing at all. We did another ten minutes, another three hundred yards, and then we paused and swapped positions again. Moving slow in the cold air was chilling me. I stared at the earth like a maniac. I felt we were close to our best chance. A mile and a half is 2,640 yards. I figured the first few hundred and the last few hundred were poor hunting grounds. At first the guy would have been feeling the pure urge to escape. Then close to the post buildings he knew he had to be ready and done and composed. So the middle stretch was where he would have sanitized. Anyone with any sense would have coasted to a stop, breathed in, breathed out, and thought things through. He would have buzzed his window down and felt the night air on his face. I slowed down and looked harder, left and right, left and right. Saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he have blood on him?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little, maybe,\" Summer said, on my right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look at her. I kept my eyes on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On his gloves,\" she said. \"Maybe on his shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Less than he might have expected,\" I said. \"Unless he was a doctor he would have expected some pretty bad bleeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he didn\u0027t use a pool car. He expected blood and didn\u0027t want to risk leaving it all over a vehicle that someone else was going to drive the next day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So like you said, with his own car, he\u0027ll have thrown it in the back. So we aren\u0027t going to find anything out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Said nothing. Walked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe covered the whole of the middle section and found nothing. Two thousand yards of dormant organic material and not one single man-made item. Not a cigarette butt, not a scrap of paper, no rusted cans, no empty bottles. It was a real tribute to the post commander\u0027s enthusiasm. But it was disappointing. We stopped with the main post buildings clearly visible, three hundred yards in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to backtrack,\" I said. \"I want to do the middle part again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said. \"About-face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and we switched positions. We decided we would cover each three-hundred-yard section the opposite way around from the first pass. Where I had walked inboard, I would walk outboard, and vice versa. No real reason, except our perspectives were different and we felt we should alternate. I was more than a foot taller than she was, and therefore simple trigonometry meant I could see more than a foot farther in either direction. She was closer to the ground and she claimed her eyes were good for detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked back, slow and steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing in the first section. We swapped positions. I took up station ten feet from the track. Scanned left and right. The wind was in our faces, and my eyes started watering from the cold. I put my hands in my pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing in the second section. We changed positions again. I walked five feet from the track, parallel to its edge. Nothing in the third section. We changed yet again. I did math in my head as we walked. So far we had swept a fifteen-foot swath along a 2,340-yard length. That made 11,700 square yards, which was a hair better than two-point-four acres. Nearly two and a half acres, out of a hundred thousand. Odds of forty thousand to one, approximately. Better than driving to town and spending a dollar on a lottery ticket. But not much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked on. The wind got stronger and we got colder. We saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was far to my right. Maybe twenty feet from me. Not a yogurt container. Something else. I almost ignored it because it was well outside the zone of possibility. No lightweight plastic unaerodynamic item could have gone that far after being thrown from a car on the track. So my eyes spotted it and my brain processed it and rejected it instantly, on a purely preprogrammed basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it hung up on it. Out of pure animal instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it looked like a snake. The lizard part of my brain whispered snake and I got that little primeval jolt of fright that had kept my ancestors alive and well way back in evolution. It was all over in a split second. It was smothered immediately. The modern educated part of my mind stepped in and said, No snakes here in January, bud. Way too cold. I breathed out and moved on a step and then paused to look back, purely out of curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a curved black shape in the dead grass. Belt? Garden hose? But it was settled deeper down among the stiff brown stalks than something made of leather or fabric or rubber could have fallen. It was right down there among the roots. Therefore it was heavy. And it had to be heavy to have traveled so far from the track. Therefore it was metal. Solid, not tubular. Therefore it was unfamiliar. Very little military equipment is curved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over. Got close. Knelt down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crowbar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black-painted crowbar, all matted on one end with blood and hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed with it and sent Summer to get the truck. She must have jogged all the way back for it because she returned sooner than I expected and out of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have an evidence bag?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not evidence,\" she said. \"Training accidents don\u0027t need evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not planning on taking it to court,\" I said. \"I just don\u0027t want to touch it, is all. Don\u0027t want my prints on it. That might give Willard ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked the back of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No evidence bags,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused. Normally you take exquisite care not to contaminate evidence with foreign prints and hairs and fibers, so as not to confuse the investigation. If you screw up, you can get your ass chewed by the prosecutors. But this time the motivation had to be different, with Willard in the mix. If I screwed up, I could get my ass sent to jail. Means, motive, opportunity, my prints on the weapon. Too good to be true. If the training accident story came back to bite him, he would jump all over anything he could get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could bring a specialist out here,\" Summer said. She was standing right behind me. I could sense her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t involve anyone else,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t even want to involve you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came around beside me and crouched low. Smoothed stalks of grass out of the way with her hands, for a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t planning to,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at it together, close up. It was a handheld wrecking bar forged from octagonal-section steel. It looked like a high-quality tool. It looked brand new. It was painted gloss black with the kind of paint people use on boats or cars. It was shaped a little like an alto saxophone. The main shaft was about three feet long, slightly S-shaped, and it had a shallow curve on one end and a full curve on the other, the shape of a capital letter J. Both tips were flattened and notched into claws, ready for levering nails out of planks of wood. Its design was streamlined and evolved, and simple, and brutal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly used,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never used,\" I said. \"Not for construction, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t need to print it,\" I said. \"We can assume the guy was wearing gloves when he swung it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer stood up next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t need to type the blood either,\" she said. \"We can assume it\u0027s Carbone\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could just leave it here,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"We can\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent down and untied my right boot. Pulled the lace all the way out and used a reef knot to tie the ends together. That gave me a closed loop about fifteen inches in diameter. I draped it over my right palm and dragged the free end across the dead stubble until I snagged it under the crowbar\u0027s tip. Then I closed my fist and lifted the heavy steel weight carefully out of the grass. I held it up, like a proud angler with a fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI limped around to the front passenger seat with the crowbar swinging gently in midair and my boot half off. I sat close to the transmission tunnel and steadied the crowbar against the floor just enough to stop it touching my legs as the vehicle moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\" Summer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mortuary,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping the pathologist and his staff would be out eating breakfast, but they weren\u0027t. They were all in the building, working. The pathologist himself caught us in the lobby. He was on his way somewhere with a file in his hand. He looked at us and then he looked at the trophy dangling from my boot lace. Took him half of a second to understand what it was, and the other half to realize it put us all in a very awkward situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could come back later,\" I said. When you\u0027re not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll go to my office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led the way. I watched him walk. He was a small dark man with short legs, brisk, competent, a little older than me. He seemed nice enough. And I guessed he wasn\u0027t stupid. Very few medics are. They have all kinds of complicated stuff to learn, before they get to be where they want to be. And I guessed he wasn\u0027t unethical. Very few medics were that either, in my experience. They\u0027re scientists at heart, and scientists generally retain a good-faith interest in facts and the truth. Or at least they retain some kind of innate curiosity. All of which was good, because this guy\u0027s attitude was going to be crucial. He could stay out of our way, or he could sell us out with a single phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis office was a plain square room full of original-issue gray steel desks and file cabinets. It was crowded. There were framed diplomas on the walls. There were shelves full of books and manuals. No specimen jars. No weird stuff pickled in formaldehyde. It could have been an army lawyer\u0027s office, except the diplomas were from medical schools, not law schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down in his rolling chair. Placed his file on his desk. Summer closed his door and leant on it. I stood in the middle of the floor, with the crowbar hanging in space. We all looked at each other. Waited to see who would make the opening bid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carbone was a training accident,\" the doctor said, like he was moving his first pawn two squares forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question,\" I said, like I was moving my own pawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad we\u0027ve got that straight,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he said it in a voice that meant: Can you believe this shit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Summer breathe out, because we had an ally. But we had an ally who wanted distance. We had an ally who wanted to hide behind an elaborate charade. And I didn\u0027t altogether blame him. He owed years of service in exchange for his medical school tuition. Therefore he was cautious. Therefore he was an ally whose wishes we had to respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carbone fell and hit his head,\" I said. \"It\u0027s a closed case. Pure accident, very unfortunate for all concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the crowbar a little higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think this is what he hit his head on,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he bounced. Maybe there were dead twigs under the leaves, made the ground a little springy, like a trampoline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor nodded. \"Terrain can be like that, this time of year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lethal,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered the crowbar again. Waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you bring it here?\" the doctor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There might be an issue of contributory negligence,\" I said. \"Whoever left it lying around for Carbone to fall on might need a reprimand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor nodded again. \"Littering is a grave offense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this man\u0027s army,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I said. \"We\u0027re here to help you out, is all. With it being a closed case, we figured you wouldn\u0027t want to clutter your place up with those plaster casts you made. Of the wound site. We figured we could haul them to the trash for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor nodded for a third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could do that,\" he said. \"It would save me a trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused for a long moment. Then he cleared the file away from in front of him and opened some drawers and laid sheets of clean white paper on the desktop and arranged half-a-dozen glass microscope slides on the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That thing looks heavy,\" he said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should put it down. Take the weight off your shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that medical advice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want ligament damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where should I put it down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any flat surface you can find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped forward and laid the crowbar gently on his desk, on top of the paper and the glass slides. Unhooked my boot lace and picked the knot out of it. Squatted down and threaded it back through all the eyelets. Tightened it up and tied it off. I looked up in time to see the doctor move a microscope slide. He picked it up and scraped it against the end of the crowbar where it was matted with blood and hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" he said. \"I got this slide all dirty. Very careless of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made the exact same error with five more slides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we interested in fingerprints?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"We\u0027re assuming gloves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should check, I think. Contributory negligence is a serious matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened another drawer and peeled a latex glove out of a box and snapped it on his hand. It made a tiny cloud of talcum dust. Then he picked the crowbar up and carried it out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came back less than ten minutes later. He still had his glove on. The crowbar was washed clean. The black paint gleamed. It looked indistinguishable from new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No prints,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the crowbar down on his chair and pulled a file drawer and came out with a plain brown cardboard box. Opened it up and took out two chalk-white plaster casts. Both were about six inches long and both had Carbone handwritten in black ink on the underside. One was a positive, formed by pressing wet plaster into the wound. The other was a negative, formed by molding more plaster over the positive. The negative showed the shape of the wound the weapon had made, and therefore the positive showed the shape of the weapon itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor put the positive on the chair next to the crowbar. Lined them up, parallel. The cast was about six inches long. It was white and a little pitted from the molding process but was otherwise identical to the smooth black iron. Absolutely identical. Same section, same thickness, same contours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the doctor put the negative on the desk. It was a little bigger than the positive, and a little messier. It was an exact replica of the back of Carbone\u0027s shattered skull. The doctor picked up the crowbar. Hefted it in his hand. Lined it up, speculatively. Brought it down, very slowly, one, for the first blow, then two for the second. Then three for the last. He touched it to the plaster. The third and final wound was the best defined. It was a clear three-quarter-inch trench in the plaster, and the crowbar fitted it perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check the blood and the hair,\" the doctor said. \"Not that we don\u0027t already know what the results will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the crowbar out of the plaster and tried it again. It went in again, precisely, and deep. He lifted it out and balanced it across his open palms, like he was weighing it. Then he grasped it by the straighter end and swung it, like a batter going after a high fastball. He swung it again, harder, a compact, violent stroke. It looked big in his hands. Big, and a little heavy for him. A little out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very strong man,\" he said. \"Vicious swing. Big tall guy, right-handed, physically very fit. But that describes a lot of people on this post, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no guy,\" I said. \"Carbone fell and hit his head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor smiled briefly and balanced the bar across his palms again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s handsome, in its way,\" he said. \"Does that sound strange?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he meant. It was a nice piece of steel, and it was everything it needed to be and nothing it didn\u0027t. Like a Colt Detective Special, or a K-bar, or a cockroach. He slid it inside a long steel drawer. The metals scraped one on the other and then boomed faintly when he let it go and dropped it the final inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep it here,\" he said. \"If you like. Safer that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you right-handed?\" he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colonel Willard told me you did it,\" he said. \"But I didn\u0027t believe him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were very surprised when you saw who it was. When I put his face back on. You had a definite physical reaction. People can\u0027t fake that sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell Willard that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor nodded. \"He found it inconvenient. But it didn\u0027t really deflect him. And I\u0027m sure he\u0027s already developed a theory to explain it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll watch my back,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some Delta sergeants came to see me too. There are rumors starting. I think you should watch your back very carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I plan to,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very carefully,\" the doctor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer and I got back in the Humvee. She fired it up and put it in gear and sat with her foot on the brake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quartermaster,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t military issue,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked expensive,\" I said. \"Expensive enough for the Pentagon, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have been green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Probably. But we should still check. Sooner or later we\u0027re going to need all our ducks in a row.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her foot off the brake and headed for the quartermaster building. She had been at Bird much longer than me and she knew where everything was. She parked again in front of the usual type of warehouse. I knew there would be a long counter inside with massive off-limits storage areas behind it. There would be huge bales of clothing, tires, blankets, mess kits, entrenching tools, equipment of every kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went in and found a young guy in new BDUs behind the counter. He was a cheerful corn-fed country boy. He looked like he was working in his dad\u0027s hardware store, and he looked like it was his life\u0027s ambition. He was enthusiastic. I told him we were interested in construction equipment. He opened a manual the size of eight phone books. Found the correct section. I asked him to find listings for crowbars. He licked his forefinger and turned pages and found two entries. Prybar, general issue, long, claw on one end and then crowbar, general issue, short, claw on both ends. I asked him to show us an example of the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid went away and disappeared among the tall stacks. We waited. Breathed in the unique quartermaster smell of old dust and new rubber and damp cotton twill. He came back after five long minutes with a GI crowbar. Laid it down on the counter in front of us. It landed with a heavy thump. Summer had been right. It was painted olive green. And it was a completely different item than the one we had just left in the pathologist\u0027s office. Different section, six inches shorter, slightly thinner, slightly different curves. It looked carefully designed. It was probably a perfect example of the way the army does things. Years ago it had probably been the ninety-ninth item on someone\u0027s reequipment agenda. A subcommittee would have been formed, with expert input from survivors of the old construction battalions. A specification would have been drawn up concerning length and weight and durability. Metal fatigue would have been investigated. Arenas of likely use would have been considered. Brittleness in the frozen winters of northern Europe would have been evaluated. Malleability in the severe heat of the equator would have been taken into account. Detailed drawings would have been made. Then tenders would have gone out. Mills all over Pennsylvania and Alabama would have priced the job. Prototypes would have been forged. They would have been tested, exhaustively. One and only one winner would have been approved. Paint would have been supplied, and the thickness and uniformity of its application would have been specified and carefully monitored. Then the whole business would have been completely forgotten. But the product of all those long months of deliberation was still coming through, thousands of units a year, needed or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, soldier,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to take it?\" the kid asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just needed to see it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went back to my office. It was midmorning, a dull day, and I felt aimless. So far, the new decade wasn\u0027t doing much for me. I wasn\u0027t a huge fan of the 1990s yet, at that point, six days in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to write the accident report?\" Summer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Willard? Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll expect it today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But I\u0027m going to make him ask, one more time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess because it\u0027s a fascinating experience. Like watching maggots writhing around in something that died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My enthusiasm for getting out of bed in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One bad apple,\" she said. \"Doesn\u0027t mean much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. \"If it is just one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crowbars,\" I said. \"We\u0027ve got two separate cases with crowbars, and I don\u0027t like coincidences. But I can\u0027t see how they can be connected. There\u0027s no way to join them up. Carbone was a million miles from Mrs. Kramer, in every way imaginable. They were in completely different worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vassell and Coomer join them up,\" she said. \"They had an interest in something that could have been in Mrs. Kramer\u0027s house, and they were here at Bird the night Carbone was murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s driving me crazy. It\u0027s a perfect connection, except it isn\u0027t. They took one call in D.C., they were too far from Green Valley to do anything to Mrs. Kramer themselves, and they didn\u0027t call anyone from the hotel. Then they were here the night Carbone died, but they were in the O Club with a dozen witnesses the whole time, eating steak and fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First time they were here, they had a driver. Major Marshall, remember? But the second time, they were on their own. That feels a little clandestine to me. Like they were here for a secret reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing very secret about hanging around in the O Club bar and then eating in the O Club dining room. They weren\u0027t out of sight for a minute, all night long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why didn\u0027t they have their driver? Why come on their own? I assume Marshall was at the funeral with them. But then they chose to drive more than three hundred miles by themselves? And more than three hundred back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Marshall was unavailable,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall\u0027s their blue-eyed boy,\" she said. \"He\u0027s available when they say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did they come here at all? It\u0027s a very long way for a very average dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They came for the briefcase, Reacher. Norton\u0027s wrong. She must be. Someone gave it to them. They left with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think Norton\u0027s wrong. She convinced me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe they picked it up in the parking lot. Norton wouldn\u0027t have seen that. I assume she didn\u0027t go out there in the cold and wave them off. But they left with it, for sure. Why else would they be happy to fly back to Germany?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they just gave up on it. They were due back in Germany anyway. They couldn\u0027t stay here forever. They\u0027ve got Kramer\u0027s command to fight over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" I said. \"There\u0027s no possible connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a random universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"So they stay on the back burner. Carbone stays on the front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going back out to look for the yogurt pot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"It\u0027s in the guy\u0027s car, or in his trash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could have been useful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll work with the crowbar instead. It\u0027s brand new. It was probably bought just as recently as the yogurt was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no resources.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Clark up in Green Valley will do it for us. He\u0027s already looking for his crowbar, presumably. He\u0027ll be canvassing hardware stores. We\u0027ll ask him to widen his radius and stretch his time frame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a lot of extra work for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"We\u0027ll have to offer him something. We\u0027ll have to string him along. We\u0027ll tell him we\u0027re working on something that might help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"We could fake it. We could give him Andrea Norton\u0027s name. We could show her exactly what kind of a family we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Detective Clark. I didn\u0027t give him Andrea Norton\u0027s name. I told him a few lies instead. I told him I recalled the damage to Mrs. Kramer\u0027s door, and the damage to her head, and that I figured a crowbar was involved, and I told him that as it happened we had a rash of break-ins at military installations all up and down the Eastern seaboard that also seemed to involve crowbars, and I asked him if we could piggyback on the legwork he was undoubtedly already doing in terms of tracing the Green Valley weapon. He paused at that point, and I filled the silence by telling him that military quartermasters currently had no crowbars on general issue and therefore I was convinced our bad guys had used a civilian source of supply. I gave him some guff about not wanting to duplicate his efforts because we had a more promising line of inquiry to spend our time on. He paused again at that point, like cops everywhere, waiting to hear the proffered quid pro quo. I told him that as soon as we had a name or a profile or a description he would have it too, just as fast as stuff can travel down a fax line. He perked up then. Clark was a desperate man, staring at a brick wall. He asked what exactly I wanted. I told him it would be helpful to us if he could expand his canvass to a three-hundred-mile radius around Green Valley, and check hardware store purchases during a window that started late on New Year\u0027s Eve and extended through, say, January fourth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your promising line of inquiry?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There might be a military connection with Mrs. Kramer. We might be able to give you the guy on a plate all tied up with a bow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d really like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cooperation,\" I said. \"Makes the world go around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure does,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded happy. He bought the whole bill of goods. He promised to expand his search and copy me in. I hung up the phone and it rang again immediately. I picked it up and heard a woman\u0027s voice. It sounded warm and intimate and Southern. It asked me to 10- 33 a 10-16 from the MP XO at Fort Jackson, which meant Please stand by to take a secure landline call from your opposite number in South Carolina. I waited with the phone by my ear and heard an empty electronic hiss for a moment. Then there was a loud click and my oppo in South Carolina came on and told me I should know that Colonel David C. Brubaker, Fort Bird\u0027s Special Forces CO, had been found that morning with two bullets in his head in an alley in a crummy district of Columbia, which was South Carolina\u0027s capital city, and which was all of two hundred miles from the North Carolina golf course hotel where he had been spending his holiday furlough with his wife. And according to the local paramedics he had been dead for a day or two. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-13.html","bookId":2346,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:33 AM"}
