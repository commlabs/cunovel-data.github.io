Small-boned woman, white hair, sweet- faced, starched white apron. (Grandmother of Jasmine.) Deeply troubled. \"Now, don\u0027t you just grab for all this, I\u0027ve got it folded!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood back to let her march into the room and lay the pile on the flower-strewn bed. \"Now, there\u0027s underwear and slips here, too,\" she declared. She shook her head. The shower was running in the bath. She passed me as she went out, making her share of little grumbling noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe that girl is still breathing,\" she said. \"It\u0027s some kind of miracle. And her family down there brought Fr. Kevin with the Holy Oils. Now, I know Quinn loves that girl, but where does it say in the Gospel that you have to let a person die in your house, and what with Quinn\u0027s mother sick, you knew that didn\u0027t you, and Quinn\u0027s mother run off somewhere, did you know that, Patsy\u0027s up and gone-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Flash on memory of Patsy, Quinn\u0027s mother: country-western singer with poofed hair and painted fingernails, dying of AIDS in the bedroom opposite, no longer up to putting on her fringed leather outfits with the high boots and war paint makeup and going out, just pretty on the couch in white nightgowns when I had last seen her, lady full of irrational and overriding hate for Quinn, a twisted kind of sibling rivalry from a woman who\u0027d been sixteen when Quinn was born to her. Now vanished.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-and leaving all her medicine behind, sick as she is. Oh Patsy, Patsy, and Aunt Queen just laid in the grave, and then this redheaded child coming here, I\u0027m telling you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe Mona\u0027s dead,\" I said, \"and Quinn\u0027s washing her corpse in the bathtub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke into laughter, muffling it with her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027re a devil,\" she said. \"You\u0027re worse than Quinn,\" she went on flashing her pale eyes at me, \"but don\u0027t you think I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing in that shower together. And what if she does die in there, what about that, are we going to be patting her dry with towels and laying her out like it didn\u0027t happen and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she\u0027ll be really clean,\" I said with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, trying not to laugh out loud, and then shifted emotional gears as she headed back to the hall, laughing and talking to nobody as she went on, \". . . and what with his mother running off, and she sick as a dog, and nobody knows where she is, and those Mayfairs downstairs, it\u0027s a wonder they didn\u0027t bring the sheriff.\" And into the back bedroom she went, The Angel of Hot Coffee, where Nash and Tommy talked in hushed voices, and Tommy cried over the loss of Aunt Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to me with uncommon strength that I had grown too fond of all these people, that I understood why Quinn insisted on remaining here, playing the mortal as long as he could, why the entirety of Blackwood Farm had a hold on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was time to be a wizard. Time to buy some time for Mona, time to make her absence somehow acceptable to the witches below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, I was curious about the creatures in the double parlor, these intrepid psychics who fooled the mortals around them as surely as we vampires did, pretending to be wholesome and regular human beings while they contained a host of secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried down the circular stairs, grabbed up tiny Jerome with his big tennis shoes off the banister just in time to save his life as he nearly fell some ten feet to the marble tile floor below, and put him in the waiting arms of a very anxious Jasmine; and then, gesturing to her that everything would be all right, I went into the cooler air of the front room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Rowan Mayfair, founder and head of Mayfair Medical, was seated in one of the mahogany chairs (picture nineteenth-century Rococo, black lacquer and velvet), and her head turned sharply as if jerked by a cord when I entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we had seen each other before, as I noted, at Aunt Queen\u0027s funeral Mass in St. Mary\u0027s Assumption Church. In fact, I\u0027d sat dangerously close to her, being in the pew right in front of her. But I\u0027d been better camouflaged at the time by ordinary clothes and sunglasses. What she saw now was the Brat Prince in his frock coat and handmade lace, and I\u0027d forgotten to put on my sunglasses, which was just a stupid mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t had a really good look at her at all. Now I found myself instantly fascinated, which wasn\u0027t too comfortable since it was my role to fascinate as our conversation went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lean oval face was delicately sculpted and as clean as a little girl\u0027s and needed nothing in the way of paint to make it remarkable, with its huge gray eyes and cold flawless mouth. She wore a severe, gray wool pants suit, with a red scarf wrapped around her neck and tucked down into her lapels, and her short ash blond hair appeared to curl under naturally just below the soft line of her jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression was intensely dramatic, and I sensed an immediate and sweeping probe of my mind, which I locked up tight. I felt chills down my backbone. She was creating this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had fully expected to read my thoughts and she couldn\u0027t. And she was blocked from knowing what was going on upstairs. She didn\u0027t like it. But to put it more Biblically, she was deeply grieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd being shut out, she tried to make sense of my appearance, not at all concerned with the superficial eccentricity of the frock coat and my messy hair, but of elements which were more purely vampiric-the subtle sheen of my skin and the electric blue of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to start talking quickly, but let me fill you in first on my instantaneous take on the other Mayfair-Fr. Kevin-who was standing at the far mantel, the only other occupant of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNature had dealt him the same cards as Mona-deep green eyes and red hair. In fact, he could have been her big brother, the genes were so close, and he was my height, six feet, and well built. He wore clerical black with the white Roman collar. And he was not the witch Rowan was, but he was more than slightly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epsychic, and I could read him easily: he thought I was weird and he was hoping Mona was already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sparked off the memory of him at Mass in his Gothic robes holding the chalice in his hands.This is my blood. And for reasons I couldn\u0027t possibly explain, I was taken slap back to my village childhood in France, to the ancient church and the village priest saying those very same words, chalice in hand, and for a moment I lost my perspective on everything. Other mortal memories threatened, perfected in color and lucidity. I saw the monastery where I\u0027d studied, so happy, where I\u0027d so wanted to be a monk. Oh, this was sickening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with another decided chill, I realized that Dr. Mayfair had caught these images out of my mind before I closed it up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook it off, annoyed for a moment that the double parlor was so crowded with shadow. Then my eyes latched on to the stark, don\u0027t belong, figure of Oncle Julien, three-dimensional and exquisitely solid in a slim gray suit, standing in the far corner, arms folded, eying me with calculating opposition. He was fiercely actual, and fiercely bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Dr. Rowan Mayfair asked. Her voice was deep, husky and sensual. Her eyes were still picking me apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t see any ghost in here, do you?\" I blurted out without thinking, the ghost just standing there all the while as it came clear to me that of course they didn\u0027t, neither of them. This shining and self- contained menace had it in for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t see anything,\" Rowan answered promptly. \"There\u0027s a ghost in this room that I ought to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen with these husky voices have a miraculous advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do have your ghosts here,\" Fr. Kevin said acceptingly. Yankee accent. Boston. \"As Quinn\u0027s friend, I thought you\u0027d know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I do, yes,\" I said. \"But I never get used to them. Ghosts scare me. So do angels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And didn\u0027t you hold an exorcism to get rid of Goblin?\" asked the priest, throwing me off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and it worked,\" I said, glad of the distraction. \"Goblin\u0027s gone from this house, and Quinn\u0027s free of him for the first time in his life. I wonder what it will mean to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOncle Julien didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" asked Rowan, meaning Mona, who else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants to stay here,\" I said. \"You know, it\u0027s simple.\" I crossed in front of her and sat down in a chair with its back to the floor lamp, putting myself in a bit of shadow, and so I could see everyone, even my nemesis. \"She doesn\u0027t want to die at Mayfair Medical. She managed to drive the limousine all the way over here. You know Mona. And she\u0027s with Quinn upstairs. I want you to trust us. Leave her with us. We\u0027ll take care of her. We can call Aunt Queen\u0027s old nurse to help us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan was staring at me as if I\u0027d lost my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you realize how difficult it\u0027s going to be?\" she asked. She sighed and a great weariness showed itself in her, but only for an instant. \"Do you realize how difficult it can get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve brought the oxygen and morphine, haven\u0027t you?\" I glanced over my shoulder in the direction of the ambulance out front. \"Leave them. Cindy, the nurse, will know how to use them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan raised her eyebrows. Same weariness again, but her strength was greater. She was trying to figure me out. Absolutely nothing about me frightened her or repelled her. I found her beautiful. There was a limitless intelligence behind her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn can\u0027t possibly understand what he\u0027s taking on,\" she said gently. \"I don\u0027t want him to be hurt. I don\u0027t want her to die in pain. Do you follow me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do,\" I said. \"Trust me that we\u0027ll call you when it\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bowed her head, but only for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, you don\u0027t understand,\" she said, the husky voice so expressive of concern. \"There\u0027s no reasonable explanation for her being still alive right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s her will,\" I countered. I\u0027m telling you the truth, there is no reason to be concerned for her. \"She\u0027s resting, free of pain,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible,\" Rowan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered in her expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" she asked, that deep voice underscoring her seriousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was the one being spellbound. I couldn\u0027t break loose of her. I felt the chills again. The room was too dim. I wanted to tell Jasmine to turn up the chandelier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said, but it was hard for me to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it about this woman? Why was her strip down beauty so provocative and threatening? I wanted to see into her soul but she was far too clever to let it happen. Yet I sensed secrets in her, a trove of them, and I felt an electric connection to the monster child that Mona had revealed to me when I made her, and other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew suddenly this woman was hiding something dreadful to her own conscience, that the dominant note of her character was this concealment and this conscience, and a great striving rooted in her brilliance and her guilt. I wanted it, whatever she was hiding, just to know it for a moment, just to know it in warmth with her. I would have given anything-.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away from me. I had unwittingly stared her down and lost her, and she was fumbling silently, and I almost saw it: a power over life and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFr. Kevin spoke up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to see Mona before we go,\" he said. \"I must talk to Quinn, about the exorcism. I used to see Goblin, you understand. I\u0027m concerned for both of them. You have to tell Mona we\u0027re here-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had taken a chair opposite me and I hadn\u0027t even noticed. \"Perhaps we should both see her,\" he said to Rowan. \"Then we can decide what to do.\" His was a gentle voice, perfect for a priest, humble yet totally unaffected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI locked eyes with him, and it seemed for an instant I caught hold of shared secrets, things that they all knew, these Mayfairs, things they couldn\u0027t tell, things so profoundly connected to their wealth and their roots that they could never be outgrown or expurgated or overcome. With Fr. Kevin it was doubly hard because he was the confessor of this family, bound by that sacred oath, and also he\u0027d been told things he could scarce believe and it had profoundly changed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he too knew how to lock his mind. And again, all I got when I probed him was that aching memory of my own childhood schooling, of my wanting so badly to be good. An echo of my own mental voice coming back on me. I hated it. Away with it! It struck me, sharp and hard, that I had been given so many chances to save my soul that my entire life had been constructed around these chances! That was my nature-going from temptation after temptation, not to sin, but to be redeemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never seen my life that way before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad that long-ago boy, Lestat, fought hard enough, he could have become a monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accursed!\" whispered the ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not possible,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not possible to see her!\" Rowan said. \"You can\u0027t be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a soft laughter. I turned around in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my far right the ghost was laughing. \"Now what are you going to do, Lestat?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" asked Rowan. \"What are you seeing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I insisted. \"You can\u0027t see her. I promised her. No one would come up. For God\u0027s sakes, let her alone.\" I threw all my conviction behind it. I suddenly felt desperate. \"Let her die the way she wants, for the love of Heaven. Let her go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at me, glared at this display of emotion. An immense inner suffering was suddenly visible in her face, as if she could no longer conceal it, or as if my own outburst, muted as it had been, had ignited the dim fire inside of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" said Fr. Kevin. \"But you understand, we have to stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s not going to be very long,\" said Rowan. \"We\u0027ll wait quietly. If you don\u0027t want us in the house . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, of course you\u0027re welcome,\" I said.\"Mon Dieu!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain came the ghostly laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your hospitality is wretched!\" said Oncle Julien. \"Jasmine has not even offered them a cracker and glass of water. I am appalled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was bitterly amused by that, and I doubted the truth of it. I found myself worrying about it and became incensed! And at the same time I heard something, something nobody in the room could hear, except perhaps the laughing ghost. It was the sound of Mona crying, nay, sobbing. I had to go back to Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, Lestat, be a monster. Throw the most interesting woman you\u0027ve ever met out of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, both of you,\" I said, fixing Rowan in my gaze, and then flashing on Fr. Kevin. \"I want you to go home. Mona\u0027s as psychic as you are. It distresses her dreadfully that you\u0027re down here. She senses it. She feels it. It adds to her pain.\" (All this was true, wasn\u0027t it?) \"I gotta go back up there now and comfort her. Please leave. That\u0027s what she wants. That\u0027s what gave her the strength to drive here. Now I promise you I will contact you when it\u0027s all over. Please go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose, and I took Rowan\u0027s arm and all but lifted her out of the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a perfect lout,\" said the ghost, disgustedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFr. Kevin was on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan stared at me, transfixed. I guided her into the hallway and to the front door, and the priest followed.Trust in me. Trust that it\u0027s what Mona wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould they hear Mona\u0027s sobs now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout taking my eyes off Rowan\u0027s eyes, I opened the front door. Blast of summer heat, scent of flowers. \"You go now,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the oxygen, the morphine,\" said Rowan. Whiskey voice, they called it. It was so seductive. And behind her delicate probing frown was this conflict, this unadmitted and sinful power. What was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood on the front porch, like dwarves underneath the columns. The purple light was suddenly soothing and the moment lost its proportions. It was like eternal dusk here in the country. I could hear the birds of the night, the distant unquiet waters of the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFr. Kevin instructed the orderlies. They brought in the supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t break away from this woman. What had I been saying to her? The ghost was laughing. I was getting confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is your secret?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a physical push, as though she had stretched out her two hands and laid them on my chest and tried to move me back from where I stood. I saw the ghost over her shoulder. It came from her, the push. It had to come from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was engraved with a hostile beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tossed her hair just slightly, let it stroke her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe narrowed her eyes. \"Take care of Mona for me,\" she said. \"I love her with all my heart. You cannot know what it means to me that I failed with her-that all my gifts, all my resources-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I know how you love her,\" I said. \"I love her and I hardly know her.\" This was babble. This woman was suffering. Was I suffering? The ghost was accusing me. A tall man right behind her but she had no sense of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it that was slipping out of her conscious to me? Something so very dreadful that it had shaped her entire existence; and she felt it keenly at this moment. I have taken life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. Her eyes wouldn\u0027t let me move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have taken life again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orderlies swept by with more equipment. Cool air flooded out of the open front door. Jasmine was there. The ghost stood firm. It seemed to me that the curve of the limbs of the pecan trees marching down the gravel drive meant something, a secret communication from the Lord of the Universe, but what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to me,\" I said to Rowan. A life founded upon suffering, upon reparation. I couldn\u0027t bear it, I had to touch it, enclose it, save it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her in my arms, Dear God Forgive Me, kissing her cheeks and then her mouth. Don\u0027t fear for Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" she whispered. In a scalding moment I saw the hospital room, a torture cell of machines and pulsing numbers, glistening plastic bags feeding into dangling tubes, and Mona sobbing, sobbing the way she was now, and Rowan standing in the doorway.Almost used the power, almost killed-.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see, I do,\" I said. \"And it was not the right time and she wanted to come to Quinn,\" I whispered the words in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, her own tears rising, \"and I frightened her. You see. She knew what I meant to do, she knew I had the power, it would have showed up as a stroke on the autopsy, just a stroke, but she knew! I almost. . . . I terrified her. And. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held her so tight. I drew in my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her tears. I wished I was a saint. I wished I was the priest who stood by the car waiting for her, pretending not to see our kissing. What was kissing? Mortal kissing? I kissed her mouth again. Mortal loving and all the while the thundering desire for the link of the blood, not her death, no, Dear God, no, just the link of the blood, the knowing. Who was this Rowan Mayfair! My head swam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the ghost beyond her glared as though he\u0027d harrow Hell to bring its forces against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you tell when was the right moment?\" I answered. \"And the thing to cling to is that you didn\u0027t do it. And now she has her time with Quinn.\" Oh, such deceitful euphemisms for one who detests all euphemisms, and with reason. I kissed her hard and eagerly and felt her body soften, felt her lock to me for one precious instant, and then the flash of icy coldness as she pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried down the steps, her heels barely making a sound. Fr. Kevin was holding the door of the car open for her. The ambulance was already backing up. She turned and looked at me and then she waved at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a tender, unexpected gesture. I felt my heart grow huge, and its beating too much for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you poor darling. You didn\u0027t kill her. I did it. I killed her. I\u0027m guilty. And she\u0027s sobbing again. And the ghost knows. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-4.html","bookId":2596,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
