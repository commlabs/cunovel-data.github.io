Thirty years have gone by since the darkness descended and the Black Harvest began, a time when a serial killer sheared a bloody swath through the quiet Pennsylvania village. The evil that once coursed through Pine Deep has been replaced by cheerful tourists getting ready to enjoy the country\u0027s largest Halloween celebration in what is now called \"The Spookiest Town in America.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt Just Grows Stronger \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut then--a month before Halloween--it begins. Unspeakably desecrated bodies. Inexplicable insanity. And an ancient evil walking the streets, drawing in those who would fall to their own demons and seeking to shred the very soul of this rapidly fracturing community. Yes, the residents of Pine Deep have drawn together and faced a killer before. But this time, evil has many faces--and the lust and will to rule the earth. This struggle will be epic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ghost-road-blues-pine-deep-1.jpg","author":"Jonathan Maberry","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-road-blues-pine-deep-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:05 PM"}
