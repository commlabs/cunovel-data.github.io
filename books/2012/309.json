I acted within military law in this matter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That water,’ said Ruthan Gudd, ‘was doled out to the children of the Snake. By the Adjunct’s direct command.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct knew nothing about it, Captain Gudd, so what you’re saying makes no sense.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaradan Sort snorted. ‘We all knew about your stash, Blistig. We’ve just been waiting for you to make your move. But you can’t reclaim what was never yours in the first place, never mind that it’s now all gone. If there was any treason here, Blistig, it was yours.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sneered. ‘That’s where you’ve lost the track – all of you! All this “we’re in this together” rubbish – so that a lowly latrine digger gets the same portion as a Fist, or a captain, or the damned Adjunct herself – that’s not how the world is, and with good reason! It’s us highborn who’ve earned the greater portion. On account of our greater responsibilities, our greater skills and talents. That’s the order of the world, friends.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never knew you were highborn, Blistig,’ commented Faradan Sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man scowled. ‘There’s other paths to privilege, Sort. Look at you, after all, a deserter of the Wall, now here you are, a damned Fist. And Kindly here, straight up from the regular ranks, and that climb wasn’t exactly meteoric, was it? Decades of mediocrity, right, Kindly? You ended up just outlasting everyone else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Everything you’re saying, Blistig,’ said Ruthan Gudd, ‘is undermining your original argument. Seems there’s not one highborn among us here. In fact, only the Adjunct can make that claim.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A woman who betrayed her own class,’ Blistig said, with a cold grin. ‘Treason starts at the top when it comes to the Bonehunters.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You plan on killing everyone, then, Blistig?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kindly, turns out I don’t have to, do I? We’re finished. All those warnings have proved true. This desert can’t be crossed. We’ve failed. In every way, we’ve failed.’ He shook his head. ‘I did Pores a damned favour. I made it quick.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Expecting one of us to make it as quick for you?’ Ruthan Gudd asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig shrugged. ‘Why not? I don’t care any more. I really don’t. She’s already killed us all. Will it be your blade, Captain Gudd? Do me a favour – make it the icy one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No one will be killing you this night,’ Kindly said. He unclipped his sword belt and threw it to one side. ‘We bear these titles. Fists. Let’s find their original meaning, you and me, Blistig.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re joking, old man.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaradan Sort turned to Kindly in alarm. ‘What are you doing? Let’s just drag him up before the Adjunct. Kindly!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the man bulled forward. And Blistig moved to meet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men too weak to do any real damage to the other. The fight was pathetic. Punches that couldn’t break skin, blows that could barely bruise. Three or four exchanges and both men were kneeling three paces apart, gasping, heads held down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kindly looked up, Blistig threw sand into his eyes, lurched forward, grasped Kindly’s head and drove it down on to one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSort moved to intervene but Ruthan Gudd reached out and held her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact should have shattered Kindly’s nose, but it didn’t. He punched Blistig’s crotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man let out a strangled grunt, sagged down on to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKindly tried to get up, fell back down, and then rolled on to his back, eyes squeezed shut, his chest heaving for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s it,’ Ruthan Gudd said. ‘They’re done.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stupid!’ Faradan Sort snapped, pulling her arm out of Gudd’s grip. She went to stand over the two men. ‘What was the point? If the soldiers up there had seen this – you useless fools! Blistig, if we weren’t all of us about to die, I would kill you. But you don’t deserve that mercy – no, you’re going to suffer through this night just like everyone else.’ She turned. ‘Captain Raband, help your Fist.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig managed to work himself back on to his knees, and he slowly sat up. ‘She’s killed us all. For nothing.’ He moved his glare from one face to the next. ‘Aye, I see it in your eyes, every one of you, you ain’t got a thing to say to make it different. She’s killed us. You know it the same as me. So, you want to kill me? You want to do her work for her?’ He climbed, with difficulty, to his feet. ‘Give me the dignity of dying on my own.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-309.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
