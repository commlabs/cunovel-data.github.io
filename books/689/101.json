I was waiting till I could afford the luxury; but many a man has put off a bold action till he died, so I am publishing this book without being able to afford it. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The reason is that I do not want to be a writer for the rich. I want to be read by working-boys and girls, and by poor students.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I offer the book at a low price. In the hope of tempting you to go out and get your friends to read it, I have made a price in quantities which will allow no profit at all. A margin has been figured to cover postage, stationery, circulars, and the cost of a clerical assistant; but nothing for interest on capital, which is a gift, nor for the rent of an office, which is my home, nor for the services of manager and press agent, which is myself.\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3228/88270.html","bookId":689,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:14:54 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:14:54 AM"}
