She couldn\u0027t be sure of anything except that she was alive, that Stefan was gone, and that Damon was back to his old self again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe because we didn\u0027t have my precious brother,\" he said, as if to prove it. They were driving in the Ferrari, trying to find Elena\u0027s Jaguar - in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena ignored him. She also ignored the soft but vaguely annoying hiss that came from some device he\u0027d installed that was not a radio, that just seemed to play voices and static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new kind of Ouija board? Audio instead of all that tedious spelling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena felt herself shiver inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did give your word to go with me and find him. I swear it by - by the Other World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me that I did, and you\u0027re not a liar - no, not to me. I can read your facial expressions now that you\u0027re a human. If I gave my word, I gave my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman? Elena thought. Am I?What am I? - with the kind of Powers I have? Even Damon can see that the Old Wood has changed in the real world. It\u0027s not an ancient, half-dead forest anymore. There are spring flowers in midsummer. There\u0027s life everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in any case, it will give me plenty of time to be alone with you - my princess of darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we\u0027re back to that again, Elena thought wearily. But he\u0027d leave me here stranded if I once suggested that we had laughed and walked in a clearing together - with him on his knees to adjust my footstool. Even I\u0027m beginning to wonder if it was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight bump - as nearly as one could tell from Damon\u0027s style of driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it!\" he cheered himself - and then, when Elena turned, ready to wrench the wheel to make him stop - he added coolly, \"It was a piece oftire , for your information. Not many animals are black, arched, and a few tenths of an inch thick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena said nothing. What was there to say to Damon\u0027s quips? But deep down she felt relieved that Damon wasn\u0027t given to running over furry little animals as an amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to be alone together for quite some time, she thought - and then realized that there was another reason she couldn\u0027t just tell Damon to dry up and die. Shinichi had put the location of Stefan\u0027s cell into Damon\u0027s mind, not hers. She needed him desperately, to take her to the location, and to fight whoever was keeping Stefan captive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was fine if he had forgotten that she had any Powers. Something to save for a rainy day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt just that moment, Damon exclaimed \"What the - \" and leaned forward to adjust dials on the not-radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - peating; all units be on the lookout for one Matthew Honeycutt, male Caucasian, five foot eleven inches, blond hair, blue eyes - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"Elena demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A police scanner. If you want to be able to really live in this great land of freedom, it\u0027s best to know when to run - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon, don\u0027t get me started on your lifestyle. I meant what was that about Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks as if they\u0027ve decided to bring him in at last. Caroline didn\u0027t get much revenge yesterday night. I guess she\u0027s taking a shot at it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ve got to get to him first - anythingcould happen if he stays in Fell\u0027s Church. But he can\u0027t take his car, and he won\u0027t fit in this one. What are we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave him to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t, please. We have to - \" Elena was beginning, when in a clearing to the left, like some vision sent to approve her scheme, the Jaguar appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027sthe car we\u0027re taking,\" she told Damon flatly. \"At least it\u0027s roomy. If you want your police scanner doo-hickey in it, then you\u0027d better start uninstalling it from this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go get Matt. I\u0027m the only one he\u0027ll listen to. Then we\u0027ll leave the Ferrari in the Wood - or dump it in the creek if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the creek, byall means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, we may not have time for that. We\u0027ll just leave it in the Wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt stared at Elena. \"No. I won\u0027t run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena turned the full intensity of her blue eyes on him. \"Matt, get in the car.Now . You have to. Caroline\u0027s dad is related to the judge who signed the order to get you. It\u0027s a lynching, Meredith says. Even Meredith is telling you to run. No, you don\u0027t need clothes; we\u0027ll get clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - but - it\u0027s not true - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll make it true. Caroline will weep and sob. I never thought a girl would do this to get revenge, but Caroline is in a class of her own. She\u0027s gone nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, get in!They\u0027ll be here any minute. They\u0027ve already been to your house and Meredith\u0027s house. What are you doing at Bonnie\u0027s, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie and Matt glanced at each other. \"Uh, just having a look at Bonnie\u0027s mom\u0027s car,\" Matt said. \"It\u0027s on the fritz again, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind! Come with me! Bonnie, what are you doing? Calling Meredith back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie jumped slightly. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her good-bye and we love her and good-bye. Take care of the town - we\u0027ll be in touch - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the red Jaguar pulled away, Bonnie said into the phone, \"You were right. She\u0027s pulling a Straight A away. I don\u0027t know whether Damon\u0027s going - he wasn\u0027t in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened for a moment and then said, \"Okay, I will. I\u0027ll see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up and got into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Diary,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I ran away from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess you can\u0027t really call it running away when you\u0027re almost 18 and you take your own car - and when nobody knew you were home in the first place. So I\u0027ll just say, tonight I\u0027m on the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other slightly shocking thing is that I ran away with two different guys. And neither of them ismy guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say that, but...I can\u0027t help remembering things. The look in Matt\u0027s eyes in the clearing - I honestly think he was prepared to die to protect me. I can\u0027t help but think about what we once were to each other. Those blue eyes...oh, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Damon. I know now that there\u0027s living flesh under the layers and layers of stone he\u0027s wrapped around his soul. It\u0027s deeply hidden, but it\u0027s there. If I\u0027m being honest with myself, I have to admit that he touches something deep inside me that makes me shiver - a part of myself even I don\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Elena! Stop right now! You can\u0027t go near that dark part of yourself, especially now that you have Power. You don\u0027t dare go near it. Everything is different now. You have to be more responsible (something you\u0027re not at all good at!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Meredith won\u0027t be here to help me be responsible, either. How is this ever going to work out? Damon and Matt in the same car? On a road trip together? Can you imagine? Tonight, it was so late and Matt was so stunned by the situation that he couldn\u0027t really take anything in. And Damon only smirked. But he\u0027ll be in demonic form tomorrow, I know he will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still think it was a great pity that Shinichi had to takeWings of Redemption from Damon along with his memories. But I firmly believe that, deep down, there\u0027s a tiny part of Damon that remembers how he was when we were together. And now he has to be worse than ever to prove that what he remembers was all a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo while you\u0027re reading this,Damon - I know you\u0027ll get hold of it somehow and snoop - let me tell you that you were nice for a while, actuallyNICE,and it was fun. We talked together. We even laughed - at the same jokes. And you...you were gentle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now you\u0027re going, \"Nah, it\u0027s just another Elena-plot to get me to think I can turn around - butI know where I\u0027m going, and I don\u0027t care.\" Does that ring a bell, Damon? Have yousaid those words to someone recently? And if not, how do I know them? Could it be that for once I\u0027m telling the truth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m going to forget that you\u0027re totally besmirching your honor by reading secret things that don\u0027t belong to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst: I miss Stefan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond: I didn\u0027t really pack for this. Matt and I swung by the boardinghouse, and he grabbed the money Stefan left for me while I grabbed an armful of clothes out of the closet - heaven knows what I\u0027ve got: Bonnie\u0027s tops and Meredith\u0027s pants, and not a decent nightgown to my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at least I also got you, precious friend, a present Stefan was saving for me. I never really liked typing in a file marked \"Diary\" anyway. Blank books like you are my style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird: I miss Stefan. I miss him so badly that I\u0027m crying while I\u0027m writing about clothes. It looks as if that\u0027s what I\u0027m crying about, which makes me seem insanely shallow. Oh, sometimes I just want to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth: I want to screamnow.It was only when we got back to Fell\u0027s Church that we found what horrors the malach had left for us. There is a fourth little girl I think may be possessed like Tami, Kristin, and Ava - I couldn\u0027t really tell, so I couldn\u0027t do anything. I have the feeling that we definitely haven\u0027t heard the last of this possession thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifth: But worst is what happened in the Saitou house. Isobel is in the hospital with raging infections in all her piercings. Obaasan, as everyone calls Isobel\u0027s grandmother, was not dead as the first paramedics who got there thought. She was in a deep trance - reaching out tous . Whether some of the courage I got, some of the belief in myself, was really due to her, is something I\u0027ll never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the den was Jim Bryce. He had...oh, I can\u0027t write it. He was the captain of theb asketball team! But he hadeaten away at himself: his whole left hand, most of his right-hand fingers, his lips. And he had put a pencil through his ear into his brain. They say (I heard this through Tyrone Alpert, the doctor\u0027s grandson) that it\u0027s called Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (sp? I only heard it said) and that it\u0027s rare, but there are others just like him. That\u0027s what the doctors say. I say it was a malach making him do it. But they wouldn\u0027t let me in to try to take it out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t even say he\u0027s alive. I can\u0027t say if he\u0027s dead. He\u0027s going to a sort of institution where they keep long-term cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe failed there. I failed. It wasn\u0027t really Jim Bryce\u0027s fault. So he was with Caroline just one night, and from there he passed the malach to his girlfriend Isobel and to his little sister Tami. Then both Caroline and little Tami passed it along to others. They tried to give it to Matt, but he wasn\u0027t about to let them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixth, the three little girls that most definitely did get it were all under the orders of Misao, from what Shinichi said.They say that they don\u0027t remember anything about decorating themselves or propositioning strangers. They don\u0027t seem to remember anything about the time of their possession, and they act like very different little girls now. Nice. Calm. If I thought Misao gave up easily then I would be sure they\u0027ll be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse is the thought of Caroline. She was a friend once and now - well, now I think she needs help more than ever. Damon got toher diaries - she kept her own diary by recording herself on video, and we watched her talk to the mirror...and watched the mirror talk back. Mostly it was her own image that showed, but sometimes, at the beginning or end of a session, it was Shinichi\u0027s face. He\u0027s good-looking, if a little wild. I can see how Caroline might fall for him and agree to be his carrier of malach in the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all over. I used the last of whatever Power I know I have taking the malach out of those girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline, of course, wouldn\u0027t let me near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there were those fateful words of Caroline\u0027s: \"I need a husband!\" Any girl knows what that means. Any girl feels sorry for another who says it, even if they\u0027re unfriends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline and Tyler Smallwood were going together until about two weeks ago. Meredith says Caroline dropped him, and that kidnapping her for Klaus was Tyler\u0027s revenge. Butif before that they\u0027d been sleeping together with no protection (and Caroline is dumb enough to do it), she could certainly have known she was pregnant and been looking for another guy by the time Shinichi turned up. (Which was just before I - returned to life.) Now she\u0027s trying to pin it on Matt. It was pure bad luck that she said it happened on the same night the malach attacked Matt and that that old man from the Neighborhood Watch saw Matt drive home and pass out at the steering wheel as if he were drunk or on drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it wasn\u0027t just luck. Maybe that was all part of Misao\u0027s game, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to sleep now. Too much thinking. Too much worry. And, oh, I miss Stefan! He would help me deal with the worry in his own gentle but keen-sighted way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sleeping inside the car with the doors locked. The guys are sleeping outside it. At least, that\u0027s how we\u0027re starting - at their insistence. At least they agreed on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think Shinichi and Misao will stay away from Fell\u0027s Church for long. I don\u0027t know if they\u0027ll leave it alone for a few days, or weeks, or a few months, but Misao will heal and they\u0027ll come back for us eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means that Damon, Matt, and I - we\u0027re fugitives in two worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I have no idea what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-40.html","bookId":2035,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:14 PM"}
