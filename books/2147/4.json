But the bedroom that Jameson was readying was bare except for a small dresser, making it feel cold and lonely. It didn\u0027t look comforting for a younger sibling to inhabit, and I was wondering how Stormy would feel about staying in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should really do something about this room,\" Alexander said to Jameson. \"Don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it needs a feminine touch,\" Jameson said. Both Romanians looked to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked, excited for a chance to decorate more of the Mansion. \"I\u0027d love to!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ... what does she like?\" I imagined all the things we\u0027d need as I sized up the room. \"We could buy rugs, curtains, and maybe a cool chair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s just visiting, not moving in,\" Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah...\" I said, realizing I was getting ahead of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no - you\u0027re right,\" he added. \"I don\u0027t want her running back to my parents saying she didn\u0027t like it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are her favorite things?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Then my boyfriend thought for a moment. He noticed my Hello Batty earrings. \"She loves Hello Batty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, cool!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have something in common already,\" he said, tenderly patting my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We also have you,\" I said, flashing him a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander returned mine with a radiant grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she like Olivia Outcast, too?\" I wondered out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her favorite color?\" I asked Alexander. \"Black? Pink? Red?\" I didn my\u0027t really know anything about Stormy except that she was Alexander\u0027s sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just because she was a vampire didn\u0027t mean she liked dark things. Maybe she was blonde with little tiny fairy-tale locks. Then I thought of Luna - did she look like her? I couldn\u0027t bear the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... I know she loves purple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! We can put some girlie things in her room, like purple curtains and a funky velvet chair. She would love that! I can picture her already. I\u0027ll put out some candy on the table and a gift bag on her dresser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Alexander said. \"I didn\u0027t even think of that before now, but I\u0027m sure she\u0027d feel much better in something cute and fun rather than this cold, barren room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait to meet her,\" I said enthusiastically. \"I\u0027ve never had a little sister.\" For a moment I dreamed about the perfect sister for me - a younger sibling who would want to have picnics in the cemeteries, stay up late and watch scary-movie marathons, and share dark music together. She\u0027d be nothing like the sibling I had, Billy, a little brother who would rather solve math equations than hang around tombstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve never had a younger brother,\" Alexander said. \"That would be really cool, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we trade?\" I asked seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he said, but I could tell by the glint in his eyes he wasn\u0027t as keen on giving his sibling away as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to find anything fun and funky in Dullsville that would be appropriate or cool for Stormy. I bought most of my clothes and trinkets at thrift stores or online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I shopped at our local discount superstore while Jameson waited for us at the front by the coffee shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my usual stares as we paraded up and down the aisles looking for anything fun to decorate Stormy\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is nice of you, to try so hard to make Alexander\u0027s sister comfortable,\" Becky said as I tossed a purple fleece pillow into our cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I not make the effort? I think it will be cool to have her here, even if it is only for a short while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Becky handed me a neon-green lamp. I shook my head, and she put it back on the shelf. \"I don\u0027t have a little sister. This is foreign territory to me. But whatever we do will be fine. You\u0027re Alexander\u0027s girlfriend. She\u0027ll love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aww, thanks.\" I suddenly felt the pressure relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do to decorate a room for a vampire?\" she asked aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo elderly women glared at us, bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\" I said under my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops,\" Becky said, startled by the ladies overhearing her. \"For Halloween,\" Becky corrected loudly. \"We\u0027re shopping for Halloween.\" We quickly pushed our carts around the gawking ladies and headed for the next aisle, where we burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was close,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know how you do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to my world,\" I remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All this secrecy,\" she whispered. \"It\u0027s very difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it makes it all that much more exciting, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky shrugged her shoulders. She was still getting used to the revelation that the Underworld existed and that it was as close as my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about this?\" I asked, pointing at velvety lavender curtains that were displayed with other sample curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh. Cool. Maybe you can decorate my room next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure!\" I answered, delighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only you\u0027ll have to stay away from blood-reds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky peered out the end of the aisle and into the main part of the store. I followed her. \"Are there any vampires here?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just one wannabe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" she asked with a hush. \"How do you know that everyone here isn\u0027t a vampire?\" We glanced around. A sample of Dullsville\u0027s population permeated the store: couples, families, teens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe glanced around. A sample of Dullsville\u0027s population permeated the store: couples, families, teens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think there has ever been a vampire in this store,\" I answered with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Jameson?\" she asked, looking toward where he was waiting for us near the checkout. \"Is he a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.... He goes out during the day,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s part vampire and part mortal.\" Becky said. \"He sure looks that way.\" Becky\u0027s comment left me feeling curious about Alexander\u0027s butler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve left anything for any other visiting vampires,\" she said, assessing our selections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur carts were full of fun stuff that I thought Stormy might like: pillows, candles, wall hangings, a few scatter rugs and assembly-required furniture to make her space more comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re all set,\" I said, and we headed over to the Creepy Man and his credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander hung up the curtains, and Becky and I placed the scatter rugs on the floor in Stormy\u0027s new room. There was so much dust there, Becky went into a coughing fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boyfriend was attractive even in the dim lighting as he worked as hard as a handsome handyman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this straight?\" he asked. I\u0027d never realized Alexander was such a perfectionist. The drapes hung flawlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the curtains were hung and the funky furniture and shelves were installed, we placed a few ornaments on the antique dresser. Alexander had painted tiny pictures of his family, and I fitted them into frames we\u0027d purchased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll love this,\" Alexander said, examining the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think so?\" I asked. I thought the room was fabulous, but since I hadn\u0027t met Stormy yet, it was hard to know if she would. I could only count on Alexander for his opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what\u0027s not to like?\" Alexander said, sizing up our room makeover. \"This place is awesome!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, too,\" Becky concurred. \"I love how you transformed this room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you both think so,\" I said, wiping my hair away from my face. \"But this is really your grandmother\u0027s home. Stormy might be offended that I decorated it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now it\u0027s my home, too. And besides, my grandmother would be happy to know that you are going to so much trouble for my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a great time doing this,\" I said. \"I\u0027m glad you think your grandmother would approve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, more importantly, Stormy will. She is very opinionated. And this is way cooler than her room at home,\" Alexander added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree, Raven, you\u0027ve outdone yourself,\" Becky said. \"She\u0027s going to love iandng to lt here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Stormy ever visit the Mansion when you were growing up?\" I asked Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as a baby. I don\u0027t think she remembers it. She was so little.\" Alexander beamed as he gazed at our accomplishment and put his arm around my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only problem is now she\u0027ll never want to leave!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-4.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
