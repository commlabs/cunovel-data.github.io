{"id":7650,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9 Letter from Athens","content":"The day that I was about to send M. Hermann Schultz’s story to the publishers, I received from the correspondent to whom I had sent the MS., the following letter:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sir: The history of the King of the Mountains is the invention of an enemy of truth and the gendarmerie. No persons mentioned have set foot in Greece. The police have never vised any passports bearing the name of Mrs. Simons. The Commandant at Piraeus has never heard of The Fancy nor of Mr. John Harris. The Phillips Brothers do not remember of ever having employed Mr. William Lobster. No diplomatic agent has known any Maltese of the name of Giacomo Fondi. The National Bank of Greece has nothing with which to reproach itself, and it has never had on deposit, any funds made by brigandage. If it had received them, it would have considered it a duty to have confiscated them for its profit. I hold, for your inspection, the list of our officers of the gendarmerie. You will find no trace of M. Pericles. I know only two men of that name; one is a tavern-keeper in Athens; the other sells spices in Tripolitza. As for the famous Hadgi-Stavros, whose name I have heard to-day, for the first time, he is a fabulous being whom one must relegate to Mythology. I confess, in all sincerity, that there have been sometimes brigands in the country. The principal ones were destroyed by Hercules or Theseus, who may be considered as the real founders of Greek gendarmerie. Those who escaped the hands of these two heroes, have fallen under the blows of our invincible army. The author of the romance has displayed as much ignorance as dishonesty, in attempting to prove that brigandage exists to-day. I would give a great deal to have this romance published, may be in France, or in England, with the name and portrait of M. Schultz. The world would know by what gross artifices he has attempted to make every civilized nation suspicious of us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for you, Monsieur, who have always given us justice, accept the assurance of the kindest sentiments, with which I have the honor of being,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your very grateful servant,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Patriotis Pseftis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Author of a volume of Dithyrambics upon the regeneration of Greece; editor of the Journal l’Esperance; member of the Archaeological Society of Athens; corresponding member of the Academy of the Ionian Isles; stockholder in the National Company of the Spartan Pavlos.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The Author has the Last Word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Athenian, my fine friend, the truest histories are not those which have happened!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/973/29391.html","bookId":250,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:53:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:53:24 AM"}
