There\u0027s a reason for everything I\u0027ve done. When the dark moon comes, all will be clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As mud,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d come to Edward. Then I\u0027d have to get the others to leave so you\u0027d be alone.\" Lydia spread her hands. \"Werewolves popping up all over the place, and wham, the good doctor is on her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not. I know. I didn\u0027t figure on the FBI showing up and refusing to leave. Some idiot werewolf again - giving the Feds a tip, trying to screw up your life and instead screwing up mine. Heads are going to roll once I\u0027m in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia glanced at the sky, then into the trees. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved me farther into the ravine. As we walked through the sleeping ghost wolves, they awoke and milled around our legs. The sensation was creepy -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;like a chilly brush of wind that scrambled straight through my bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustle from the forest was followed by the murmur of voices, the measured tread of human feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward and Nic pushed their way through the brambles at the edge of the clearing. They gaped at the witchie wolves. Their ability to see them made me uneasy. When they caught sight of Lydia, they pointed their weapons at her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in time to watch the show.\" She put a knife to my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilver, it burned like fire. Smoke rose in an unpleasant stream in front of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will kill her to get to you,\" Edward murmured. \"It is our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic stepped forward and the ground shifted. The witchie wolves howled so loudly my ears rang, then as one they stood and encircled the ravine. Nic\u0027s cell phone rang, the sound shrill and alien in the warm, waiting silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be Will,\" I managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith information that wasn\u0027t crap. Nic punched the on button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay out of the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Will\u0027s voice as clearly as if the phone were pressed to my ear. This increased-power deal was very handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late,\" Nic said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill cursed. \"Definitely stay away from that ravine where most of the bodies are buried. The greatest concentration of spiritual power is there. The witchies will protect that ground, since it was by far the most desecrated. It\u0027s where they\u0027ll come to power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In two weeks?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Fraid not. In some legends the dark moon is when the moon is new. In others, the dark moon shares the sky with the sun. The moon is always there, you just can\u0027t see it in the daytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dark moon is now,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic\u0027s gaze met mine. Understanding filled his eyes, and his grip tightened on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The witchie wolf army can\u0027t be killed,\" Will continued. \"They\u0027re already dead. You need to stop Lydia from... whatever it is she\u0027s going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The most powerful shaman commands them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia\u0027s not an Indian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I muttered, as I remembered Will\u0027s explanation about shamans. \"Blood has nothing to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong.\" Lydia pricked my neck. \"Blood has everything to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground trembled, and Lydia released me. I spun as she lifted the talisman, marked with my blood, toward the sun-drenched sky. \"Blood to the earth, flesh to the flesh, spirits arise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\" I shouted to the others. \"Run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic snorted. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live for this,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two started forward, and the witchie wolves snarled. Both men shot at the nearest wolf. Their bullets went right through the bodies and into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" Nic muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they turned their weapons on Lydia and the wolves charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shouted, but they didn\u0027t seem to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead they knocked the men to the grass. Considering how the bullets had gone through them, the witchies were awfully solid. One wolf sat on each of their chests, while two others yanked their weapons away and dragged them into the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep everyone out.\" Lydia lowered her arms. \"Now it\u0027s just you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witchie wolves howled. \"And them. They want to be led. They don\u0027t know what to do all alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia inched closer. \"I need more blood. I\u0027m thinking, all of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury shot through me. What good were years of ly-canthropy if I couldn\u0027t defeat one crazy witch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith anger came strength, and energy rumbled along my skin like a flaming wind. I couldn\u0027t prevent the growl that tickled my throat from coming out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was shining. I should not feel the call of the moon, but I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t fight it,\" Lydia murmured. \"Shift. In the daylight. You\u0027ll feel a whole lot better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is what she wants,\" Edward shouted. \"Do not do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia\u0027s laughter tickled my spine like a feather. \"Aren\u0027t you tired of him telling you what to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you knew everything there was to know, you\u0027d change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, and she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who your mother was?\" Her voice seemed to come from everywhere. The trees, the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a werewolf,\" I answered. \"Edward killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but do you know why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not why he killed her; why she was a werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of who her father was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother\u0027s father. My grandfather. Who had he been? I\u0027d never asked. No one had ever offered. I was an orphan, my entire family wiped out by werewolves. Maybe that was true. Then again, maybe it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They came after him, but they found her.\" Lydia\u0027s whisper was like a serpent hissing in my ear. \"Death was too easy after all he\u0027d done. Edward arrived too late to save his daughter, but he managed to save you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced in his direction. The witchie wolves had moved back, allowing Edward and Nic to sit up but not to stand. The old man stared across the ravine. One look was all it took to see the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward Mandenauer had killed his own child - my mother - then raised me as a charity case, without love or affection or honesty. I couldn\u0027t believe even he could be so cruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.\" Lydia\u0027s voice tempted me. \"Get mad. Get very, very mad. Shift in the daylight. Imagine the power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know so much?\" I managed, my voice more a beast\u0027s than a woman\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandmother and Edward were... close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maria?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maria was his wife. My grandmother knew him first, loved him best, but then he left her in the lab with Mengele and married Maria, a slut from the city. Granny made sure she discovered all of Edward\u0027s secrets. Which she shared with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury, red, hot, and bubbling, bolted through my blood, giving me strength, lending me focus, a clarity beyond anything I\u0027d ever known. I felt the moon, despite the sun, because the moon was there, but it was dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my mind, I embraced the ebony sheen. I welcomed the darkness, both in the sky and in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands became paws, claws shooting from my fingertips like razor blades. The hearing, the sight, the speed of a wolf was mine. When she spoke again, I was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secrets are always useful. Eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms shot out. A pained gasp whistled through the ravine. I opened my eyes and saw her. My claws around her throat, I\u0027d made kind of a mess. She wasn\u0027t going to die from that wound, but she sure was going to bleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved her mouth, pointed at her throat. I was loath to release her in case she disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute. Why didn\u0027t she disappear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in slow motion, I watched a drop of blood fall through the air, soak into the dirt, as the witchie wolves howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground rippled like water, then spilled outward like the Red Sea. I saw skulls and bones unearthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about desecration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood to the earth, flesh to the flesh, spirits arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat damn incantation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the witchie wolves. They were really wolves now. I could no longer see through them, and according to Will, they were unstoppable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia began to struggle, and her peasant blouse shifted, revealing the talisman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine,\" I growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTangling a paw through the loop, I yanked, then tossed Lydia across the ravine. She hit the ground and lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly everything was quiet. I glanced at the others. Edward winced. I looked at Nic. He pointed toward his eyes, wiggled his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes, my hands, were still wolf, so I took a deep breath, imagined myself human, and I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe talisman\u0027s rope was wrapped around my wrist. I left it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never seen such a thing in all of my life.\" Edward stared at the witchie wolves. They were frozen, uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic crossed the ground in four quick steps and yanked me into his arms. Edward went straight to Lydia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it over?\" Nic asked, his lips against my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly strode into the ravine, along with several other men. I recognized them. The werewolves from the basement disarmed Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anyone not after you?\" Edward snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could answer, Billy grabbed Nic by the back of the neck and tossed him away as easily as I\u0027d tossed Lydia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promised you the flesh of the J��ger-Suchers,\" Billy said. \"Take him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to go after Nic, and Billy backhanded me across the face. \"It\u0027s our time now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could think, concentrate, shift as I\u0027d done with Lydia, Billy hit me again. Then he grabbed me around the waist, yanked me against him and kissed me, sucking the blood from my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy was just not right in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled, but Billy was both a very large, muscular man and an ancient and powerful werewolf. He lifted his head and stared into my face. \"I\u0027ve been waiting so long for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes against the madness in his. I couldn\u0027t feel the moon, couldn\u0027t concentrate past my fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body against mine, his scent filled my nose. His teeth nibbled at my throat as his hands clutched my breasts. There was no way I could focus well enough to marshal the power needed to defeat him, and Billy knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds of a battle rose nearby. Edward was fighting the basement werewolves for his life, and I couldn\u0027t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d kick Lydia\u0027s ass,\" Billy said. \"Then I\u0027d kick yours, and the army would be mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill trickled over my skin. Billy in charge of the witchie wolf army? The world would no longer be fit for anyone or anything. I doubted he\u0027d care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The witchie wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was Nic\u0027s - faint, groggy, but alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly snarled and turned toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I grabbed Billy\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched me, right in the nose, and I flew across the ravine, hitting the ground so hard my teeth rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027d gotten my wish, he came after me instead of Nic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to get up, but my head spun. My nose bled. My teeth felt loose. Billy grabbed me by the shirt and slammed me into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia was right. I\u0027ll just do you when you\u0027re dead.\" He wrapped his huge hands around my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be a lot less trouble that way, and really, I could care less what I fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to speak, but he was squeezing too hard, so I grabbed his fingers and pulled. He laughed. \"You aren\u0027t strong enough. You never were. Hell, you killed me once, and it didn\u0027t stick. You\u0027ll never get another chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" I managed. \"I am stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly smirked and released me. \"Prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to fight him. Nic\u0027s words had made me remember. Only the most powerful shaman commanded the witchie wolf army. But a shaman\u0027s power had nothing to do with physical strength and everything to do with magic, mystery, and belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI captured the icon between my fingers. Either this worked, or we all died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as the witchie wolves howled and understanding rolled over Billy\u0027s face, everything went black. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-34.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
