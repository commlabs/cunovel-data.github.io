The gift was what the sword meant – what it means .’ He sheathed the weapon. ‘The time has come, friend, for our last stand. War we shall now wage.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother rattle from Tulas Shorn’s dry throat, but this time it was laughter. ‘I delight in this irony, beloved blade-brother. Very well, let us go and kill some dragons.’ Then he paused and cocked his head at Silchas. ‘Korabas … will she thank us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you expect her to?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, I suppose not. Why should she? We will fail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now,’ Silchas mused, ‘you give me reason to wonder. After all, will this not be the first time that she does not fall alone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulas was silent for a moment, and then he said, ‘My friend, our deaths shall be our gift to her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tulas, can two Ancients make a Storm?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We shall have to try.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnomander, I believe I shall see you soon. And Andarist, too .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Since we are about to die, Silchas, will you tell me what happened to the Throne of Shadow?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin smiled and shook his head. ‘Perhaps, if the throne so desires, it will one day tell you itself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thrones cannot speak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is true, and it’s just as well, don’t you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is a good thing we are going to die side by side,’ Tulas Shorn growled, ‘else I would be forced to fight you after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had moved well apart, and now they veered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd two Ancient dragons, one living, the other undead, lifted into the empty sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlar Ethil crouched in the grasses like a hare about to be flushed by a hawk. Torrent studied her for a moment longer, struggling to disguise his dark satisfaction, and then turned to check once more on the three children. They slept on – the hag had done something to them. It was just past midday and they’d not travelled far since the dawn. Behind him, the Bonecaster was muttering to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Too many came through – nowhere to hide. I know now what is being attempted. It cannot work. I want it for myself – I will have it for myself! There are Ancients in the sky, but I am the most ancient one of all. I will see them driven back … but first, Korabas needs to die. They need to fail!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent walked over to his horse. Examined the primitive-looking arrows in the quiver strapped beside the bow. Then he glanced back at Olar Ethil. ‘What are we waiting for?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer battered face lifted. ‘I will not be part of this fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked round, seeing nothing but empty plains. ‘What fight?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are as good as dead already, pup. Soon I won’t need you any more. I have gifts to give. And he will forgive me – you’ll see, he’ll forgive me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How can I see anything if I’m to be dead soon?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened, kicked at the grasses. Two skeletal lizards dodged out, evading her gnarled foot. He heard their clacking jaws as they scampered past him, down the slope and away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s it then,’ Olar Ethil rasped, watching them flee. ‘They’re gone. Good. I never trusted them – GO!’ She hobbled to the edge of the ridge, shouted after them, ‘Find the great Storm of T’iam! As if that will help you, hah!’ Then she wheeled and stabbed a crooked finger at Torrent. ‘I am watching you, pup!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent sighed. ‘It’s all going wrong, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Errastas was a fool! And all the Elders who listened to him – his madness will kill them all! Good! So long as he leaves me alone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’ve lost your mind, hag.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wake them up!’ Olar Ethil snapped. ‘We need to go south – and we must hurry!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I smell the sea on this wind,’ Torrent said, facing east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course you do, you fool. Now get the runts up – we must go!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are losing your grip, witch, and you know it, don’t you? You think that whatever you set out to do will be enough, that it will solve everything – but now you’re discovering that it won’t. I hope I do live for a while longer – long enough to be standing over your corpse .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your mind leaks, pup.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only leaks what I let through .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot him a look. Torrent turned away, went to awaken the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelorast lunged and leapt alongside Curdle. ‘We’ll be safe there, Curdle, won’t we? The chains of our curse – broken in the Storm! Right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What I planned from the very start, Telorast – and if you weren’t so thick you’d have guessed that long ago.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-345.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
