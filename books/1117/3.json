but her eyes were turned to the ground, and he could hardly see them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Miss Susan,” he continued, “I may as well speak out now as at another time.” \u0026nbsp;He too was looking towards the ground, and clearly did not know what to do with his hands. \u0026nbsp;“The truth is just this. \u0026nbsp;I—I love you dearly, with all my heart. \u0026nbsp;I never saw any one I ever thought so beautiful, so nice, and so good;—and what’s more, I never shall. \u0026nbsp;I’m not very good at this sort of thing, I know; but I couldn’t go away from Saratoga for six weeks and not tell you.” \u0026nbsp;And then he ceased. \u0026nbsp;He did not ask for any love in return. \u0026nbsp;His presumption had not got so far as that yet. \u0026nbsp;He merely declared his passion, leaning against the door, and there he stood twiddling his thumbs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Susan had not the slightest conception of the way in which she ought to receive such a declaration. \u0026nbsp;She had never had a lover before; nor had she ever thought of Aaron absolutely as a lover, though something very like love for him had been crossing over her spirit. \u0026nbsp;Now, at this moment, she felt that he was the beau-idéal of manhood, though his boots were covered with the railway mud, and though his pantaloons were tucked up in rolls round his ankles. \u0026nbsp;He was a fine, well-grown, open-faced fellow, whose eye was bold and yet tender, whose brow was full and broad, and all his bearing manly. \u0026nbsp;Love him! \u0026nbsp;Of course she loved him. \u0026nbsp;Why else had her heart melted with pleasure when her mother said that that second picture was to be accepted?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But what was she to say? \u0026nbsp;Anything but the open truth; she well knew that. \u0026nbsp;The open truth would not do at all. \u0026nbsp;What would her mother say and Hetta if she were rashly to say that? \u0026nbsp;Hetta, she knew, would be dead against such a lover, and of her mother’s approbation she had hardly more hope. \u0026nbsp;Why they should disapprove of Aaron as a lover she had never asked herself. \u0026nbsp;There are many nice things that seem to be wrong only because they are so nice. \u0026nbsp;Maybe that Susan regarded a lover as one of them. \u0026nbsp;“Oh, Mr. Dunn, you shouldn’t.” \u0026nbsp;That in fact was all that she could say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Should not I?” said he. \u0026nbsp;“Well, perhaps not;

she could only love. \u0026nbsp;She could use her mind only in recounting to herself the perfections of that demigod whose heavy steps were so audible overhead, as he walked to and fro collecting his things and putting them into his bag.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then, just when he had finished, she bethought herself that he must be hungry. \u0026nbsp;She flew to the kitchen, but she was too late. \u0026nbsp;Before she could even reach at the loaf of bread he descended the stairs, with a clattering noise, and heard her voice as she spoke quickly to Kate O’Brien.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Miss Susan,” he said, “don’t get anything for me, for I’m off.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, Mr. Dunn, I am so sorry. \u0026nbsp;You’ll be so hungry on your journey,” and she came out to him in the passage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall want nothing on the journey, dearest, if you’ll say one kind word to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again her eyes went to the ground. \u0026nbsp;“What do you want me to say, Mr. Dunn?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say, God bless you, Aaron.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “God bless you, Aaron,” said she;

as yet Mr. Beckard had not spoken out, but there was reason to suppose that he would do so before those six weeks would be over, and then she would be able to seek counsel from him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Beckard spoke out at the end of six days, and Hetta frankly accepted him. \u0026nbsp;“I hope you’ll love your brother-in-law,” said she to Susan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I will indeed,” said Susan;

then he was to go elsewhere, and not to return to Saratoga till June. \u0026nbsp;“But he hoped,” so said the letter, “that Mrs. Bell would not turn him into the street even then, though the summer might have come, and her regular lodgers might be expected.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh dear, oh dear!” said Mrs. Bell to herself, reflecting that she had no one of whom she could ask advice, and that she must decide that very day. \u0026nbsp;Why had she let Mr. Beckard go without telling him? \u0026nbsp;Then she told Susan, and Susan spent the day trembling. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps, thought Mrs. Bell, he will say nothing about it. \u0026nbsp;In such case, however, would it not be her duty to say something? \u0026nbsp;Poor mother! \u0026nbsp;She trembled nearly as much as Susan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was dark when the fatal knock came at the door. \u0026nbsp;The tea-things were already laid, and the tea-cake was already baked; for it would at any rate be necessary to give Mr. Dunn his tea. \u0026nbsp;Susan, when she heard the knock, rushed from her chair and took refuge up stairs. \u0026nbsp;The widow gave a long sigh and settled her dress. \u0026nbsp;Kate O’Brien with willing step opened the door, and bade her old friend welcome.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How are the ladies?” asked Aaron, trying to gather something from the face and voice of the domestic.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Miss Hetta and Mr. Beckard be gone off to Utica, just man-and-wife like! and so they are, more power to them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh indeed;

but at the moment she had nothing to say but, “Oh dear, oh dear!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “May I not call you mother?” said he, taking both her hands in his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh dear—oh dear! \u0026nbsp;But will you be good to her? \u0026nbsp;Oh, Aaron Dunn, if you deceive my child!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In another quarter of an hour, Susan was kneeling at her mother’s knee, with her face on her mother’s lap;

four or five days during which Susan might be happy, Aaron triumphant, and Mrs. Bell nervous. \u0026nbsp;Days I have said, but after all it was only the evenings that were so left. \u0026nbsp;Every morning Susan got up to give Aaron his breakfast, but Mrs. Bell got up also. \u0026nbsp;Susan boldly declared her right to do so, and Mrs. Bell found no objection which she could urge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But after that Aaron was always absent till seven or eight in the evening, when he would return to his tea. \u0026nbsp;Then came the hour or two of lovers’ intercourse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But they were very tame, those hours. \u0026nbsp;The widow still felt an undefined fear that she was wrong, and though her heart yearned to know that her daughter was happy in the sweet happiness of accepted love, yet she dreaded to be too confident. \u0026nbsp;Not a word had been said about money matters; not a word of Aaron Dunn’s relatives. \u0026nbsp;So she did not leave them by themselves, but waited with what patience she could for the return of her wise counsellors.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then Susan hardly knew how to behave herself with her accepted suitor. \u0026nbsp;She felt that she was very happy; but perhaps she was most happy when she was thinking about him through the long day, assisting in fixing little things for his comfort, and waiting for his evening return. \u0026nbsp;And as he sat there in the parlour, she could be happy then too, if she were but allowed to sit still and look at him,—not stare at him, but raise her eyes every now and again to his face for the shortest possible glance, as she had been used to do ever since he came there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But he, unconscionable lover, wanted to hear her speak, was desirous of being talked to, and perhaps thought that he should by rights be allowed to sit by her, and hold her hand. \u0026nbsp;No such privileges were accorded to him. \u0026nbsp;If they had been alone together, walking side by side on the green turf, as lovers should walk, she would soon have found the use of her tongue,—have talked fast enough no doubt. \u0026nbsp;Under such circumstances, when a girl’s shyness has given way to real intimacy, there is in general no end to her power of chatting. \u0026nbsp;But though there was much love between Aaron and Susan, there was as yet but little intimacy. \u0026nbsp;And then, let a mother be ever so motherly—and no mother could have more of a mother’s tenderness than Mrs. Bell—still her presence must be a restraint. \u0026nbsp;Aaron was very fond of Mrs. Bell; but nevertheless he did sometimes wish that some domestic duty would take her out of the parlour for a few happy minutes. \u0026nbsp;Susan went out very often, but Mrs. Bell seemed to be a fixture.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2901/80022.html","bookId":1117,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:04:17 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:04:17 PM"}
