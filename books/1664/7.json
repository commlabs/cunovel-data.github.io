And I know I’ve lied to you about almost everything, but you wouldn’t believe the truth without seeing it. And once you do, things will be different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing in this world that they could show me that would change my mind, but I also recognized the futility of fighting him on this. “I need to get dry clothes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. “You’re not staying in here while I get dressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared in annoyance. “Get changed in the bathroom. Close the door. Your virtue is safe from me.” And then he winked. “Unless you want that to change, and I’m so down for that. It does get boring around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy palm itched to wrap around a very unladylike place and twist. The words that came out of my mouth were my own. I felt them. I believed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to kill you one day,” I promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wry smile appeared on his face as he met my stare. “You’ve killed, Katy. You know how it feels to take a life, but you aren’t a murderer. You aren’t a killer.” He caught my sharp inhale with a knowing look. “Not yet, at least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away, curling my hands into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, we aren’t the bad guys. The Luxen are, and you will see that I’m not lying. We are here to stop them from taking over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Blake and I stepped out of my cell, two military guys surrounded us. One of them was Archer. Seeing his familiar face didn’t bring the warm fuzzies. He and the other guy were heavily armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ushered Blake and me toward the elevator, and I craned my neck, trying to see around them to get a grasp on my surroundings. There were several doors like mine, and it looked just like the corridor at Mount Weather. A heavy hand landed on the small of my back, startling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent me a look I couldn’t decipher, and then I was in the elevator, squeezed between him and Blake. I couldn’t even lift my hand to brush away the damp, cold hair that clung to the back of my neck without knocking into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher leaned forward, pushing a button I couldn’t see because of his mammoth body. I frowned, realizing I didn’t even know how many floors this place had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he were reading my mind, Blake looked down at me. “We’re underground right now. Most of the base is, with the exception of the two upper levels. You’re on the seventh floor. Floor seven and six are housing for…well, visitors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered why he was even telling me this. The layout had to be important information. It was like…like he trusted me with the knowledge, like I was already one of them. I shook the ridiculous notion out of my head. “You mean the prisoners?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher stiffened beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake ignored that. “The fifth floor houses Luxen who are being assimilated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the last of the Luxen arrived when Daemon and his family did, more than eighteen years ago, I couldn’t imagine how they were still assimilating any of them. My educated guess was that these were Luxen who they believed didn’t “fit” with the humans for one reason or another. I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd underground? I hated the idea of being underground. It was too much like being dead and buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiggled my way out from between them, stepping back as I dragged in a deep breath. Blake eyed me curiously, but it was Archer who planted a hand on my shoulder, guiding me forward so I wasn’t behind them, like I was going to ninja-stab them in their backs with my invisible knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator came to a stop, and the doors slid open. Immediately I caught the scent of food—fresh bread and cooked meat. My stomach roared to life, grumbling like a troll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher’s brow went up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flamed. Good to know my sense of pride and embarrassment was still intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When was the last time you ate?” Archer asked. It was the first time he’d spoken since I’d been with him and Dr. Roth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. “I…I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, and I looked away as we stepped out into the wide, brightly lit hallway. I honestly had no idea what day it was or how many days I had been out of it. Up until when I smelled food, I hadn’t even been hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re meeting with Dr. Roth,” Blake said, starting toward the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand on my shoulder tightened, and even though I wanted to shove it off, I became very still. Archer looked like he knew how to break a neck in six seconds flat. Blake’s gaze went from Archer’s hand to the man’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to get something to eat first,” Archer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake protested. “The doctor is waiting. So is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They can wait a couple more minutes so the girl can eat something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” Blake lifted his hand in a way that said, It’s your problem, not mine. “I’ll let him know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher steered me toward the right. Only then did I realize the other military guy had gone with Blake. For a second, everything spun as we started forward. He walked liked Daemon, taking long, quick strides. I struggled to keep up while trying to absorb every detail of where I was. Which wasn’t much. Everything was white and lit by bright track lighting. Identical doors lined both sides of the endless hallway. The low hum of conversation behind closed doors was barely discernible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of food grew stronger, and then we came upon double glass doors. He opened them with his free hand. I felt like I was being escorted into the principal’s office instead of into the rather normal-looking cafeteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClean square tables were spaced in three rows. Most of the ones up front were occupied. Archer led me to the first vacant table and pushed me down into a seat. Not a big fan of being manhandled, I shot him a glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay here,” he said, then spun on his heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere in the hell did he think I would go? I watched him walk toward the front where a short line of people was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could still make a run for it and take the risk of not knowing where to go, but my stomach tumbled at the prospect. I knew how many floors were above. I scanned the room, and my heart sank. Little black dots of doom were everywhere, and the cameras weren’t so hidden. Someone was probably watching me right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen and women in lab coats and fatigues milled around, none of them giving me more than a cursory glance as they passed by. I sat uncomfortably straight, wondering how commonplace it was for them to see a kidnapped teenager scared out of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably more than I cared to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are here to stop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake’s words came back to me, and I sucked in a breath. Stop who? How could the Luxen be the bad guys? My mind raced, caught between wanting to figure out what he meant and not trusting anything he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher returned with a plate of eggs and bacon in one hand and a little carton of milk in the other. He sat them down in front of me wordlessly, then produced a plastic fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the plate as he sat across from me. A lump formed in my throat as I reached out slowly, my hand hovering over the fork. I suddenly thought of what Blake had said about his stay here—about how everything had been covered in onyx. Had that been true? The fork was obviously harmless, and I had no idea what to believe anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” Archer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers wrapped around the plastic fork, and when nothing hurt, I breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched me, his expression telling me he had no idea what I was thanking him for, and I kind of wondered, too. I was surprised by his kindness. Or at least I saw this as kindness. He could’ve been like Blake and the other guy and not given a damn about my starving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ate my food quickly. The whole thing was awkward on a painful level. He didn’t speak, and he didn’t take his eyes off me once, like he was on alert for shenanigans. I wasn’t sure what he expected me to do with a plastic plate and fork. Once, his gaze seemed drawn to my left cheek, and I wasn’t sure what he was staring at. I hadn’t looked in the mirror when I got ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food tasted like sawdust in my mouth, and my jaw ached from the chewing, but I cleared the plate, figuring I needed the energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finished, the plate and utensil were left behind on the table. Archer’s hand was on my shoulder again. Our trip back was silent and the hall a bit more crowded. We stopped outside a closed room. Without knocking, he opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother medical room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite walls. Cabinets. Trays with medical instruments. A table with…stirrups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backpedaled, shaking my head. My heart pounded crazy fast as my gaze bounced from Dr. Roth to Blake, who was sitting in a plastic chair. The other guy who’d gone with Blake earlier was nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher’s hand tightened, and before I could get completely out the door, he stopped me. “Don’t,” he said softly, loud enough for only me to hear. “No one wants a repeat of yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head jerked toward him, and my eyes locked with his blue ones. “I don’t want to do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t blink. “You don’t have a choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rushed my eyes as his words sunk in. I glanced at the doctor, then at Blake. The latter looked away, a muscle popping in his jaw. The hopelessness of it all hit me. Up until that moment, I don’t know what I was really thinking. That I still had some say in what was going to happen around me and to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Roth cleared his throat. “How are you feeling today, Katy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to laugh, but my voice came out a croak. “What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’ll get easier.” He stepped to the side, motioning me toward the table. “Especially once we get this done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressure clamped down on my chest, and my hands opened and closed at my sides. I’d never had a panic attack before, but I was pretty sure I was seconds away from one. “I don’t want them in the room.” The words came out quick and raspy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake glanced around and then stood, rolling his eyes. “I’ll wait outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to kick him as he strolled by, but Archer was still there. I turned to him, my eyes feeling like they were bulging out of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said, moving to stand in front of the door. He clasped his hands. “I’m not leaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to cry. There would be no fighting back. The room, like the hallway and cafeteria, had shiny walls. No doubt it was the mixture of onyx and diamond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor handed me one of those god-awful hospital gowns, then pointed toward a curtain. “You can get changed behind there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a numb haze, I headed behind the curtain. My fingers fumbled over my clothing and then the gown. Stepping out from behind the curtain, my body was hot and cold, legs weak as I walked forward. Everything was too bright, and my arms shook as I hoisted myself onto the padded table. I clutched the little ties on the gown, unable to look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to take some blood first,” the doctor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything that happened next I was either hyperaware of or completely detached from. The sharpness of the needle as it slid into my vein, I felt all the way to my toes, then the slight tug of a tube being replaced atop the needle. The doctor was talking to me, but I didn’t really hear him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/origin-lux-4/page-7.html","bookId":1664,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:47 PM"}
