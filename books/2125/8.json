{"id":93883,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Rob said curtly. \"Don\u0027t keep us all waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horn blared again behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna rose without any of her usual grace. Her movements were jerky, full of repressed energy. She snatched up her duffel bag and began to fumble with the door handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait sat stiffly, her shoulders tense, her head high. Her heart was pounding with defensive fury. Let Anna go if she wanted. It just showed she\u0027d never cared for the rest of them in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought came out of nowhere, like a tiny glint of light in her mind, there and gone in an instant. It was enough to shock Kaitlyn into some kind of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculous - of course Anna cared for the rest of them. Anna cared about everything, from the earth itself to the animals she loved to just about any person that crossed her path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then why was Kait so angry with her? Kait could feel all the physical symptoms. The pounding heart, the shortness of breath - the flushed face and tight feeling at her temples. More, there was a wild need to move in her muscles, like the desire to hit something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhysical symptoms. It was another glint, surfacing from Kaitlyn\u0027s subconscious. And suddenly she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anna, wait. Wait,\" she said just as Anna wrestled the door open. She tried to make her voice calm, when it kept wanting to come out panicked or seething.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna stopped but didn\u0027t turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see - everybody, don\u0027t you see?\" Kaitlyn looked around at the others. \"This isn\u0027t real. We\u0027re all upset, but we\u0027re not really upset at each other. We\u0027re just feeling angry, so our minds think there must be a reason to be angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just nerves, I suppose,\" Gabriel sneered. His lip was curled and his gray eyes were savage. \"We couldn\u0027t possibly really hate each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I don\u0027t know what it is, but - \" Kaitlyn broke off, realizing that in addition to all the other physical symptoms she was shivering. It was cold in the van, colder than could be explained by the open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was a strange odor in her nostrils, a sewer stench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you smell that? It\u0027s the same thing I smelled yesterday when Lewis did his sleepwalking bit. And it\u0027s cold like yesterday, too.\" Kaitlyn could see confusion mingling with the anger in the faces around her, and she turned to the one person she trusted absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob, she said fervently, please listen. I know it\u0027s hard because you feel like you\u0027re angry, but just try. Something\u0027s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Rob\u0027s face cleared. The smoldering fury went out of his amber-colored eyes, leaving them golden and somewhat bewildered. He blinked and put a hand to his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he said. \"It\u0027s like that psychology experiment - give someone an injection of adrenaline, and then put them in a room with someone acting angry. The first person gets angry, too, but it\u0027s not real anger. It\u0027s been induced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s doing that to us,\" Kaitlyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how?\" Lewis demanded. He sounded scoffing, but not as exasperated as before. \"Nobody\u0027s given us any injections.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long distance,\" Rob said. \"It\u0027s a psychic attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was flat and positive. His eyes had gone dark gold. Outside, the blaring horn had given way to several horns sounding continuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the door, Anna,\" Rob said quietly. \"I\u0027ll find a place to pull over. There\u0027s something I ought to have told you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna slid the door shut. A few minutes later they had pulled over by the roadside and Rob was looking at the rest of them soberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have mentioned it this morning,\" he said. \"But I wasn\u0027t sure, and I didn\u0027t see any point in you all worrying. Those slug tracks... well, back at Durham I heard stories about people waking up to find those around their house. Slime trails or sometimes footprints of people or animals. They almost always went along with nightmares - people having terrible dreams the night before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNightmares. Now Kaitlyn remembered. \"I had a terrible dream last night,\" she said. \"There were all these people leaning over me. Gray people - they looked like pencil sketches. And it was cold - just the way it was a few minutes ago.\" She looked at Rob. \"But what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said all those things were signs of a psychic attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A psychic attack,\" Gabriel repeated, but his tone was less sarcastic than it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stories were that dark psychics could do things even over long distances. They could visualize you and use PK, telepathy, even astral projection.\" His troubled eyes turned back to Kait. \"Those gray people you saw - I\u0027ve heard that astral projections are colorless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Astral projections as in letting your mind do the walking? Leaving your body behind?\" Lewis asked, cocking an eyebrow. The atmosphere had changed; the web was no longer quivering with animosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait thought that everyone looked like themselves again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob was nodding. \"That\u0027s it. And I\u0027ve heard that psychic attacks can make you weak or nervous - even make you think you\u0027re going crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I was going crazy just now,\" Anna said. Her eyes were large and bright with unshed tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, everybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, too,\" Kaitlyn said. She and Anna looked at each other a moment and then simultaneously reached forward to hug each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, everybody\u0027s sorry,\" Gabriel said impatiently. \"But we\u0027ve got more important things to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA psychic attack means one thing - we\u0027ve been found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Zetes,\" Rob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else? But the question is, who\u0027s he gotten to do it? What psychics are attacking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn tried to visualize the faces in her dream. It was impossible. The features had been too blurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Z had a lot of contacts,\" Rob said wearily. \"Obviously he\u0027s found some new friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna was shaking her head. \"But how can he have found such powerful ones so fast? I mean, we couldn\u0027t do what they\u0027re doing, and we\u0027re supposed to be the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best of our age group,\" Rob began, but Kaitlyn said, \"The crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding flared immediately in Gabriel\u0027s eyes. \"That\u0027s it. The crystal is amplifying their power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s dangerous,\" Kaitlyn started, and then she shut up at an ominous glance from Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntent on his own thoughts, Rob didn\u0027t seem to notice. \"Obviously, they don\u0027t care about the danger, and while they\u0027re using the crystal they\u0027re much stronger than we are. The point is that we\u0027ve got to be prepared. They\u0027re not finished with us - and the attacks will probably get worse. We\u0027ve got to be ready for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but ready how?\" asked Lewis. \"What can you do against that kind of attack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob shrugged. \"At the Durham Center I heard people talk about envisioning light - protective light. The problem is that I never really listened. I don\u0027t know how you do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn let out her breath and sat back. The others were doing the same, and a sense of apprehension ran through the web. Apprehension - and vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I suppose we\u0027d better get back on the road,\" Kait said finally. \"It\u0027s no good sitting around and thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just everybody be on the lookout for anything unusual,\" Rob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing unusual happened on the rest of the drive. Anna took the wheel and they resumed their beach-scanning, agreeing that nothing on the Oregon coast looked like the place in their dreams. The rock was too black - volcanic, apparently - and the water too open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s still not north enough,\" Kait said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped that night at a little town called Cannon Beach, just below the Washington border. It was already dark by the time Anna pulled the van into a quiet street that dead-ended on the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This may not be legal, but I don\u0027t think anybody\u0027s going to bother us,\" she said. \"For that matter, I\u0027ve hardly seen anybody around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a resort town,\" Rob said. \"And this is off season.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt certainly seemed like off season to Kaitlyn. The sky was clouding over, and it was cold and windy outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw a little store back there on the main street,\" she said. \"We\u0027ve got to buy something for dinner - we ate the last of the bread and peanut butter for lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go,\" Anna said. \"I don\u0027t mind the cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob nodded. \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only once they were gone that Kait wished Lewis had gone, too. She was getting worried about Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed tense and distant, staring out the window into the dark. In the web Kaitlyn could feel only coldness and a sense of walls - as if he were living in a castle of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the highest walls up when he had the most to hide, Kaitlyn knew. Right now she was worried that he was suffering - and that he wouldn\u0027t come to her for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027d noticed something else. He was still sitting in the front passenger seat. The rest of them had changed places every so often, but Gabriel always stuck to the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder, Kait thought, if it could have anything to do with the fact that I always stick to the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was getting fairly good at screening her thoughts when she concentrated. Neither Lewis nor Gabriel seemed to have heard that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob and Anna returned windblown and laughing, clutching paper bags to their chests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We splurged,\" Rob said. \"Microwave hot dogs - they\u0027re still pretty hot - and Nachos and potato chips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Oreos,\" Anna said, puffing back wisps of black hair that had blown in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis grinned as he unwrapped a hot dog. \"Pure junk food. Joyce would die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn glanced at him, and for a moment everyone stilled. We still can\u0027t really believe it, Kait thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all know Joyce betrayed us, but we can\u0027t accept it. How could anyone put on an act the way she did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was so -\u0026nbsp; alive,\" Anna said. \"Effervescent. Energetic. I liked her from the minute I saw her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she used that,\" Gabriel snarled. \"She was recruiting us; making us like her was just a technique.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo tense, Kaitlyn thought. He\u0027s incredibly on edge. She watched Gabriel tearing into a hot dog almost savagely, and worry shifted in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really hits the spot, doesn\u0027t it?\" she said. Her eyes were on Gabriel, and she tried to keep her presence in the web completely neutral. She added casually, \"But maybe it\u0027s not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got two for everybody and a couple of extras,\" Anna said, following Kait\u0027s gaze to Gabriel. \"You can have one of the extras, Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved her off impatiently. His gray eyes, fixed on Kaitlyn, were full of angry warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just trying to be helpful,\" Kaitlyn said. She leaned close to Gabriel to fish a potato chip out of the bag and added in a low voice, \"I wish you\u0027d let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can help by leaving me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought was swift and brutal - and meant only for her. Kaitlyn could tell that none of the others had heard it. Trust Gabriel to have perfected the art of private communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he wasn\u0027t going to come to her. He needed to, she was sure of that now. His face seemed even paler than usual, almost chalky, and there was a repressed violence to his movements. As if he were under some terrible internal pressure, and in danger of flying apart at any minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was stubborn, and that meant he wouldn\u0027t come. Gabriel didn\u0027t know how to ask for help, he only knew how to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever mind, Kaitlyn thought, watching him surreptitiously. I\u0027m stubborn, too. And I\u0027m damned if I\u0027m going to let you kill yourself - or anybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel waited until they were all asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn had been the last to succumb, fighting even the warmth they\u0027d produced by running the van\u0027s heaters before they bedded down. He\u0027d felt the red-gold shimmer of her thoughts running on when all the others were still and silent. She was trying to outwait him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t work. Gabriel could be patient when he had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen even Kaitlyn\u0027s thoughts had faded into a humming blank, Gabriel quietly sat up in the driver\u0027s seat and opened the door beside him. He slid out and had the door shut again almost before anyone could stir. Then he waited a moment, his senses focused on the inside of the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill asleep. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind out here was bitterly cold. Not the sort of night for any sensible person to be out wandering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a problem, and Gabriel thought about it as he trudged through the dry, loose sand above the high tide line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looked up. There were cottages and duplexes on the beach, as well as motel units. And some of them must be occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to dredge up a killing smile, but he couldn\u0027t quite manage. Breaking and entering was one crime he\u0027d never committed before. Somehow it seemed different from picking a victim at random off the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the other choice was Kaitlyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the killing smile came easily. It was a smile for himself, and full of self-mockery. Because Kaitlyn was the obvious choice - the girl was warm and willing and definitely pleasant to link up with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer life energy encased her in a scintillating ruby glow; her mind was a place of blue pools and blazing meteors. He\u0027d been tempted all day by the aura that surrounded her like a charged field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been all he could do not to plunge into that halo and drink it in gulps. Find a transfer point and fix on to it like a leech. He\u0027d needed her desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a complete fool would have turned down her help when it was freely offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting his way through crumbling sand while the wind lashed around him like a lost spirit, Gabriel smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he began to trudge toward one of the cottages that had a light in the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait woke up and cursed herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been absolutely determined not to fall asleep. And now Gabriel was gone, of course. She could feel his absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she have been so stupid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had practice, now, in disentangling herself from Rob and slipping away soundlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait almost yelped as she stepped away from the van and into the wind. She should have brought a jacket - but it was no use thinking about that now. Head bent, arms wrapped around herself, she cast her thoughts wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had practice now in searching for Gabriel, too. He was good at concealing himself, but she knew what to look for. In only a moment she had found it - a faraway sense of glittering ice. Like a blue-white spark on the edge of her mind. Kait turned her body toward it and started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was rough going. The wind blew sheets of sand away from her. When the moon came out, it showed particles whisking through the air like ghosts. It also showed a gigantic rock shaped like a haystack rearing out of the ocean, where no rock had any business being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spooky place. Kaitlyn tried not to think about psychic attacks and Mr. Zetes. She was crazy to have come out here alone, of course - but what else could she do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind smelled of saltwater. From her left came the soft-but-loud crashing of waves. Kait swerved to avoid driftwood and then turned sharply, heading for a cluster of cottages. There. Gabriel was very close; she could feel it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next moment she saw him; a dark silhouette against a lighted window. Alarm spurted through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat window - she knew what he was doing loitering around a cottage. What if he\u0027d already...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was involuntary, wrung out of her by panic. Kaitlyn\u0027s heart thumped before she realized that Rob and the others were out of range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel wasn\u0027t. His head whipped around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing? she countered. What have you done, Gabriel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw him hesitate, then saw him abandon the cottage window abruptly and come striding toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked to meet him, and he pulled her into the shelter of a carport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t I take a walk without being followed?\" he said venomously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn gave herself a moment before answering. She was trying to smooth her hair, which the wind had turned into a mane of elf-locks and fine tangles. And she needed to catch her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she looked at him. A streetlight outside illuminated half his face, leaving the other half in shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn could see enough. His skin looked tight, as if it had been stretched over his bones. There were black circles under his eyes. And there was something about his expression... the way he stared at her, eyes narrowed, lips drawn back a little as he breathed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel was on the breaking point. And, no, he hadn\u0027t gotten into that cottage yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you were doing?\" she said. \"Taking a walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" His lips drew back a little farther. His eyes had turned defiant - he was going to brazen this out. \"I need to get away from the rest of you once in a while. There\u0027s only so much of Kessler\u0027s mind I can stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you just wanted some privacy.\" She took a step toward him. \"And you decided now was the time for a little stroll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith startling suddenness he flashed his most dazzling smile. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait took another step. The smile disappeared as suddenly as it had come, leaving his mouth grim. \"In the middle of the night. In the freezing cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked dangerous now. Dark and dangerous as a wolf on the hunt. \"That\u0027s right, Kait. Now be a good girl and go back to the van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn moved again, close enough that she could feel his warmth - and he could feel hers. She could feel the instant tension in his body, could see his eyes darken. She could hear his breath become uneven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been a good girl. Ask anybody back home - they said I have an attitude problem. So you were just hanging around that cottage by accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the sudden change in subject without blinking, but when he spoke it was through clenched teeth. \"What else would I be doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought\" - Kaitlyn tilted her head back to look up at him - \"that you might need something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need anything from anyone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d accomplished something astonishing just then - she\u0027d made Gabriel give way before her. He\u0027d retreated, stepping back until the concrete wall behind him stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait didn\u0027t give him a chance to regroup. She knew the risk of what she was doing. Gabriel was on the verge of snapping - and he was capable of violence. But she wouldn\u0027t let herself think about the danger; she could only think about the shining torment in Gabriel\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to him again, this time so close that they were touching. Carefully, deliberately, she put her hands on his chest. She could feel the running-stag clamor of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked up at him, her face inches from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re lying,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-possessed-dark-visions-2/page-8.html","bookId":2125,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:06 PM"}
