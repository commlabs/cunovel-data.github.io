{"id":110169,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eShay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe siren faded behind her. It seemed like forever - or only seconds - that Tally fell, the gaping faces below becoming larger and larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground hurtled toward her, a space opening in the panicking crowd where she was going to hit. For a few moments it was just like a flying dream, silent and wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen reality jerked at her shoulders and thighs, the webbing of the jacket cutting viciously into her. She was taller than pretty standard, she knew; the jacket probably wasn\u0027t expecting this much weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally somersaulted in the air, turning headfirst for a few terrifying moments, her face passing low enough to spot a discarded bottle cap in the grass. Then she found herself shooting upward again, completing the circle, so that the sky wheeled above her, then over and downward again, more crowd parting in front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect. She had pushed off hard enough that she was bouncing down the hill away from Garbo Mansion, the jacket carrying her toward the darkness and safety of the gardens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally spun head over heels twice more, and then the jacket lowered her to the grass. She pulled randomly at straps until the garment made a hissing sound and dropped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dizziness took a moment to clear as she tried to sort up from down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t she...ugly?\" someone asked from the edge of the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black shapes of two firefighting hovercars zoomed past overhead, red lights flashing and sirens piercing her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great idea, Peris,\" she muttered. \"A false alarm.\" She would really be in trouble if they caught her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never evenheard of anyone doing anything this bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally ran toward the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness below the willows was comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown here, halfway to the river, Tally could barely tell there was a full-scale fire alert in the middle of town. But she could see that a search was underway. More hovercars were in the air than usual, and the river seemed to be lit up extra bright. Maybe that was just a coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut probably not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally made her way carefully through the trees. It was later than she and Peris had ever stayed over in New Pretty Town. The pleasure gardens were more crowded, especially the dark parts. And now that the excitement of her escape had worn off, Tally was beginning to realize how stupid the whole idea had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course Peris didn\u0027t have the scar anymore. The two of them had only used a penknife when they\u0027d cut themselves and held hands. The doctors used much sharper and bigger knives in the operation. They rubbed you raw, and you grew all new skin, perfect and clear. The old marks of accidents and bad food and childhood illnesses all washed away. A clean start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tally had ruined Peris\u0027s starting over - showing up like some pesky littlie who\u0027s not wanted, and leaving him with the bad taste of ugly in his mouth, not to mention covered with mud. She hoped he had another vest to change into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Peris hadn\u0027t seemed too angry. He\u0027d said they\u0027d be best friends again, once she was pretty. But the way he\u0027d looked at her face...maybe that was why they separated uglies from pretties. It must be horrible to see an ugly face when you\u0027re surrounded by such beautiful people all the time. What if she\u0027d ruined everything tonight, and Peris would always see her like this - squinty eyes and frizzy hair - even after she had the operation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hovercar passed overhead, and Tally ducked. She was probably going to get caught tonight, and never be turned pretty at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe deserved it for being so stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally reminded herself of her promise to Peris. She wasnot going to get caught; she had to become pretty for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light flashed in the corner of her vision. Tally crouched and peered through the hanging willow leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA safety warden was in the park. She was a middle pretty, not a new one. In the firelight, the handsome features of the second operation were obvious: broad shoulders and a firm jaw, a sharp nose and high cheekbones. The woman carried the same unquestionable authority as Tally\u0027s teachers back in Uglyville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally swallowed. New pretties had their own wardens. There was only one reason why a middle pretty would be here in New Pretty Town: The wardens were looking for someone, and they were serious about finding him or her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman flashed her light at a couple on a bench, illuminating them for the split second it took to confirm that they were pretty. The couple jumped, but the warden chuckled and apologized. Tally could hear her low, sure voice, and saw the new pretties relax. Everything had to be okay if she said it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally felt herself wanting to give up, to throw herself on the wise mercy of the warden. If she just explained, the warden would understand and fix everything. Middle pretties always knew what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had promised Peris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally pulled back into the darkness, trying to ignore the horrible feeling that she was a spy, a sneak, for not surrendering to the woman\u0027s authority. She moved through the brush as fast as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose to the river, Tally heard a noise in front of her. A dark form was outlined in river lights before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a couple, a lone figure in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be a warden, waiting for her in the brush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally hardly dared breathe. She had frozen in midcrawl, her weight all poised on one knee and one muddy hand. The warden hadn\u0027t seen her yet. If Tally waited long enough, maybe the warden would move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited, motionless, for endless minutes. The figure didn\u0027t budge. They must know that the gardens were the only dark way in and out of New Pretty Town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally\u0027s arm started to shake, the muscles complaining about staying frozen for so long. But she didn\u0027t dare let her weight settle onto the other arm. The snap of a single twig would give her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held herself still, until all her muscles were screaming. Maybe the warden was just a trick of the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this was all in her imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally blinked, trying to make the figure disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was still there, clearly outlined by the rippling lights of the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twig popped under her knee - Tally\u0027s aching muscles had finally betrayed her. But the figurestill didn\u0027t move. He or she must have heard....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warden was being kind, waiting for her to give herself up. Letting her surrender. The teachers did that at school, sometimes. Made you realize that you couldn\u0027t escape, until you confessed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally cleared her throat. A small, pathetic sound. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure let out a sigh. \"Oh, phew. Hey, that\u0027s okay. I must have scared you, too.\" The girl leaned forward, grimacing as if she was also sore from remaining still so long. Her face caught the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was ugly too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name was Shay. She had long dark hair in pigtails, and her eyes were too wide apart. Her lips were full enough, but she was even skinnier than a new pretty. She\u0027d come over to New Pretty Town on her own expedition, and had been hiding here by the river for an hour. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything like this,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe whispered. \"There\u0027s wardens and hovercars everywhere!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally cleared her throat. \"I think it\u0027s my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay looked dubious. \"How\u0027d you manage that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was up in the middle of town, at a party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You crashed a party? That\u0027s crazy!\" Shay said, then lowered her voice back to a whisper. \"Crazy, but awesome. How\u0027d you get in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wearing a mask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. A pretty mask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, more like a pig mask. It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay blinked. \"A pig mask. Okay. So let me guess, someone blew your house down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? No. I was about to get caught, so I kind of...set off a fire alarm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice trick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally smiled. It was actually a pretty good story, now that she had someone to tell it to. \"And I was trapped up on the roof, so I grabbed a bungee jacket and jumped off. I hover-bounced halfway here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, part of the way here, anyhow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty awesome.\" Shay smiled, then her face went serious. She bit at one of her fingernails, which was one of those bad habits that the operation cured. \"So, Tally, were you at this party...to see someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Tally\u0027s turn to be impressed. \"How\u0027d you figure that out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay sighed, looking down at her ragged nails. \"I\u0027ve got friends too, over here. I mean, theywere friends. Sometimes I spy on them.\" She looked up. \"I was always the youngest, you know? And now - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay nodded. \"It\u0027s sounds like you did more than spy, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I kind of said hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, that\u0027s crazy. Your boyfriend or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally shook her head. Peris had gone with other girls, and Tally had dealt with it and tried to do the same, but their friendship had always been the main thing in both their lives. Not anymore, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027d been my boyfriend, I don\u0027t think I could have done it, you know? I wouldn\u0027t have wanted him to see my face. But because we\u0027re friends, I thought maybe...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. So how\u0027d it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally thought for a second, looking out at the rippling water. Peris had been so pretty, and grown-up looking, and he\u0027d said they\u0027d be friends again. Once Tally was pretty too...\"Basically, it sucked,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except getting away. That part was very cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like it.\" Tally heard the smile in Shay\u0027s voice. \"Very tricky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a moment as a hovercar went over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you know, we haven\u0027t totally gotten away yet,\" Shay said. \"Next time you\u0027re going to pull a fire alarm, let me know ahead of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about getting you trapped here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay looked at her and frowned. \"Not that. I just meant if I\u0027m going to have to do the running-away part, I might as well get in on the fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally laughed softly. \"Okay. Next time, I\u0027ll let you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please do.\" Shay scanned the river. \"Looks a little clearer now. Where\u0027s your board?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay pulled a hoverboard from under a bush. \"You\u0027ve got a board, right? What\u0027d you do, swim over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I...hey, wait. How\u0027d you get a hoverboard to take you across the river?\" Anything that flew had minders all over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay laughed. \"That\u0027s the oldest trick in the book. I figured you\u0027d know all about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally shrugged. \"I don\u0027t board much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this one\u0027ll take both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, shhh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hovercar had come into view, cruising down the river just above the height of the bridges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally waited for a count of ten after it had passed before she spoke. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea, flying back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So howdid you get over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me.\" Tally rose from her crouch onto hands and knees, and crawled a bit ahead. She looked back. \"Can you carry that thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. It doesn\u0027t weigh much.\" Shay snapped her fingers, and the hoverboard drifted upward. \"Actually, it doesn\u0027t weighanything, unless I tell it to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s handy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay started to crawl, the board bouncing along behind her like a littlie\u0027s balloon. Tally couldn\u0027t see any string, though. \"So, where\u0027re we going?\" Shay asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a bridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027ll tattle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this one. It\u0027s an old friend.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-3.html","bookId":1573,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM"}
