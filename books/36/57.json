And when You say, as You did in the other two books, “I will never punish you,” we cannot believe that—and some of us almost get mad about that.

The process of evolution has been on-going forever, of course. But now that process is taking a new twist. There’s a new turn here. Now you have be-come aware that you are evolving. And not only that you are evolving, but how. Now you know the process by which evolution occurs—and through which your re-ality is created.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore, you were simply an observer of how your species was evolving. Now you are a conscious partici-pant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMore people than ever before are aware of the power of the mind, their interconnectedness with all things, and their real identity as a spiritual being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMore people than ever before are living from that space, practicing principles that invoke and produce specific results, desired outcomes, and intended expe-riences.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis truly is an evolution revolution, for now larger and larger numbers of you are creating consciously the quality of your experience, the direct expression of Who You Really Are, and the rapid manifestation of Who You Choose to Be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what makes this such a critical period. That’s why this is the crucial moment. For the first time in your presently recorded history (although not for the first time in human experience), you have both the technol-ogy, and the understanding of how to use it, to destroy your entire world.

The writers of what you call your “sci-ence fiction” are often leading you to greater truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’ve got to stop here.

Book 1 said that, when acting with love, include yourself among those you love. And the book seemed to say, do whatever it takes to stop the attack on you. It even said that war was okay as a response to at-tack—that, and this is a direct quote: \" ..... despots cannot be al-lowed to flourish, but must be stopped in their despotism.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt also says that “choosing to be God-like does not mean you choose to be a martyr. And it certainly does not mean you choose to be a victim.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow You are saying that highly evolved beings would never end the corporal life of another.

In that statement you allow as to how you are not now operating at a level of mastery. You say that other people’s words and actions sometimes hurt you. Given that this is so, you asked how best to respond to these experiences of hurt or damage.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy responses are all to be taken within that context.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI first of all said that the day will come when the words and actions of others will not hurt you. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, you will experience no damage, even when someone is “killing” you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the level of mastery that has been reached by the members of the societies I am now describing. The beings in these societies are very clear Who They Are and who they are not. It is very difficult to cause one of them to experience being “damaged,” or “hurt,” least of all by placing their corporal body in danger. They would simply exit their body and leave it for you, if you felt the need to hurt it so much.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe next point I made in My response to you in Book 1 is that you react the way you do to the words and actions of others because you have forgotten Who You Are. But, I say there, that is all right. That is part of the growth process. It is part of evolution.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen I make a very important statement. All during your growth process “you must work at the level at which you are. The level of understanding, the level of willingness, the level of remembrance.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEverything else I have said there is to be taken within that context.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have even said, on page 129, “I assume for the pur-pose of this discussion that you are still ... seeking to re-alize (make ‘real’) Who You Truly Are.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithin the context of a society of beings who do not remember Who They Really Are, the responses I gave you in Book 1 stand as given. But you didn’t ask Me those questions here. You asked Me here to describe the highly evolved societies of the universe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot only with regard to the subject at hand, but with regard to all the other topics we will cover here, it will be beneficial if you do not see these descriptions of other cultures as criticisms of your own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are no judgments here. Nor will there be any condemnation if you do things differently—react differ-ently—than beings who are more evolved.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so what I have said here is that the highly evolved beings of the universe would never “kill” an-other sentient being in anger. First they would not ex-perience anger. Second, they would not end the corporal experience of any other being without that being’s permission. And third—to answer specifically your specific inquiry—they would never feel “at-tacked,” even from outside their own society or spe-cies, because to feel “attacked” you have to feel that someone is taking something from you—your life, your loved ones, your freedom, your property, or pos-sessions-something. And a highly evolved being would never experience that, because a highly evolved being would simply give you whatever you thought you needed so badly that you were prepared to take it by force—even if it cost the evolved being its corporal life—because the evolved being knows she can cre-ate everything all over again. She would quite natu-rally give it all away to a lesser being who did not know this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHighly evolved beings are therefore not martyrs, nor are they victims of anyone’s “despotism.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet it goes beyond this. Not only is the highly evolved being clear that he can create everything all over again, he is also clear that he doesn’t have to. He is clear that he needed none of it to be happy, or to sur-vive. He understands that he requires nothing exterior to himself, and that the “himself” which he is has noth-ing to do with anything physical.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLesser evolved beings and races are not always clear about this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the highly evolved being understands that she and her attackers are One. She sees the attackers as a wounded part of her Self. Her function in that circum-stance is to heal all wounds, so that the All In One can again know itself as it really is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGiving away all that she has would be like giving yourself an aspirin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. What a concept. What an understanding! But I need to go back to something You said earlier. You said that highly evolved beings—\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e—Let’s abbreviate that as “HEBs” from here on. It’s a long name to have to use over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGood. Well, You said that “HEBs” would never end the corporal experience of another being without the being’s per-mission.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut why would one being give another being permission to end its physical life?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere could be any number of reasons. It might of-fer itself as food, for instance. Or to serve some other necessity—like stopping a war.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis must be why, even in our own cultures, there are those who would not kill any animal for food or hides without asking the spirit of that being for permission.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. This is the way of your Native Americans, who would not even pick a flower, an herb, or a plant with-out having this communication. All of your indigenous cultures do the same. Interestingly, those are the tribes and cultures that you call “primitive.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, man, are You telling me I can’t even pick a radish with-out asking if it’s okay?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can do anything you choose to do. You asked Me what “HEBs” would do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo Native Americans are highly evolved beings?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs with all races and species, some are, and some are not. It is an individual thing. As a culture, though, they have reached a very high level. The cultural myths which inform much of their experience are very ele-vated. But, you have forced them to mix their cultural myths with your own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute! What are You saying? The Red Man was a savage! That’s why we had to kill them by the thousands, and put the rest in land-prisons we call reservations! Why, even now we take their sacred sites and put golf courses on them. We have to. Otherwise they might honor their sacred sites, and re-member their cultural stories, and perform their sacred rituals, and we can’t have that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI get the picture.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, really. Why, if we hadn’t taken over and tried to erase their culture, they might have impacted ours! Then how would we have wound up?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe’d be respecting the land and the air, refusing to poison our rivers, and then where would our industry be!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe whole population would probably still be walking around naked, with no shame, bathing in the river, living off the land, instead of crowding into high-rises and condomini-ums and bungalows and going to work in the asphalt jungle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhy, we’d probably still be listening to ancient wisdom teachings around a campfire instead of watching TV! We would have made no progress at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, fortunately, you know what’s good for you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/639.html","bookId":36,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:46:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:46:51 AM"}
