And I hate saltines. You know that. You know everything about me, even this, which is that I really love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, standing in front of him. I was out of breath. I felt like my heart would explode, it was so full. I pulled my hair into a ponytail with my hand and held it like that, still waiting for him to say something, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like a thousand years before he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well you shouldn\u0027t. I\u0027m not the one. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all he said. I let out a big breath of air and stared at him. \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" I said. \"You like me too; I know it.\" I\u0027d seen the way he\u0027d looked at me when I was with Cam, I\u0027d seen it with my own two eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the way you want me to,\" he said. He sighed, and in this sad way, like he felt sorry for me, he said, \"You\u0027re still such a kid, Belly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a kid anymore! You just wish I was, so that way you wouldn\u0027t have to deal with any of it. That\u0027s why you\u0027ve been mad at me this whole summer,\" I said, my voice getting louder. \"You do like me. Admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy,\" he said, laughing a little as he walked away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not this time. I wasn\u0027t going to let him off the hook that easily. I was sick and tired of his brooding James Dean routine. He had feelings for me. I knew it. I was going to make him say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed his shirt sleeve. \"Admit it. You were mad when I started hanging out with Cam .You wanted me to still be your little admirer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He shook me off. \"Get your head out of your ass, Belly. The world doesn\u0027t revolve around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flamed bright red; I could feel the heat beneath my skin. It was like a sunburn times a million. \"Yes, exactly, because the world revolves around you, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\" There was a warning in his voice, but I didn\u0027t stop to listen. I was too mad. I was finally saying what I really thought, and there was no turning back now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept getting in his face. I wasn\u0027t going to let him walk away from me, not this time. \"You just want to keep me on this hook, right? So I\u0027ll keep chasing after you and you can feel good about yourself. As soon as I start to get over you, you just reel me back in. You\u0027re so screwed up in the head. But I\u0027m telling you, Conrad, this is it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snapped, \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hair whipped around my face as I spun around to walk backward, facing him. \"This is it. You don\u0027t get to have me anymore. Not as your friend or your admirer or anything. I\u0027m through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twisted. \"What do you want from me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have your little boyfriend to play with now, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and backed away from him. \"It\u0027s not like that,\" I said. He\u0027d gotten it all wrong. That wasn\u0027t what I was trying to do. He\u0027d been the one stringing me along, like, my whole life. He knew how I felt, and he let me love him. He wanted me to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped closer to me. \"One minute you like me. Then Cam ...\" Conrad paused. \"And then Jeremiah. Isn\u0027t that right? You want to have your cake and eat it too, but you also want your cookies, and your ice cream . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s been playing games, Belly.\" He was trying to sound casual, offhand, but his body was tense, like every muscle was as tight as his stupid guitar strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been an ass all summer. All you think about is yourself. So your parents are getting divorced! So what? People\u0027s parents get divorced. It\u0027s not an excuse to treat people like crap!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snapped his head away from me. \"Shut your mouth,\" he said, and his jaw twitched. I had finally done it. I was getting to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susannah was crying the other day because of you-- she could barely get out of bed! Do you even care? Do you even know how selfish you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad stepped up close to me, so close our faces were nearly touching, like he might either hit me or kiss me. I could hear my heart pounding in my ears. I was so mad I almost wished he\u0027d hit me. I knew he\u0027d never do it, not in a million years. He grabbed my arms and shook me, and then he let go just as suddenly. I could feel tears building up, because for a second there, I thought he might. Kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was crying when Jeremiah walked up. He\u0027d been at work lifeguarding; his hair was still wet. I didn\u0027t even hear his car pull up. He took one look at the two of us, and he knew something bad was happening. He almost looked scared. And then he just looked furious. He said, \"What the hell is going on? Conrad, what\u0027s your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad glared at him. \"Just keep her away from me. I\u0027m not in the mood to deal with any of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched. It was like he really had hit me. It was worse than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to walk away, and Jeremiah grabbed his arm. \"You need to start dealing with this, man. You\u0027re acting like a jerk. Quit taking your anger out on everybody else. Leave Belly alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered. Was this because of me? All summer, Conrad\u0027s moodiness, locking himself up in his room-- had it really been because of me? Was it more than just his parents divorcing? Had he been that upset over seeing me with someone else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad tried to shrug him off. \"Why don\u0027t you leave me alone? How about we try that instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jeremiah wouldn\u0027t let go. He said, \"We\u0027ve been leaving you alone. We\u0027ve left you alone this whole summer, getting drunk and sulking like a little kid. You\u0027re supposed to be the older one, right? The big brother? Act like it, dumbass. Freaking man up and handle your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my face,\" Conrad growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Jeremiah stepped closer, until their faces were inches apart, just like ours had been not fifteen minutes before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a dangerous voice Conrad said, \"I\u0027m warning you, Jeremiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them were like two angry dogs, growling and spitting and circling each other. They\u0027d forgotten I was there. I felt like I was watching something I shouldn\u0027t, like I was spying. I wanted to put my hands over my ears. They\u0027d never been like this with each other in all the time I\u0027d known them. They might have argued, but it had never been like this, not once. I knew I should leave, but I couldn\u0027t bring myself to do it. I just stood there on the periphery, holding my arms close to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just like Dad, you know that?\" Jeremiah shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I knew it had nothing to do with me. This was bigger than anything I could be a part of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was something I knew nothing about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad pushed Jeremiah away roughly, and Jeremiah pushed him back. Conrad stumbled and nearly fell, and when he rose up, he punched Jeremiah right in the face. I think I screamed. Then they were wrestling around, grabbing at each other, hitting and cursing and breathing heavy. They knocked over Susannah\u0027s big glass jar of sun tea, and it cracked open. Tea spilled out all over the porch. There was blood on the sand. I didn\u0027t know whose it was. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-41.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
