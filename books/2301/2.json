I\u0027d like to buy everything he\u0027s written.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might want to narrow that down a little,” I said drily. “Jordan Montgomery has written something like fifty books in the last twenty years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll take whatever you have on hand,” Raphael said. “And please order me the rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t have to buy all those books just because you feel sorry for me,” I said waspishly. “And you didn\u0027t have to tell your friends to come in here, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” he murmured, a guilty smile twitching at the corners of his lips. “Don\u0027t tell me they all came tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know about that, since I don\u0027t know how many you asked to show up,” I replied, and then, as my exasperation faded, I wondered what was going on that there were so many Vampires in town at one time, which made me wonder if that meant an equal number of Werewolves were also prowling the dark streets. The thought sent a cold chill slithering down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced out the window, wondering if the moon was full, and if it was safe to walk home now that the town was full of Vampires and Werewolves. Funny that they were enemies. You\u0027d think they would go hunting together, I thought morbidly, since one drank blood and the other devoured flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss McKenna?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Oh, right, the books.” I walked toward the back of the store where the mysteries were shelved, acutely aware that Raphael was following me. I wasn\u0027t sure I liked having a Vampire, even a remarkably sexy, handsome one, at my back. Or anywhere else in the vicinity, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had sixteen of Montgomery\u0027s backlist in stock, all in hardback. Assuming Cordova read a book a night, I figured I wouldn\u0027t be seeing him again for a couple of weeks. The thought left me feeling curiously depressed, but I told myself it was a good thing. After all, who needs a Vampire hanging around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped me carry the books to the front of the store, then handed me his credit card. I stared at it for a moment. Somehow, I had never imagined that Vampires carried credit cards. Apparently, I had a lot to learn about the ways and means of the Undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly rang up the books and gave him a copy of the receipt to sign. His signature was a bold scrawl across the bottom of the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loaded the books into four shopping bags and pushed them across the counter. “Happy reading.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” He started to turn away, then hesitated. “Would you care to have dinner with me some evening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, my mind filling with images of Raphael Cordova bending over me, his fangs poised at my throat. “No, I don\u0027t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn\u0027t ask you to be dinner,” he said with a knowing grin. “But if the thought of dining with me makes you uncomfortable, perhaps we could go out for a drink.” He held up a hand, silencing the protest he must have read in my eyes. “No blood involved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I hated to admit it, I was tempted. I hadn\u0027t been out on a date in almost six months. I didn\u0027t know anyone else in town. And Raphael Cordova intrigued me more than any man I had ever met. But still…what was the point in dating a Vampire? I opened my mouth to say, “No, thank you,” so you can imagine my surprise when I heard myself say, “Yes, I\u0027d like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow night, perhaps?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” Tomorrow was Thursday. I closed the shop at seven during the week, at nine on Fridays and Saturdays. I was closed on Sundays, like every other business in town except for the gas station/mini-mart located over on Ninth Street, which was open 24-7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall I pick you up here, or at your home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here will be fine,” I said, uncomfortable at the thought of letting a Vampire know where I lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until tomorrow night, then.” He smiled at me, then left the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared after him, wondering what I was getting myself into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up Thursday morning feeling jittery inside, a condition that grew steadily worse with each passing tick of the clock. I took a long shower, spent half an hour applying my makeup and doing my hair, and another twenty minutes trying to decide what to wear. Since Raphael was picking me up at the store, I wouldn\u0027t have time to come home and change for our date later. In the end, I settled on a pair of white slacks and a green turtleneck sweater that made my eyes look a shade darker than they were. I wondered if Raphael liked green eyes. The word Vampire whispered through my mind, sending me to my jewelry box where I kept a gold crucifix, not because I was Catholic, but because crosses were supposed to repel Vampires. I had worn it constantly in New York, but it hadn\u0027t seemed necessary here in Oak Hollow until I met Raphael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fastened the chain around my neck, then took a last look in the mirror, wishing my hair was curly and black instead of long and straight and blond. I slipped into my comfy work shoes, grabbed a pair of white high-heeled sandals to change into for my date with the Undead, scooped up my handbag and my keys, and headed to the bookstore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, I had several ordinary customers that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them, Susie McGee, was the down-to-earth, outgoing, friendly type. She had a pretty, heart-shaped face, short, dark curly hair, bright blue eyes, and a harried expression. She was about five feet three inches tall, making her two inches shorter than I was. After she paid for her purchases, she lingered at the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a great place,” she said, looking around. “We\u0027ve needed a bookstore for donkey\u0027s years, but we\u0027re not really big enough to interest a Barnes \u0026amp; Noble or a Borders, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, keeping one eye on her three boys, who were playing hide-and-seek in the aisles. They were cute kids. I estimated they were all under the age of seven. They all had their mother\u0027s dark curly hair and blue eyes. After twenty minutes of watching them run around my store, I knew why their mother looked stressed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just love to read,” Susie went on. “After a day of looking after my monsters, I need a little time to myself. Of course, the only place I can be by myself is in the bathroom. I call it my reading room,” she said with a laugh, and then she sighed. “Honestly, the only time I have to call my own is on the john. Or in the tub. Well, listen to me, running on like that. I\u0027d best be going. Bobby, you stop pulling your brother\u0027s hair! Jeremy, put that bear back on the shelf.” She looked at me and shook her head. “Honestly, all those kids do is fight! It was nice to meet you, Miss McKenna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kathy, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a smile, Susie gathered up her books and her brood and left the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the clock. It was a quarter to seven. Since Raphael was only taking me out for a drink, I had eaten a late lunch. But even if I hadn\u0027t, I was much too nervous to think about food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned off the outside lights, locked the cash drawer, then went into the back room to change my shoes. I didn\u0027t hear the bell over the door ring, but I knew the moment Raphael arrived. I\u0027m not sure how I knew. Women\u0027s intuition, a change in the atmosphere, a sudden internal awareness, I don\u0027t know. I just knew he was there, the same way I had known that he was a Vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran a hand over my hair, took a deep breath, and made my way toward the front of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordova turned to face me, and I felt my breath catch in my throat. Lordy, the man was breathtaking! He wore a white shirt open at the throat, black slacks, and boots. His hair gleamed blue-black in the overhead light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a blush warm my cheeks as his gaze moved over me, the look in his eyes telling me he liked what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, Miss McKenna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might as well call me Kathy,” I suggested somewhat breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kathy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of my name on his lips sent a shiver down my spine, made me think of warm bodies intimately entwined on cool satin sheets. Maybe letting him call me by my given name wasn\u0027t such a good idea, after all. I touched the crucifix at my throat to give me strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael observed the gesture with a wry grin. “The belief that crosses scare off Vampires is an old wives\u0027 tale,” he remarked. “In any event, it isn\u0027t the cross that wards off the Vampire, but the wearer\u0027s belief in the power of good over evil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn\u0027t know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then you have to ask yourself, what if he\u0027s Jewish or Hindu?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms under my breasts. “Now you\u0027re making fun of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Not really. In any case, if you feel the need to wear one, it should be silver.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What difference does that make?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Silver burns Vampire flesh, gold does not. Not only that, but silver renders us powerless if we\u0027re bound with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI filed that bit of useful information away for future reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready to go?” He glanced at the crucifix again. “Or have you changed your mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven\u0027t changed my mind,” I said. “Just give me a minute to lock up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed me to the door, waited on the sidewalk while I turned off the interior lights and set the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I slipped my keys into my handbag, he offered me his arm in a rather courtly gesture and walked me to his car, something sleek and black that looked like it was going a hundred miles an hour even when it was parked at the curb. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-2.html","bookId":2301,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM"}
