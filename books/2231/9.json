Her eyes opened in surprise when she saw Carella and Brown sitting on the bench. She broke step, stopped, looked at them, shook her head, and said, \"What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to bother you again,\" Carella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever see this?\" he asked, and handed her a copy of the letter Shanahan had passed on to him late yesterday afternoon. Connie took it, began reading it, recognized it at once, and handed it back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"So?,\" and hurried past them to the exit door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came down the steps and into the street, Connie leading, glancing at her watch, walking quickly to the curb, looking up the avenue for a taxi. It was eight-thirty in the morning on a very cold day, the sky bright and cloudless overhead, the streets heavy with traffic. At this hour, it was almost impossible to catch a free cab, but the buses were packed as well, and getting anywhere was a slow and tedious process. Connie kept waving her hand at approaching taxis, shaking her head as each occupied one flashed by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to be downtown in ten minutes,\" she said. \"Whatever this is, I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll have to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woman who wrote that letter was murdered,\" Carella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, what is this?\" Connie said. \"The Scottish Play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the Scottish Play?\" Brown asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to talk to you,\" Carella said. \"If you want a lift downtown, we\u0027ll be happy to take you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what?\" she said. \"A police car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice Dodge sedan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shotgun on the back seat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the trunk,\" Brown said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Connie said, and they began walking toward where Carella had parked the car, around the corner. She was in good shape; they had to step fast to keep up with her. Carella unlocked the door on the driver\u0027s side, clicked open all the other doors, and then threw up the visor with the pink police notice on it. Connie sat beside him on the front seat. Brown climbed into the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\" Carella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Octagon,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve been there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More auditions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Endless process,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know this woman, you realize.

Too long a nose, in fact. Suffice it to say that plagiarism victims surface whenever anything smells of success. I turned the letter over to my lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he contact her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She. I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I care? We\u0027re talking about a play written in 1922!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re also talking about a play that seems to inspire murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnie turned to him, her face sharp in profile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that for sure,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the two murders are in any way connected. I suppose you\u0027d both take a fit if I smoked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go right ahead,\" Carella said, surprising Brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fished into her bag, came up with a single cigarette and a lighter. She flicked the lighter into flame, held it to the end of the cigarette. She breathed out a cloud of smoke, sighed in satisfaction. On the back seat, Brown opened a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what it looks like,\" she said. \"Hale refuses to sell us the rights, so he gets killed. Woman writes a letter that could seem threatening to the show, and she gets killed. Somebody wanted both of them dead because the show must go on\" she said, raising her voice dramatically. \"Well, I have news for you. The show doesn\u0027t always have to go on. If it gets too difficult or too complicated, it simply does not go on, and that\u0027s a fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the show is going on,\" Brown said. \"And that\u0027s a fact, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But if you think any of the professionals involved in this project would kill to insure a production . . .\" She shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the amateurs?\" Carella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it was better to deal with professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA professional knew what he was doing, and if he broke the rules it was only because he understood them so well. The amateur witnessed a murder or two on television, concluded he didn\u0027t have to know the rules, he could just jump in cold and do a little murder of his own. The amateur believed that even if he didn\u0027t know what he was doing, he could get away with it. The professional believed he had best know what he was doing or he\u0027d get caught. In fact, the professional knew without question that if he didn\u0027t get better and better each time out, eventually they\u0027d nail him. The irony was that there were more amateurs than professionals running around loose out there, each and every one of them thriving. Go figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way Carella and Brown figured it, there were four amateurs involved in the musical production of Jenny\u0027s Room, and three of them were still here in this busy little city. The fourth was somewhere in Tel Aviv, driving his taxi through crowded streets and hoping a bus bomb wouldn\u0027t explode in his path. There was nothing that said an Israeli cab driver couldn\u0027t have hired a Jamaican from Houston to hang an old man in his closet and later break an old lady\u0027s neck, but that sounded like the kind of stuff a neophyte might devise. Distance also would have disqualified Felicia Carr from Los Angeles and Gerald Palmer from London had they not both been here in the city when Martha Coleridge had her neck snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCynthia Keating always loomed first and foremost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMousy little Cynthia, who\u0027d hoisted her father off that bathroom door hook and lugged him over to the bed. Dear little Cynthia, who\u0027d been worried about a suicide clause depriving her of a lousy twenty-five grand when there were hundreds of thousands to be coined in a hit musical?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey already knew where they could find Cynthia Keating. They knew that Palmer was staying at The Piccadilly because he\u0027d mentioned it at Connie Lindstrom\u0027s party. From the ever helpful Norman Zimmer, they learned that Felicia Carr was staying with a girlfriend here in the city. Because both Felicia and Palmer were leaving for their respective homes this weekend and time was running out, they split the legwork into three teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether a person was guilty or not, he or she always seemed surprised - and a little bit frightened - to find policemen standing on the doorstep. Felicia Carr opened the door to her girlfriend\u0027s garden apartment in Majesta, saw two burly men standing there flashing badges, opened her big green eyes wide and asked what seemed to be the trouble, Officers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re investigating a homicide,\" Meyer said, because that often caused amateurs to wet their pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A double homicide, in fact,\" Kling said genially. \"May we come in, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . sure,\" Felicia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed her into a spacious, sunny living room overlooking the Majesta Bridge not far in the distance. The furniture was still wearing summer slipcovers, the fabric all abloom with riotous red and yellow and purple flowers against a background of large green leaves. The summery decor, the sun glaring through the big windows made the day outside appear balmy. But the temperature was in the low twenties, and the forecasters had predicted more snow either late tonight or early tomorrow morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicia told them she was just on her way out. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much to see here,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . and hoped this wouldn\u0027t take too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though I\u0027m sorry to hear someone got murdered,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two people,\" Kling reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Carr,\" Meyer said, \"can you tell us where you were this past Sunday night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This past Sunday night,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would\u0027ve been the fifth,\" Kling said helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell us where you were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a homicide investigation,\" Meyer said, and smiled encouragingly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that got to do with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most likely nothing,\" Kling said, and nodded regretfully, as if to say / know you had nothing to do with these murders, and you know you had nothing to do with them, but we have to ask these questions, you see, that\u0027s our job. But Felicia Carr was from the motion picture capital of the universe. She had seen every cop movie ever made, every cop television show ever broadcast, and she wasn\u0027t about to get snowed by a song-and-dance team doing a dog-and-pony act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, most likelyT she snapped. \"Why do you want to know where I was on Sunday night? Is that when someone got killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss,\" Kling said, trying to look even more sorrowful, but the lady still wasn\u0027t buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this?\" she said. \"Los Angeles? The LAPD Gestapo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know a woman named Martha Coleridge?\" Meyer asked. Bad Cop suddenly on the scene. No more smile on his face. Bald head making him look like an executioner with an ax. Arms folded across his chest in unmistakably hostile body language. Blue eyes studying her coldly. Didn\u0027t know he was dealing with Wonder Woman here, who\u0027d sold three houses in Westwood only two weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, who\u0027s Martha Coleridge?\" she asked. \"Is she the person who got killed last Sunday? Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Carr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know her. I never heard of her. Is that enough? I have to leave now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Few more questions,\" Kling said gently. \"If you can spare a minute or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood Cop with the flaxen hair and the hazel eyes and the cheeks still glowing from the cold outside, gently and persuasively trying to lead the lady down the garden path, not taking into account that she was from Tinseltown, USA, where if people ever walked anywhere they actually waited on street corners for lights to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re allowed to do this,\" she said. \"Barge in here and . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Carr, have you ever been to Texas?\" Meyer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have.

I never met him, but I know his name. Someone mentioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who mentioned it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cynthia, I think. He was her father, wasn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did she happen to mention it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something about underlying rights? I really can\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you say you don\u0027t know anyone named Martha Coleridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you get a letter from her recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A letter.

Are you telling me she\u0027s the same person who got killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman Zimmer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Is she the one . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d you send it to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured he\u0027d know what to do about it. He\u0027s the producer, isn\u0027t he? What do I know about a crazy old lady who wrote a play in 1922?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Kling said politely. \"But what do you mean you sent it back to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it was addressed to me care of his office.

Decked out for Christmas as she was, the city petulantly demanded snow. Store windows were decorated with fake snow, and there were fake Salvation Army Santas shaking beUs in front of fake chimneys on every other street corner. But this was already the ninth of December and Christmas Day was fast approaching. What the city needed now was a real Santa soaring over the rooftops, real snow falling gently from the sky above. What the city needed was a sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she was telling the truth,\" Kling said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" Meyer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where was she lying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She gets a letter threatening legal action, and she forgets the woman\u0027s name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Says she never heard of her, quote, unquote.

She\u0027s the one who wrote a letter that can only deprive me of early retirement.\" He snapped the niobile phone from its cradle, held it out to Kling. \"Call this Shirley Lasser,\" he said, \"tell her we\u0027re on the way. Six to five her pal\u0027s already been on the pipe, telling her they saw a Travolta movie together last Sunday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKling began dialing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder which one it was,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing that Jamaicans slept ten, twelve to a room, Fat Ollie Weeks did not consider it beyond the realm of possibility that a Jamaican visitor from Houston, Texas, might have crashed with friends or relatives now residing in this fair city, ah yes. Further knowing that the Jamaican in question had picked up Althea Cleary in a diner in the Eight-Eight, he took a run at the precinct\u0027s own Jamaican enclave, The Forbes Houses on Noonan and Crowe - and came up empty. Undaunted, but unwilling to do a door-to-door canvass of the city\u0027s six other Jamaican neighborhoods, he headed for the largest of them, downtown in the Three-Two Precinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere in the old city, narrow, twisting little streets with Florida-sounding names like Lime, Hibiscus, Pelican, Manatee, and Heron ran into similarly cramped little lanes and alleys called Goedkoop, Keulen, Sprenkels, and Visser, named by the Dutch when the city was new and masted sailing ships lay in the harbor. Them days was gone forever, Gertie. Running eastward from the Straits of Napoli and Chinatown, Visser Street swerved to the north into what used to be an area of warehouses bordering the River Harb. Too far uptown to be considered Lower Platform, not far enough downtown to be a part of trendy Hopscotch, the newly erected projects here were officially called The Mapes Houses, after James Joseph Mapes, a revered former Governor of the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the city\u0027s projects were rated by the police department on a one-to-five scale ranging from \"uncertain\" to \"chancy\" to \"risky\" to \"unsafe\" to downright \"hazardous.\" The Mapes Houses were classified a middling three on the Safety Factor scale, although foot patrolmen assigned to the area considered this a conservative ranking. The cops of the Three-Two dubbed the project \"Rockfort,\" after a seventeenth-century moated fortress on the easternmost limits of Kingston, but perhaps that was only because eighty percent of the residents here were Jamaican.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Fat Ollie Weeks\u0027s scale of personal safety, Rockfort ranked a dismal eight, which in his lexicon meant shitty, mon. He went in there alone early that Thursday afternoon, but only because it was broad daylight a few weeks before Christmas. Otherwise, he\u0027d have requested backup and a SWAT team. Abandoning his usual swagger, which he felt might be a liability here among the Jamaican brethren, ah yes, his manner became almost obsequious as he went from door to door asking after a man some six foot, two or three inches tall, with a fawn-colored complexion, deep brown eyes, wide shoulders, a narrow waist, a lovely grin, and a melodic Jamaican lilt to his voice. He did not mention the blue star tattooed on the suspect\u0027s penis because many of the people he spoke to were women, and many of the men considered themselves Christians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not strike pay dirt until three that afternoon, by which time it was beginning to snow and the skies above were dark enough to cause him to consider going back uptown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCynthia Keating did not seem surprised to find Carella and Brown on her doorstep yet another time. She didn\u0027t even threaten calling her lawyer. She asked them to come in, told them they had ten minutes, and then sat opposite them, crossing her legs and folding her arms across her chest. It had begun snowing, and the window behind her was alive with wind-driven flakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarella got directly to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A woman named Martha Coleridge,\" he said, \"mailed some letters to Norman Zimmer\u0027s office, asking that they be forwarded. One of them was addressed to you, as owner of the underlying rights to Jenny\u0027s Room. With it was a photocopy of a play Miss Coleridge herself had written. Did you ever receive that play and the accompanying letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgress, Carella thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you feel about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it seemed to me there were similarities between her play and Jenny\u0027s Room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of similarities?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the premise, to begin with. An immigrant girl comes to America and falls in love with someone of another faith while at the same time she\u0027s falling in love with the city itself - which she finally chooses over the man. That\u0027s identical in both plays. And the conceit. We see her love affair with the city through the window of her room, which is really a window to her heart. That\u0027s the same, too. Reading it was . . . well . . . alarming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027d you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called Todd.

Carella caught the hesitation, and so did Brown. Their eyes revealed nothing, but they had caught it. Her fleeting inner debate apparently led to a decision to tell the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I did not forget about it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth inevitably led to another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do instead?\" Brown asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the slight hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to see her,\" Cynthia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detectives did not know why she was telling the truth - if indeed this was the truth. The woman they were here to inquire about was dead, and anything that had transpired between her and Cynthia Keating could neither be confirmed nor contradicted. But the path of evident truth was the one Cynthia seemed to have chosen, and they thanked God for small favors and plunged ahead regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was this?\" Carella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The day after I received the play.

Her play couldn\u0027t have been a fake, she\u0027d sent us a program with the name of the theater on it, the date the play opened, how could she have faked all that? And if she wasn\u0027t faking, then her play was the model for Jenny\u0027s Room. There was no question in my mind about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you went there to deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To explore a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even though your lawyer advised against it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, lawyers,\" she said, and dismissed the entire legal profession with a wave of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she have in mind exactly?\" Brown asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cash settlement of one million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked you for a million dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the total sum she wanted from all of us.

A pot of greens in garlic and oil was simmering on another burner. Something succulent was roasting in the oven, too. The woman was barefoot, wearing a loose-fitting smock with a floral design, a matching pink kerchief on her head. The kitchen was small and tidy, the cooking smells overpowering. Ollie was suddenly very hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name, would you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never heerd his name,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aroun dee projec, like I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those?\" he asked. \"Fried bananas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, mon, fried bananas, wot you tink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do they taste?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Them fried bananas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lak to taste one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They sure look good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They be done soon,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOllie watched the butter bubbling around them in the pan.

Carella had some dim recollection that the place used to be a riding academy in the not-too-distant past, before the new mayor started cracking down on hookers using hot-bed hotels for their swift transactions. The place still had a look of seedy weariness about it, the drapes and matching bedspread a trifle shabby, the arms on both easy chairs beginning to look a bit threadbare. Carella sat in one of those chairs, Brown in the other. Palmer stood on the far side of the bed, facing them, carrying clothes from the dresser and the closet to his open suitcase on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brown suit, a canary-colored shirt with a white collar, a fresh pair of Jockey shorts, brown socks, and a brown silk tie were laid out neatly on the bed. Palmer explained that he\u0027d set them aside for when he went out to dinner and a play tonight. He named the play - which neither of the detectives had seen, or even heard of - and explained that Norman Zimmer had arranged for house seats at the Ferguson Theater, all of this in the Cockney accent that made him sound like a bad imitation of an Englishman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So to what do I owe the honor of this visit?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know a woman named Martha Coleridge?\" Brown said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know of her,\" Palmer said, \"but I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve had the pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you receive a letter from her recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh indeed I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accompanying a play called My Room, and a copy of the opening night program?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.

Again, Carella had the feeling he was imitating someone, perhaps a comic he\u0027d seen on a music hall stage, perhaps a silly comedian in a movie. Or perhaps he was merely stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you call her or anything?\" Brown asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, no!\" Palmer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t think it was worth a call, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you talk to either Cynthia Keating or Felicia Carr about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mention it to Mr Zimmer?

Ollie was the only one there who thought the coffee tasted vile. Over the years, the others had come to believe the coffee didn\u0027t taste too bad at all, was in fact the sort of gourmet coffee one might find in little sidewalk cafes in Paris or Seattle. Ollie almost spit out his first sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was there to tell them what he had learned downtown at Rockfort. The four detectives listening to him were Carella, Brown, Meyer, and Kling, who\u0027d been dogging various aspects of this case for what seemed forever but was in actuality only since October 29. Ollie felt somewhat like a guest on a talk show. Carella was the host, and the others were earlier guests who\u0027d moved over to make room for Ollie when he\u0027d come on to exuberant whistling and thunderous applause. Brown and Meyer were sitting on chairs they\u0027d pulled over from their own desks. Kling was sitting on one corner of Carella\u0027s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a nice cozy little talk show here, with the temperature outside hovering at somewhere between twenty and twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit, which came to six or seven below zero Celsius, more or less, good to be inside on a night like tonight. The clock on the squadroom wall read a quarter past five, or 1715, depending on your point of view. Ollie had called from downtown right after he\u0027d spoken to Mr Michael and then again to the lady who\u0027d offered him another banana, asking Carella to wait for him, he\u0027d be right there. That had been at ten to four. The snow had delayed Ollie, what can you do, an act of God, he explained. It was still snowing, the flying flakes spattering against the squadroom windows like ghosts desperately seeking entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way I understood it,\" Ollie said, \"Bridges was there with his cousin for a week or so at the beginning of November. Rec room guy remembers him coming in to practice his saxophone. I figure this was after he done the Hale murder and before he flew back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rec room guy told you all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not about the murder, that\u0027s my surmise. He didn\u0027t know anything about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cousin, the sax, him flying back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you talk to the cousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knocked on the door, no answer. But I figured this was important enough to get moving on it right away. Which is why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you the sax player\u0027s name was John Bridges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rec room guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And told you he\u0027d flown back home to Houston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes and no,\" Ollie said, and grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us guess, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did not fly home to Houston, Texas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then where did he go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Euston, England. Sounds the same, ah yes, but it\u0027s spelled different. E-U-S-T-O-N. That\u0027s a locality, is what they call it in London. I went back to my lady who cooks fried bananas . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" Carella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lady in the project, her name is Sarah Crawford, she cooks great fried bananas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOllie felt he now had their complete attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s Jamaican, she told me all about Euston and also King\u0027s Cross - which is a nearby ward, is what they call it in London - where there are lots of hookers, drug dealers, and train stations. She didn\u0027t know Bridges personally, but his cousin told her he lived in Euston. So that\u0027s it, ah yes,\" Ollie said. \"You know anybody else from London?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waiting outside the Ferguson Theater when Gerald Palmer showed up for the eight o\u0027clock performance that night. He was wearing a dark blue overcoat over the brown suit, canary-colored, white-collared shirt, and brown silk tie they\u0027d seen on his bed earlier that day. His hair and the shoulders of the coat were dusted with snow. He opened his blue eyes wide when he saw Carella and Brown standing there near the ticket taker, waiting for him. There was a blond woman on his arm. She looked puzzled when the detectives approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr Palmer,\" Carella said, \"would you mind coming along with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Few questions we\u0027d like to ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if trying to impress the blonde - or perhaps because he was merely stupid - Palmer assumed the same wide-eyed, smirky, defiant look they\u0027d seen on his face earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awfully sorry,\" he said. \"I have other plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do we,\" Brown said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blonde accepted Palmer\u0027s gracious offer to go see the play alone while he took care of this \"silly business,\" as he called it, still playing the Prime Minister dealing with a pair of cheeky reporters. All the way uptown, he kept complaining about the police in this city, telling them they had no right treating a foreigner this way, which of course they had every right in the world to do, the law applying equally to citizens and visitors alike unless they had diplomatic immunity. They read him his rights the moment he was in custody. These were vastly different from those mandated in the UK, but he had no familiarity with either, as he explained to them, never having been in trouble with the law in his life. In fact, he could not understand why he seemed to be in police custody now, which was the same old song they\u0027d heard over the centuries from ax murderers and machine-gun Kellys alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of deference to his foreign status, they sat him down in the lieutenant\u0027s office, which was more comfortable than the interrogation room, and offered him some of Miscolo\u0027s coffee, or a cup of tea, if that was his preference. In response, he affected his Eyes Wide Open, Eyebrows Raised, Lips Pursed in Indignation look again, and told them there was no need to presume stereotypical behavior, in that he rarely drank tea and in fact much preferred coffee as his beverage of preference, redundantly sounding exactly like the sort of Englishman he was trying not to sound like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So tell us, Mr Palmer,\" Carella said. \"Do you know anyone named John Bridges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Who is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think he may have killed Andrew Hale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, am I supposed to know who Andrew Hale is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to know only what you know,\" Carella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, brilliant,\" Palmer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s from Euston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andrew Hale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John Bridges.

At the very least, they figured they were cool with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Nellie advised them to pick up Cynthia Keating and bring her in. She herself got there in half an hour.
