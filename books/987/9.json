{"id":43042,"no":9,"title":"THE HISTORY OF A FALL","content":"\u0026nbsp;MERE English will not do justice to the event. Let us attempt it according to the custom of the French. Thus and so following: \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Listen to a history of the most painful—and of the most true. You others, the Governors, the Lieutenant-Governors, and the Commissionaires of the Oriental Indias.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is you, foolishly outside of the truth in prey to illusions so blind that I of them remain so stupefied—it is to you that I address myself!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Know you Sir Cyril Wollobie, K.C.S.I., C.M.G., and all the other little things?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was of the Sacred Order of Yourself—a man responsible enormously—charged of the conservation of millions....\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 59]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of people. That is understood. The Indian Government conserves not its rupees.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was the well-loved of kings. I have seen the Viceroy—which is the Lorr-Maire—embrace him of both arms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That was in Simla. All things are possible in Simla.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even embraces.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His wife! Mon Dieu, his wife!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The aheuried imagination prostrates itself at the remembrance of the splendours Orientals of the Lady Cyril—the very respectable the Lady Wollobie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That was in Simla. All things are possible in Simla. Even wives. In those days I was—what you call—a Schnobb. I am now a much larger Schnobb. Voila the only difference. Thus it is true that travel expands the mind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But let us return to our Wollobies.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I admired that man there with the both hands. I crawled before the Lady Wollobie—platonically. The man the most brave would be only platonic towards that lady. And I[Pg 60] was also afraid. Subsequently I went to a dance. The wine equalled not the splendour of the Wollobies. Nor the food. But there was upon the floor an open space—large and park-like. It protected the dignity Wollobi-callisme. It was guarded by Aides-de-Camp. With blue silk in their coat-tails—turned up. With pink eyes and white moustaches to ravish. Also turned up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To me addressed himself an Aide-de-Camp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That was in Simla. To-day I do not speak to Aides-de-Camp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I confine myself exclusively to the cab-drivaire. He does not know so much bad language, but he can drive better.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I approached, under the protection of the Aide-de-Camp, the luminosity of Sir Wollobie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The world entire regarded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The band stopped. The lights burned blue. A domestic dropped a plate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was an inspiring moment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the summit of Jakko forty-five monkies looked down upon the crisis.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sir Wollobie spoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 61]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To me in that expanse of floor cultured and park-like. He said: \"I have long desired to make your acquaintance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The blood bouilloned in my head. I became pink. I was aneantied under the weight of an embarras insubrimable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At that moment Sir Wollobie became oblivious of my personality. That was his custom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wiping my face upon my coat-tails I refugied myself among the foules.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I had been spoken to by Sir Wollobie. That was in Simla. That also is history.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pass now several years. To the day before yesterday!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This also is history—farcical, immense, tragi-comic, but true.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Know you the Totnam Cortrode?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here lives Maple, who sells washing appliances and tables of exotic legs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here voyages also a Omnibuse Proletariat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That is to say for One penny.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Two pence is the refined volupté of the Aristocrat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 62]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am of the people.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Entre nous the connection is not desired by us. The people address to me epithets, entirely unprintable. I reply that they should wash. The situation is strained. Hence the Strike Docks and the Demonstrations Laborious.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upon the funeste tumbril of the Proletariat I take my seat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I demand air outside upon the roof.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will have all my penny.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tumbril advances.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A man aged loses his equilibrium and deposits himself into my lap.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Following the custom of the Brutal Londoner I demand the Devil where he shoves himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He apologises supplicatorically.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I grunt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Encore the tumbril shakes herself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I appropriate the desired seat of the old man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The conductaire cries to loud voice: \"Fare, Guvnor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He produces one penny.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 63]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A reminiscence phantasmal provokes itself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I beat him on the back.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is Sir Wollobie; the ex-Everything!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Also the ex-Everything else!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Figure you the situation!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He clasps my hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As a child clasps the hand of its nurse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He demands of me particular rensignments of my health. It is to him a matter important.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Other time he regulated the health of forty-five millions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I riposte. I enquire of his liver—his pancreas, his abdomen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sacred internals of Sir Wollobie!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He has them all. And they all make him ill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He is very lonely. He speaks of his wife. There is no Lady Wollobie, but a woman in a flat in Bayswater who cries in her sleep for more curricles.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He does not say this, but I understand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He derides the Council of the Indian Office. He imprecates the Government.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He curses the journals.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 64]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He has a clob. He curses that clob.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Females with teeth monstrous explain to him the theory of Government.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Men of long hair, the psychologues of the paint-pots, correct him tenderly, but from above.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He has known of the actualities of life—Death, Power, Responsibility, Honour—the Good accomplished, the effacement of Wrong for forty years.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There remains to him a seat in a penny \u0027bus.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If I do not take him from that.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I rap my heels on the knife-board. I sing \"tra la la.\" I am also well disposed to larmes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He courbes himself underneath an ulstaire and he damns the fog to eternity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He wills not that I leave him. He desires that I come to dinner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am grave. I think upon Lady Wollobie—shorn of chaprassies—at the Clob. Not in Bayswater.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I accept. He will bore me affreusely, but ... I have taken his seat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He descends from the tumbril of his humilia[Pg 65]tion, and the street hawker rolls a barrow up his waistcoat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then intervenes the fog—dense, impenetrable, hopeless, without end.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is because of the fog that there is a drop upon the end of my nose so chiselled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gentlemen the Governors, the Lieutenant-Governors and the Commissaires, behold the doom prepared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am descended to the gates of your Life in Death.
