However, the capital’s surroundings were pervaded with the flames of war, and it was no longer as prosperous or safe compared to its prior state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA huge light array, which resembled a flipped bowl, covered the entire capital. Meanwhile, the city walls were densely packed with soldiers armed with spears. Currently, their eyes were all filled with anxiety as they stared into the distance. At that area, there were countless individuals scattered across the mountain range, while battle cries sounded continuously. Meanwhile, there were numerous individuals standing in the sky above that area, and the powerful auras radiating from their bodies, created a pressure that exceeded that brought by the tens of thousands of soldiers below.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCountless people clenched their teeth while they held tightly onto their weapons. Meanwhile, hatred and anger filled their eyes. The capital was the last line of defence for the Great Yan Empire. Hence, if it was broken, their Great Yan Empire would be history. At that time, they would become individuals with no country, and would be forced to leave their homes to roam aimlessly. Moreover, this miserable fate was something that they, citizens of the Great Yan Empire, had witnessed far too many times over the past year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRight now, the entire capital was covered by the fog of war and the atmosphere was extremely tense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the same time, the atmosphere within a large hall in the capital was so tense that it had almost solidified.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere were many people in that large hall and a tall burly middle-aged man was seated in front.

He was Mo Ling, the person who joined the Hundred Empire War together with Lin Dong, and subsequently accompanied him to join Dao Sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEvidently, Mo Ling’s strength had surged after three years of training.

In fact, their strength had far exceeded the other three Great Clans and even the royal family. Furthermore, even the royal family did not dare to express the slightest bit of displeasure towards the growing Lin Clan. Of course, there was only one simple reason behind this. It was because of that one person from the Lin Clan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA clansman called Lin Dong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was because of him, that the Dao Sect repeatedly bestowed gifts upon the Lin Clan. In fact, even the Great Yan Empire benefited as its strength had grown and it even managed to shake off its status as a low rank empire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTherefore, everyone knew that even though the royal family was supposedly in charge of the Great Yan Empire, the words spoken by the Lin Clan were even more powerful than the royal family.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Brother Lin Fan, the enemy’s troops are currently pressing in on our border walls. What should we do?” Mo Jingtian looked towards the Lin Clan. At that spot, there were two figures seated side by side at the front. One of them was the head of the Lin Clan, Lin Fan, while the other was a white haired elderly man. Though the latter remained silent, no one dared to be disrespectful towards him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeanwhile, there was a middle-aged man behind the latter. He had a stern looking face, and his looks bore some resemblance to that of Lin Dong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat old man was Lin Zhentian, Lin Dong’s grandfather. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man seated behind him was Lin Xiao, Lin Dong’s father. At the same time, there was also a pretty woman beside him. She was Lin Dong’s mother, Liu Yan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThanks to their relationship with Lin Dong, their status within the Lin Clan was such that even the clan head Lin Fan, did not dare to offend them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Fan sighed softly upon hearing Mo Jingtian’s inquiry. Then, he shook his head bitterly. The Eastern Xuan Region was currently in chaos and even Dao Sect was barely able to protect themselves. Therefore, what could they possibly do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It is rumoured that some experts from the Yuan Gate are coming over. Once they arrive, I’m afraid…” Mo Jingtian laughed bitterly and said, “I wonder if the elders from Dao Sect…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis eyes shifted towards another spot as he spoke. There were over a dozen figures quietly seated there. One of them was a gray robed blind old man. This was also a familiar figure. In fact, he was the Dao Sect elder who was managing the Martial Arts Hall while Lin Dong was in Dao Sect. Back then, Lin Dong had received quite a lot of pointers from him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, this Dao Sect elder merely shook his head quietly at this moment. Meanwhile, he had a slightly gloomy expression.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEveryone in the hall could only sigh softly upon seeing this.

It is rumoured that he is completely different from before. If he returned, we might stand a chance.” Just as the crowd descended into silence, a delicate looking young lady behind the blind elder suddenly interrupted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis young lady joined Dao Sect after Lin Dong left. However, even though she had never met him before, this did not stop her from becoming a loyal fan of martial senior Lin Dong. After all, it was precisely because of him that she chose to join the Desolate Hall, even though she was qualified to join the Sky Hall.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis name, which seemingly had a magical ring to it, resounded through the hall, lifting the spirits of many individuals present.

Meanwhile, Liu Yan’s eyes began to turn red. After which, she leaned on Lin Xiao before a soft sobbing sound appeared.
