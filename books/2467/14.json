Detective Brunswick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.

Theories say confeshun is necess... ary. But if he\u0027s not... there, maybe I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Brunswick\u0027s voice picked up a distinct, let\u0027s-humor-the-crazy-person inflection. \"If you give me your name, I can tell him you called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaving herself more-or-less erect in the chair, Dr. Burke declared in ringing tones, \"I am the Director of... Life Sciencesh. He knows who I am. Everyone knows... who I am.\" Then she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much... for tha.\" She pulled Donald\u0027s jacket off the desk and onto her lap. \"I really feel... awful \u0027bout thish, Donald. I\u0027m gonna make it up... to you. You\u0027ll see.\" An idea somehow forced its way through a bottle and a half of single malt. \"You know, if the iso-lation box is running then the re-frigeration is running and you\u0027re prob-ly cold.\" With a desperate grip wrapped around the arm of her chair, she managed to get to her feet. \"If you\u0027re cold, you\u0027re gonna want your jacket.\" Finishing the mouthful of Scotch in the mug nearly knocked her over. She swayed, steadied, and started for the door. \"I\u0027m gonna take you your... jacket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, far behind the layers of insulation provided by the alcohol, a terrified voice shrieked, \"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Burke ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many electrical rooms can one lousy building have?\" Breathing heavily, Vicki backed out into the hall, trying to shine her flashlight in all directions at once. Her voice scraped across her teeth in a strained whisper. \"Every time we open a door, I expect to see my mother behind it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci reached out and closed one hand over her shoulder, the other catching her wrist and directing the beam of light away from his eyes. The last thing they needed was for both of them to be wandering around blind. \"Let me open the doors,\" he suggested quietly, turning her to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She shook her head. \"You don\u0027t understand. She\u0027s my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki... \" Then he sighed because there really wasn\u0027t anything he could say that would change things and if the thought of opening a door and finding Marjory Nelson staring at them out of a corpse\u0027s eyes had him scared spitless, God only knew what it was doing to Vicki. Donald Li had been bad enough, but Marjory Nelson was, as Dr. Burke had so kindly reminded them, up and walking. Up and walking and dead. But if Vicki had the guts to face it, he\u0027d face it beside her. Besides, as much as he might wish that Henry Fitzroy had never appeared on the scene, he couldn\u0027t abandon him to the kind of living death that Donald had been trapped in. \"Let\u0027s shut that power off, find Fitzroy, and get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, head barely moving, the motion more intent than actuality, and twisted out from under Celluci\u0027s hands. The shadows pressed against her, trying to undermine the precarious balance she maintained. We\u0027re going to find Henry. To do that, we\u0027re going to confine him to one floor. So we\u0027re going to shut the power off. Then we\u0027re going to tear this place apart, one floor at a time. We\u0027re going to find Henry. I will not fail him. Like I failed my mother. As long as she clung to that, she could function. Let the shadows push as they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air in the subbasement tasted of damp concrete and rust and disuse and the building itself, creaking, settling, hiding secrets, made more noise than both of them; although the sound of their breathing seemed to linger where they passed. The rooms to the right of the corridor were up against the outside wall and so every one of them had to be checked; the door opened, the light shone in, the potential horror realized. They\u0027d found two small electrical substations with panels labeled \"labs three\" \"labs four\" and \"lecture one\" but hadn\u0027t touched the breakers. \"All at once,\" Vicki had growled. \"So we don\u0027t warn her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne door remained before the corner; one door, one room and they\u0027d finished the north side of the building. Celluci checked his watch as they hurried toward it. 11:17? Is that all? They still had over half the night. Not so long, he amended as he realized it was probably all the time they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA square shadow of darker paint at eyelevel, metal dimpling all four corners, indicated a missing sign. A security bar resting loosely over a steel eye suggested that the room had once held something worth guarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This could be it.\" Jerking the bar free, Vicki hauled the heavy door open. Stiff hinges shrilled a clich¨¦d protest that scraped against the inside of her skull like nails on a blackboard. She gritted her teeth and scythed the flashlight beam across the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething moved just beyond the edge of the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze. The circle of illumination froze with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust past it, something moved again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll she had to do was direct the flashlight less than a meter to the left. All she had to do...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single, naked bulb hanging caged from the ceiling cut black silhouettes around a complex arrangement of pipes. About four feet off the ground, a humped brown body and naked tail disappeared down an impossibly narrow crevice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki remembered how to breathe. \"Rat,\" she said, because she had to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a mouse trying out for the Olympics,\" Celluci allowed, his hand still covering the light switch. He wet his lips and tried to push his heart down out of his throat. \"I\u0027m beginning to think that finding her would be better than the constant fear that we will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping at her streaming eyes, Vicki battled the knot in her stomach. You will not puke! she commanded herself, swallowing bile. After a moment, she lifted her head and muttered, \"I\u0027m beginning to think you\u0027re right.\" She jabbed her glasses back into place. \"This is obviously the sprinkler room. Not what we\u0027re looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the hall, she paused and said, before he could follow, \"Leave the light on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught up to her as she was about to check the first room on the west wall. Frowning, he squinted down the length of the corridor, attempting to isolate the sheen of polished metal that had caught his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki, there\u0027s a padlock on that door down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki turned. The cone of light stretching out from her hand didn\u0027t quite stretch far enough. Not only could she not see a lock, she only had Celluci\u0027s word for it that there was a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my experience,\" he continued, \"you lock rooms you don\u0027t want people to go into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or get out of,\" Vicki added. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the entrance to the room they\u0027d just left, this door retained its sign. Danger. High Voltage. Keep out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Odds are good this is the electrical room.\" Handing Celluci the flashlight, \"Here. Hold this. I\u0027m going to need both hands.\" Vicki rummaged her lockpicks out of her purse. \"Keep it steady.\" Dropping to one knee, she flicked open the case and drew out the two largest picks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were shaking so violently, she couldn\u0027t get either of them into the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer second attempt was no more successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third attempt, she dropped one of the probes. It bounced off her knee, chimed against the tile, and came to rest with the hooked end over the toe of Celluci\u0027s shoe. Vicki stared down at it. Then she scowled at the remaining pick, so tightly gripped that her fingertips had gone white behind the nails, spun suddenly, and flung it down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamnit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t stop her hands from shaking. There was no way she was going to be able to pick that lock. So much for finding the fucking electrical room. They were going to turn off the power. Prevent Henry from being moved from floor to floor. They were going to tear the building apart one floor at a time. They were going to find Henry. She had to hold onto that. It was all she had. Except that it\u0027s all falling apart! She wanted to beat her head against the door and scream with fear and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he\u0027d read her mind, Celluci reached out and cupped her chin, gently drawing her around to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot trusting herself to speak, she nodded and stood, holding out the remaining picks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not quite my style.\" Passing her back the flashlight, he added, \"Wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe disappeared before she could object and for one terrifying moment it seemed that the darkness had devoured him. By the time she\u0027d swung the light around, he\u0027d gone beyond its range. All at once, with a familiar squeal of metal, the far end of the hall leapt, if not into focus, at least into sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is he doing in the sprinkler room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, not bothering to close the door behind him, he came back around the corner, both hands holding...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... a length of pipe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved out of his way as he returned, jammed one end of the pipe down through the loop of the padlock and braced it against the metal covering the door. Taking a deep breath, he threw his weight against the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pipe bit into the door, metal buckling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace darkening, Celluci growled an inarticulate challenge, grateful for a place to finally throw all the terror-produced adrenaline of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security bar slowly bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike?... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBit by bit the screws dragged free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just. A little. Fur... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden surrender flung him backward as the entire assembly crashed to the floor. He staggered, nearly fell, and leaned panting on the pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stepped forward and retrieved her fallen lock-pick from under the mess. \"Obviously, your break-and-enter specialist was a little more direct than mine,\" she muttered dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci gulped for air. \"Obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaught by the sheer normalcy of the exchange, they stared at one another for a moment, then Vicki\u0027s mouth curved into almost a smile as she reached up and pushed the curl of hair back off his forehead. \"Well, then,\" she stretched the words out, feeling some of the desperation go with them, \"let\u0027s hear it for testosterone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci snorted, straightened, and let the pipe drop. \"Personally, I\u0027m amazed you didn\u0027t pull a package of plastique out of that suitcase you carry.\" Shoving the junked security bar out of the way, he pulled open the door and fumbled around the corner for the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d definitely found the electrical room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled for command of her voice. \"I see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bloodscent drew him out of the pit where exhaustion had flung him and threw the Hunger loose again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone, something, was banging on the inside of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry?\" Vicki called, one foot moving in front of the other through no conscious decision she could remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer, only the continued banging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t call for the other. In case there was an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki, let me... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. This is something I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is,\" Celluci growled, fighting the paralysis that the sight of the stainless steel box invoked and moving up behind her left shoulder. Goddammit, Vicki, why can\u0027t you turn and run? So I can turn and run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched her reflection grow larger as she approached. The closer she got, the more distance her mind insisted on until, not quite touching the box, she stopped, stared into her own eyes, and straightened her glasses feeling as though the whole experience had slid out of reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even watch horror movies, she told herself. What the hell am I doing starring in one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched her arm come up, her hand cover the latch, her fingers twist slightly sideways...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lid flew open, slapping her hand aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught a glimpse of a pale face under red-gold hair. Then, before she could react, something black and heavy swooped down upon her and she stumbled back, blind. Cold and clammy, it wrapped tightly around her head and draped over her shoulders with obscene familiarity. Her throat pumping out shrill sounds of incoherent terror, she tore at it in panicked frenzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, as terror began to pick up some of the shading of rage, she wrenched it loose and flung it to the floor. Her glasses, secured over only one ear, began to fall, and the greater fear their loss roused brought her back to sanity as she shoved them back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her feet lay a pile of black leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry\u0027s trench coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, as if recognition had thrown a switch, she became aware of snarling, cursing, and the impact of flesh on flesh. Looping the strap of her bag over her wrist, it was the only weapon she had, she whirled in time to see Celluci get a leg between his body and Henry\u0027s and use it to fling the smaller man across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaked to the waist, Henry\u0027s torso gleamed like alabaster, amethyst bruises marking the inside of both arms. He used the momentum of the blow to roll up onto his feet and, snarling, charged again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci grunted under the impact and slammed his elbow into the side of Henry\u0027s head, to no apparent effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce or twice over the last year, Vicki had been given a glimpse of what lay behind the mask of civilization Henry wore. Had, even while cold sweat beaded her skin and common sense screamed \"Run!\" been aroused by so much deadly power so lightly held in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had warned her once, \"The beast is much closer to the surface in my kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast was loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci had barely registered that the box was open when he found himself flat on his back and fighting for his life. He\u0027d hit the floor with Henry Fitzroy\u0027s hands around his throat and had only survived those first few seconds because one hand, swollen and nearly useless, had not been able to maintain its grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his left forearm shoved up under Fitzroy\u0027s chin and his right hand trying to rip the crushing fingers from his windpipe, Celluci had a sudden, unavoidable epiphany about vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d caught a glimpse of the reality last August when Mark Williams had died, but that had been easy to bury in the tangled mix of reaction that Henry evoked. Even through his jealousy, he\u0027d recognized and responded to Fitzroy\u0027s personal power. Respect had been inevitable when stopping Anwar Tawfik had thrown them together. Other emotions, less easily defined, had been, for the most part, ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it all distilled down to survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s stronger. Faster. The frenzy of the attack gave him an opening. Hooking his foot into the top of Fitzroy\u0027s pelvis, Celluci heaved the smaller man across the room. Less than a heartbeat later, the vampire charged him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNails gouged into his cheek. He knew the skin had been broken by the intensity of Fitzroy\u0027s response. Frantically twisting his head to one side, he heard teeth snap beside his ear. I never noticed his fucking teeth were so god-damned long!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m meat to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a dead man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t something they did to him. He\u0027s after the blood! Emotional response insisted she throw herself into the battle, ripping Henry off Celluci\u0027s throat. A more visceral reaction suggested she run for her life. She stomped down hard on both and stood trembling where she was. Goddamnit, Vicki, think! Remember what he\u0027s told you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d talked about his desire to feed like it was a force separate from the rest of him, a force over which he had to exert a certain amount of conscious control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. He\u0027s lost control. He\u0027s hungry. It wasn\u0027t a difficult deduction; his need was a tangible presence, beating against the walls of the small room. Those bastards have probably been drawing blood for tests all day. Blood\u0027s all Henry has. He has to replace it. He\u0027ll rip Mike\u0027s throat out to get to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I give him an easier source. One he doesn\u0027t have to fight for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping to her knees, Vicki upended her purse, searching for her knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Celluci was a large man in excellent physical condition, speed and strength enhanced by the certain knowledge that if he lost, he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately for him, Henry Fitzroy had been not only weakened by blood loss but also exhausted and injured by the Hunger\u0027s fight to get free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich only delayed the inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBleeding from half a dozen small wounds, breath burning in his throat, joints popping as Fitzroy\u0027s teeth slowly descended in spite of everything, Celluci knew with cold certainty that he was losing. And there wasn\u0027t a damned thing he could do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood trickling down into her hand, Vicki dove across the room, buried her fingers in Henry\u0027s hair and yanked his head up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci felt lips peel back against his skin and the lightest kiss of pain. Then the heated contact jerked away and teeth sheared the air in the hollow between jaw and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki straddled both men and yanked again, harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowling, Henry reared back onto his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the grip on his hair she would have lost her balance, but she managed to bring her arm around, blood soaking her cuff and dripping to the floor, and shove the wound against his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried out as his teeth cut deeper into flesh and the fingers of his good hand clutched almost to the bone. Then she cried out again as he began to suck, mouth working desperately at her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaguely aware of Celluci scrambling clear, she half slid down Henry\u0027s body until she knelt behind him, free hand moving from his hair to his shoulder. Eyes closed, she could feel the blood leave her body for his, feel his urgency catch her up and sweep her along, feel herself begin to be lost in his Hunger. He\u0027d been a passive recipient the last time she\u0027d forced her blood on him. While his need might be no greater now, it was far from passive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had a reality that burned, that consumed the memories of all the other times Henry had fed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes snapped open as, snarling with frustration, he thrust her wrist aside and whirled to face her. She rocked back. He followed, lips and teeth stained crimson, eyes compelling her to offer her throat, to submit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt her chin begin to rise and forced it back down. \"Fuck that!\" The hoarse whisper traveled just far enough. \"You feed where I allow.\" She brought her left hand up between them, trailing scarlet streamers in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t enough. The blood came too slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe batted the wound aside, laid his teeth against the soft flesh of the throat, and breathed in the rich scent of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew this life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Hunger roared forward, out of control, and his teeth pierced skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blow struck him hard in the side. He lost his hold, twisted as he fell and landed on his back, staring up at a dark-haired male who dared to take him from his prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blow. He grabbed at the leg and heaved it away, surging back onto his knees as part of the same motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki winced as Celluci hit the wall but kept her eyes locked on Henry. Just for a second, she\u0027d felt the Hunger falter. She could reach him. She had to reach him. It was the only chance for all three of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight hand clamped tourniquet tight above the wound, from the pain involved she suspected his teeth had torn a hole significantly larger than her initial incision, she again offered her left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to dive at her, checked, and slowly raised his eyes up from the welling blood to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunger bucked and writhed, but he held it tight, pulling strength from the blood he\u0027d already taken. Pulling strength from her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry. Yes. A name to leash the Hunger with. He forced his lips to form a name to help recage it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned as he swayed, and shuffled toward him, still on her knees. \"Henry, you\u0027ve got to keep feeding. You haven\u0027t taken nearly as much as you need. Besides... \" She glanced down at her wrist and looked quickly away again. \"Besides,\" she repeated, \"we\u0027re just wasting it on the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry moaned and crumpled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki caught him, smearing his back with blood. Holding him awkwardly, she dragged her legs out from under, and gathered him onto her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... \" He pushed her wrist away as she laid it against his mouth. The brief taste of her nearly catapulted the Hunger to freedom. The bloodscent alone tore at hastily erected barricades. \"I don\u0027t trust... myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid her wrist against his mouth again, blood dribbling down over lips clamped shut and staining his cheeks. That he was too weak to stop her merely proved her point. \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake, Henry, stop being a martyr. I trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt him hesitate, then she felt his lips part. The torn flesh wrapped barbed lines of pain around her arm as he pressed against her and began to suckle. Muscles tensed, but she managed not to pull away and slowly the familiar rhythm pushed the pain to one side, her body responding with something very like post-coital lassitude. Resting her cheek against the top of Henry\u0027s head, she sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that nice,\" Celluci grunted, glaring down at the tableau and wiping at the blood on his face. \"Love conquers all.\" Sucking his breath through his teeth, he squatted beside them and peered into what he could see of Vicki\u0027s face. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaught in the incessant pull of Henry\u0027s need, she didn\u0027t bother to raise her head, wouldn\u0027t have even bothered to answer except that the concern in his voice demanded a response. \"I\u0027m fine.\" And then, because she belatedly realized Celluci deserved more than that, added, \"I think I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" He shifted position. Somehow, this was more intimate than watching them make love. He barely resisted the urge to grab Henry and violently stuff him back into the isolation box. \"How do you know when he\u0027s had enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll know. He\u0027ll stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? What if he needs more than you can spare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki sighed again, but this time the exhalation had an entirely different sound. \"He won\u0027t take more than I can spare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci reached up for the open lip of the box and hauled himself to his feet. \"You\u0027ll excuse me if I don\u0027t put a lot of faith in that. A few minutes ago he was ready to kill both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was then... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this is now? Very deep, Vicki. Very deep bullshit. He stops in fifteen seconds or I\u0027m yanking him off the tit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be no need, Detective.\" The statement, although barely audible, left no room for argument. Henry, having pulled away just enough for speech, molded his mouth back over the wound, pressing the edges of the torn flesh together in order for the coagulant in his saliva to work. He could feel Vicki\u0027s life wrapped around his own and, while the last thing he wanted right at this moment was to break free of it, continuing to feed would only endanger them both. She would die from loss of blood and he would die from loss of her. He had taken all he was going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the second time she had saved him. The first time, she hadn\u0027t known the risks and, defeated by the demon, the Hunger had lain in darkness with him beyond the need for control. This time, she knew what she was offering and offered in spite of the Hunger raging free. I wanted to hear her say I love you. I just heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what had he given in return?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Vicki.\" He rested his head against her breast, conserving the little strength he\u0027d regained. \"I can stop most of the bleeding, but I can\u0027t repair the damage. You\u0027re going to need a dressing of some kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki glanced down at her wrist and her stomach twisted. \"Jesus H. Christ.\" She swallowed bile. \"It looks like it should hurt a lot more than it does.\" Then suddenly, it did. \"Oh, damn... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci grabbed Henry\u0027s shirt out of the box and dropped to his knees. \"I think Jesus H. Christ about sums it up. Fuck, Fitzroy, you\u0027re a god-damned animal!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry met the detective\u0027s stormy glare with a calm gaze of his own. \"Not when I can help it,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Well.\" Celluci looked away first, burying his confusion. He almost kills both of us. He chews a big fucking hole in Vicki. And I feel sorry for him? in the wrapping of Vicki\u0027s arm. \"You\u0027re lucky,\" he grunted as he began to bind Henry\u0027s shirt around the wound. \"It\u0027s messy, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any tendon damage. Move your fingers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move them anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering profanities under her breath, Vicki did as instructed, all three of them anxiously watching the digits perform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I tell you.\" Relief made Celluci\u0027s own fingers tremble as he tied off the thick bandage and held a sleeve up in each hand. \"We\u0027ll use these as a sling, to immobilize it, but you\u0027re going to Emergency as soon as we get out of here.\" Vicki bowed her head as he knotted the cuffs at the back of her neck and he rested his cheek for a moment against her hair, much as she\u0027d done earlier with Henry, who still reclined against the support of her good arm. \"I thought... \" He\u0027d thought she was going to die when he\u0027d kicked the teeth away from her throat. He\u0027d thought she was suicidal when she\u0027d presented herself again. And when it had actually worked, he\u0027d thought... he\u0027d thought... He didn\u0027t know what he thought anymore. \"I thought it was all over,\" he finished lamely and sat back on his heels. And if she asks me what I meant by all, I don\u0027t know what to tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his eyes widened, and he snickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry looked startled and pulled himself up into a shaky but nearly erect sitting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s brows snapped down. \"What the hell are you laughing at?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci waved a hand at the two of them and snickered again. \"Just for a minute there I was reminded of Michelangelo\u0027s Pieta. You know, the statue of the Madonna holding the body of Christ across her lap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think me an inappropriate Christ?\" Henry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci took a good long look at the other man, at the bruising, at the horror that still lurked around hazel eyes, at the mixture of physical youth and spiritual age, at the nearly visible sense of self now firmly back in place, and shook his head. \"Actually,\" he said, \"as Christs go, I\u0027ve seen worse. But the Madonna... \" The snicker returned at Vicki\u0027s indignant stare. \"But the Madonna has definitely been miscast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s lips twitched. \"You rotten bastard,\" she began. Then she lost it and howled with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich pushed Celluci over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry hesitated, nerves scraped raw and unsure if he should be finding insult when Vicki didn\u0027t or blasphemy where none was intended, although honesty forced him to admit that Celluci had a valid point. Unable to withstand the purge of emotion, he joined in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf some of the laughter had a slightly hysterical tone, they all agreed to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Fergusson! What are you doing back here, man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgot something.\" Detective Fergusson picked a long narrow paper bag up off his desk and pulled a bottle of bubble bath shaped like a ninja turtle out far enough for the other man to identify it. \"My daughter sent me back for it. Informed me on her way to bed that broken promises make blisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is she now, four? Five?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Brunswick shook his head. \"Five years old and she\u0027s already got you asking how high on the way up. Man, when she becomes a teenager, she\u0027s going to run you ragged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFergusson snorted, cramming bag and bottle into his coat pocket. \"By that time maybe her mother\u0027ll be slowing down.\" He leaned over and squinted at the piece of pink message paper topping a stack of reports like a square of icing. \"What the hell\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just some drunk calling you to confess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confess to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sinking of the Lusitania? The shooting of JFK? Repatriating the constitution? I don\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t want to confess to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez, why do I always get them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrunswick grinned and snapped his gun. \"Because you\u0027re such a sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, too,\" Fergusson muttered absently, reading the actual message. \"Director of Life Sciences?... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seemed to think I should know who she was. In fact, she told me that everyone knew who she was.\" He watched the other man\u0027s face for a moment and his grin faded. \"You don\u0027t think there\u0027s actually anything in this, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" He crumpled the paper and stuffed it in the pocket with his daughter\u0027s bubble bath, his expression resembling that of a hound worrying at a bone. \"Maybe.\" Then he shrugged and sighed. \"Maybe not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t even begun to convince me that we shouldn\u0027t haul ass out of here right now,\" Celluci growled. \"You,\" he jabbed a finger at Henry, \"are operating on half a tank. And you,\" the finger moved to wave in front of Vicki\u0027s nose, \"are about three pints short.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that much,\" Vicki protested, although from the way she felt, she wasn\u0027t going to bet on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci ignored her. \"We all look like we\u0027ve been through the wars. Let\u0027s just clear out of here and leave the mopping up to the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t Mike me. And I want that wrist of yours looked at by a doctor before you get gangrene in it and have to have your fucking hand chopped off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wound won\u0027t infect,\" Henry said with quiet assurance. \"And I am going to the lab.\" He stretched out both arms. Although the bruising had faded from purple to green and the broken bones in his hand had begun to knit, the marks of needles were still very evident. \"If, as you say, Catherine didn\u0027t move me until late afternoon, any samples, any test results, will be there. They have to be destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, Fitzroy,\" Celluci sighed. \"No one\u0027s going to believe anything these people say after their attempt to play Dr. Frankenstein has been discovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t risk that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci looked from Henry to Vicki and back again, then he savagely shoved both hands up through his hair. \"Jesus, there\u0027s nothing to choose between you. All right, all right, we\u0027ll go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I was going,\" Henry pointed out. \"You don\u0027t have to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck that,\" Celluci told him bluntly. \"We went through too much to find you. You\u0027re not moving out of our sight until we stuff you back in that god-damned closet come morning. Unless?... \" He raised an eloquent brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry half smiled. \"You\u0027re both perfectly safe. Although I still hunger, Vicki\u0027s blood was more than enough to return my control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci\u0027s hand rose involuntarily to the place on his throat that Henry\u0027s teeth had grazed. Angrily, he turned the motion into an abrupt gesture at the wall of wiring and electrical panels. \"We still shutting off the power?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded and instantly regretted the motion as her head seemed to want to keep on falling. \"The reasons for doing it haven\u0027t changed. If there\u0027re any more of those... experiments in this building, I want them shut down.\" She paused and swallowed, hard. Dr. Burke had said her mother was up and walking around. It wouldn\u0027t be so easy to turn her mother off; to see that her mother died a second time. \"We should have about forty-five minutes on the emergency lighting, not that it\u0027ll make any difference to me. Plenty of time to get to the lab, do what we have to, and get out. Then the police can handle the rest.\" She caught Celluci\u0027s gaze and held it. \"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" He moved toward the corner of the room where a thick plastic pipe came through the wall and disappeared into a metal box about two feet square. \"This is the main feed, so this must be the main disconnect box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose behind him, Vicki peered over his shoulder. \"How do you know? I thought your father was a plumber?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a guy thing, you wouldn\u0027t under... Ow! Damn it, Vicki, that was the last bit of unbruised flesh I had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had,\" Vicki repeated, flicking on her flashlight. \"Just pull the switch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe switch, about a foot long and rust-pitted down its entire length, refused to surrender so easily. \"This thing,\" Celluci grunted, throwing his weight on it, \"hasn\u0027t been moved since they wired the building.\" He managed to force it down to a forty-five-degree angle but could budge it no farther. \"I need something to lever it with. The pipe we used on the door... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I?\" Henry reached past Celluci, wrapped long pale fingers around the switch, and slammed it down in one, fluid motion, snapping it off at the base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light in the electrical room went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you hadn\u0027t regained all your strength.\" Celluci squinted in the circle of illumination thrown by Vicki\u0027s flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry, who\u0027d stepped back to shield sensitive eyes, shrugged, forgetting for the moment that he couldn\u0027t be seen. \"I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ. How strong are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResisting the urge to brag, to further advance himself over a rival who had somehow become much more, Henry settled for a diplomatic, \"Not strong enough to get free on my own.\" Which was, after all, only the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine frowned down into the microscope. There had to be a way to use the regenerative properties of the vampire\u0027s cells to extend the limited life of her bacteria. Once found, she could tailor new bacteria for number nine and keep him from decomposing like all the rest. She looked up and shot a smile across the room to where he sat patiently watching her from the edge of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, the lights went out and the constant hum of her computer was swallowed by the silence that swept in with the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s her!\" Catherine gripped the table tightly with both hands until the world steadied. \"She\u0027s done this. She wants you to die.\" Knocking over her stool, she stood and stumbled to the door, arms stretched stiffly out before her. A moment\u0027s fumbling with the lock and she stepped out into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt each bend of the corridor, battery-operated emergency lights provided enough illumination for movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has gone far enough. We have to get to the lab. Come on,\" she called back over her shoulder. \"We\u0027ll stop her together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber nine could just barely see her outlined in the doorway.
