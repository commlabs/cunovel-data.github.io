He eyed the young freelance journalist from the National Geographic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn open laptop computer resting on his knees, Norman Fields sat beside Sam and stared out across the jungle-shrouded ruins. A smear of mud ran from the man’s cheek to his neck. Though he wore an Australian bushwacker and matching leather hat, Norman failed to look the part of the rugged adventure photojournalist. He wore thick glasses with lenses that slightly magnified his eyes, making him look perpetually surprised, and though he stood a little over six feet, he was as thin as a pole, all bones and lanky limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam rolled up to one elbow on his mat of woven reed. “Sorry, what was that, Norm?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The afternoon is so quiet,” his companion whispered, his Boston accent flavoring his words. Norman closed his eyes and breathed deeply. “You can practically hear the ancient voices echoing off the mountains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam carefully laid the tiny paintbrush beside the small stone relic he had been cleaning and sat up. He tapped his muddied cowboy hat back farther on his head and wiped his hands on his Wranglers. Again, like so many times before, after working for hours upon a single stone of the ruins, the overall beauty of the ancient Incan city struck him like a draught of cold beer on a hot Texas afternoon. It was so easy to get lost in the fine ministrations of brush on stone and lose sight of the enormity and breadth of the whole. Sam pushed into a seated position to better appreciate the somber majesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly missed his cutting horse, a painted Appaloosa still back on his uncle’s dusty ranch outside Muleshoe, Texas. He itched to ride among the ruins and follow its twisted paths to the mystery of the thick jungle beyond the city. He sat there with the ghost of a smile on his face, soaking up the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is something mystical about this place,” Norman continued, leaning back upon his hands. “The towering peaks. The streams of mist. The verdant jungle. The very air smells of life, as if some substance in the wind encourages a vitality in the spirit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam patted the journalist’s arm in good-natured agreement. The view was a wondrous sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilt in a high saddle between two Andean peaks, the newly discovered jungle city spread in terraced plazas across half a square mile. A hundred steps connected the various stonework levels. From Sam’s vantage point among the remains of the SunPlaza, he could survey the entire pre-Columbian ruin below him: from the homes of the lower city outlined in lines of crumbling stone, to the Stairway of the Clouds that led to SunPlaza on which they perched. Here, like its sister city Machu Picchu, the Incas had displayed all their mastery of architecture, merging form and function to carve a fortress city among the clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, unlike the much-explored Machu Picchu, these ruins were still raw. Discovered by his uncle Hank only a few months back, much still lay hidden under vine and trees. A spark of pride flared with the memory of the discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Hank had pinpointed its location from old tales passed among the Quechans of the region. Using hand-scrawled maps and pieces of tales, he had led a team out from Machu Picchu along the UrabambaRiver, and in only ten days, discovered the ruins below MountArapa. The discovery had been covered in all the professional journals and popular magazines. Nicknamed the Cloud Ruins, his uncle’s picture beamed from many a front page. And he deserved it—it had been a miraculous demonstration of extrapolation and archaeological skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this sentiment might be clouded by Sam’s feelings for his uncle. Hank had raised Sam since his parents had died in a car crash when he was nine years old. Henry’s own wife had died of cancer the same year, about four months earlier. Drawn together in grief, they developed a deep bond. The two had become nearly inseparable. So it was to no one’s surprise that Sam pursued a career in archaeology at Texas A\u0026amp;M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d swear if you listen close enough,” Norman said, “you can even hear the wail of the warriors calling from high in the peaks, the whispers of hawkers and buyers from the lower city, the songs of the laborers in the terraced fields beyond the walls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam tried to listen, but all he could hear were the occasional snatches of raised voices and the rasping of shovel and pick echoing up from a nearby hole. The noises were not the voices of the Incan dead, but of the workers and his fellow students laboring deep in the heart of the ruins. The gaping hole led to a shaft that dropped thirty feet straight down, ending in a honeycomb of excavated rooms and halls, a subterranean structure of several levels. Sam sat up straighter. “You ought to be a poet, Norman, not a journalist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman sighed. “Just try listening with your heart, Sam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thickened his west Texas drawl, knowing how it irritated Norman, who hailed from Boston. “Right now all I kin hear with is my belly. And it ain’t saying nothing but complaining about dinnertime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman scowled at him. “You Texans have no poetry in your souls. Just iron and dust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And beer. Don’t forget the beer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laptop computer suddenly chimed the six o’clock hour, drawing their attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rattling groan escaped the narrow confines of Sam’s throat. “We’d better wrap up the site before the sun sets. By nightfall, the place will be crawling with looters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman nodded and twisted around to gather his camera packs. “Speaking of grave robbers, I heard gunfire last night,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam frowned while storing away his brushes and dental picks. “Guillermo had to scare off a band of huaqueros. They were trying to tunnel into our ruins. If Gil hadn’t found them, they might have pierced the dig and destroyed months of work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s good your uncle thought to hire security.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam nodded, but he heard the trace of distaste in Norman’s voice at the mention of Guillermo Sala, the ex-policeman from Cuzco assigned as the security head for the expedition. Sam shared the journalist’s sentiment. Black-haired and black-eyed, Gil bore scars that Sam suspected weren’t all from the line of duty. Sam also noticed the sidelong glances he shared with his compadres when Maggie passed. The quick snippets of Spanish exchanged with guttural laughs heated Sam’s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was anyone hurt in the gunfire?” Norman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, just warning shots to scare off the thieves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman continued stuffing his gear. “Do you really think we’ll find some tomb overflowing with riches?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam smiled. “And discover the Tutankhmen of the New World? No, I don’t think so. It’s the dream of gold that draws the thieves, but not my uncle. Knowledge is what lured him here—and the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what is he is so doggedly searching for? I know he seeks some proof that another tribe existed before the Incas, but why this stubborn need for secrecy. I need to report to the Geographic at some point to update them before the next deadline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam bunched his brows. He had no answer for Norman. The same questions had been echoing in his own mind. Uncle Hank was keeping some snippet of information close to his chest. But this was always like the professor. He was open in all other ways, but when it came to professional matters, he could be extremely tight-lipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Sam finally said. “But I trust the professor. If he has his nose into something, we’ll just have to wait him out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shout suddenly arose from the excavated hole on the neighboring terrace: “Sam! Come look!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph Isaacson’s helmeted head popped from the shaft, excitement bright in his eyes. The large African-American, a fellow grad student, hailed from the University of Alabama. Financed on a football scholarship, he had excelled in his undergraduate years and managed to garner an academic scholarship to complete his masters in archaeology. He was as sharp as he was muscular. “You have to see this!” The carbide lamp of Ralph’s mining helmet flashed toward them. “We’ve reached a sealed door with writing on it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the door intact?” Sam called back, getting to his feet excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! And Maggie says there’s no evidence of tampering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be the breakthrough all of them had been searching for these past months. An intact tomb or royal chamber within the ancient ruins. Sam helped Norman, burdened by his sling of cameras, up the steep steps toward the highest terrace of the SunPlaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think—?” Norman huffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam held up a hand. “It may just be a basement level to one of the Incan temples. Let’s not get our hopes up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they had reached the excavated terrace, Norman was wheezing. Ralph frowned in disdain at the photographer’s exertion. “Havin’ trouble there, Norman? I could ask Maggie to help carry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photographer rolled his eyes and refrained from commenting, too winded to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam joined them atop the plaza. He was breathing hard, too. Any exertion at this high altitude taxed lungs and heart. “Leave him alone, Ralph,” he scolded. “Show us what you found.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph shook his head and led the way with his helmet lamp. The black man’s wide frame filled the three-foot-wide shaft as he mounted the ladder. Unlike Sam, Ralph did not get along with Norman. Ever since the photographer had let his sexual orientation be known, a certain friction had grown between the two. Raised in the Bible Belt, Ralph seemed unable to let go of certain prejudices that had nothing to do with color. But Henry had insisted they all work together. Be a team. So the two had developed a grumbling cooperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jackass,” Norman mumbled under his breath, shifting his camera load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam clapped the photographer on the shoulder and glanced into the excavated hole. The rungs of the ladder descended thirty feet to the warren of chambers and hallways below. “Don’t let him get to you,” Sam said. He waved toward the ladder. “Go on. I’ll follow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they descended, Ralph spoke, his words growing in excitement again. “We just got the carbon-dating back on the deepest level this morning. Did you hear, Sam? A.D. 1100. Predating the damn Incas by two damn centuries.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-4.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
