He’d insisted it was too early and she should get some of the sleep that he’d robbed her of. She hadn’t gotten any of that sleep—she’d jumped in the shower as soon as they’d kissed good-bye at her front door—but she’d loved him for saying so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank into her desk chair and barely managed to avoid spilling her coffee as that thought sank in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoved him? Wait, no, that’s not what she’d meant. She couldn’t feel that way about him. That way was surely headed for heartbreak with a guy like Drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he clearly cared about her, right? He jumped on a plane to come see her for less than twelve hours; he had to feel something for her. Or was she just trying to believe he felt something for her because, despite what she was trying to tell herself, she felt something for him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it, this wasn’t what was supposed to happen. This thing was supposed to be easy and fun and light. Maybe she could ignore these feelings and hope they went away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould she try to talk to Drew about how she felt? She shook her head. The only time she’d tried to talk about their relationship to Drew it had been an unmitigated disaster. She didn’t want to go through that again. Plus, she’d almost certainly scared him away after all of that race talk the night before. White men hated it when you reminded them of their privilege, she knew that all too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was she supposed to do with all of these feelings now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBury them in a corner, drink her damn coffee, and stop having major life crises at eight a.m., that’s what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to distract herself with work for most of the day, but by five thirty she gave up and called Maddie. She knew Maddie would tell her what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew walked into the hospital straight from the airport, thankful he’d had an extra shirt in his gym bag so he didn’t have to stop at home. Now that he was away from Alexa, he felt stupid about dropping everything to go see her, even though it had felt great in the moment. Good God, he was an adult, he’d been a doctor for four years, and yet he got bad news about one of his patients and flew five hundred miles just to hug one woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was getting in too deep. It was going to hurt way too much when it ended. It was going to hurt even more when she hated him. Like Molly had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never should have flown up there. The whole thing . . . it had been too much. Too intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of him wanted to flee, never answer her text messages again, never see her again, forget he’d ever known her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the thought of never seeing Alexa again made his stomach clench. He’d only left her this morning, and he still couldn’t wait to see her this weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the first person he saw when he stepped off the elevator was Carlos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, man, you look like shit,” was Carlos’s friendly greeting. He paused and his smile fell. “Oh wait. I heard about Jack. That sucks. I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew shrugged. What was he supposed to say? That’s okay? It wasn’t, really, and Carlos knew that. So he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were you last night?” Carlos followed him into his office. “I called you, but your phone was off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about lying, but he knew Carlos would find out eventually. He was like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went up to Berkeley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stopped halfway into the chair. Damn it, he should have lied; he knew Carlos would make this into a bigger deal than it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Hard day, you needed a hug from your girl?” He settled into the chair and looked up at Drew with a smug expression. Drew was too tired and irritable for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever, that wasn’t it.” He shrugged and smirked. “I just needed some stress relief that I couldn’t get from basketball. You know how it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos laughed, and for a minute, Drew thought Carlos would let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s how you’re going to play it? It was just a booty call, right? Give me a break, you like this girl. You flew to the other end of the state to see her! Don’t get me wrong—she’s great, and I approve completely, but . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew cut him off before he went too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I knew you’d do this. Calm down. It was just an hour flight. I’ve driven to the Valley to get laid before, same difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos rolled his eyes. Why was he friends with this guy again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First of all, no, you haven’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, fine, he was right. Not that Drew was going to let him know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Second, there’s nothing wrong with going to hang out with your girl when you’re upset. I’m glad she was there for you, man.” Carlos took a sip of his coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not how it was.” That was exactly how it was. “I don’t know why you keep acting like this thing with Alexa is some big deal, anyway. It’s probably not going to last all that much longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why wouldn’t it? What did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew resisted the urge to flip him off, but only because a nurse walked by his open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t do anything! It’s just . . . it’s been going on for a while; we’ve had a good run. Better to end things while they’re still good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos’s phone buzzed and he glanced at it, then back up at Drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No offense, man, but don’t be such a fucking idiot. I’ve seen the way you look at this girl. I’ve never seen you look at anyone or anything like you look at her. And you’re just going to throw all of that away for some bullshit reason? Because you’re too scared for something real?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos checked his phone again and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gotta go. But dude, stop being the idiot you always have been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie was borrowing her car for the weekend, so she drove Alexa to the airport on Friday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’re you feeling?” Maddie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she even describe how she felt about seeing Drew this weekend? Excited to see him, on edge about what the weekend could bring, relaxed at just the thought of being around him . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nervous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to talk to him. She had to know what was going on and how he felt before it was too late. Though she was afraid that ship had sailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a lot easier when I wasn’t overthinking this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie turned to her at the stoplight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t we both know that that could only last a weekend with you? Maybe a long weekend, maximum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want a pep talk, or do you want to talk about something else?” Maddie asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought for a second. A pep talk would just hype her up too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something else, please. Tell me about what’s-her-name, your crazy new client.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God, Alexa. Did I tell you what she wanted the other day? She needed cute exercise clothes, because she always runs into people she knows at the gym, right? But instead of Lululemon, she wanted exercise clothes that no one else has, so I had to dive into the world of $500 yoga pants and $200 sports bras, and let me tell you, that is a crazy world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gossiped the rest of the way to the airport, and Maddie hugged her when she got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck this weekend, Lex. Thanks for letting me use your car, and have a great trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged Maddie back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anytime, Mads, you know that. And thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew left straight from the hospital to pick Alexa up at the airport. Carlos high-fived him as he walked down the hall toward the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be at Heather’s 4th of July party on Sunday, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew nodded as he got in the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexa walked out of the terminal just as he drove up, and he jumped out of the car to kiss her. Okay, maybe he was being hasty about ending things. Maybe Carlos was right. He’d just been overtired and still upset about Jack on Wednesday morning. They could keep this going a little longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed her hand as he got on the freeway toward his house. Did she look tense? She looked tense. Should he ask why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hungry?” That was an easier question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged off her cardigan. She was still in business mode, wearing one of those conservative dresses that he secretly loved. “Starving. I barely had time for lunch, and I’ve depleted all of my office snacks this week.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-date/page-42.html","bookId":1776,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:47 AM"}
