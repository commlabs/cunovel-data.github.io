I\u0027m supposed to look pleasantly surprised at the discounted price and from there, I move the cart off screen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did my best to look impressed. \"Congratulations!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The production company is taping it a week from Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fabulous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I do well, I might get a speaking role next. No guarantees, of course. The man who produces the radio ads I do recommended me for this. Is that fantastic or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" I told her. She\u0027d explained to me that working in television was high on her list of career goals. And, of course, she had more of those than most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard from the TV people this morning that I got the job. Then I did a radio spot for a landscaping service. Oh, and I should be completely finished the mural by the end of the week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounced from one subject to the next with hardly a breath in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d been standing on the walkway leading to her porch, so she hadn\u0027t noticed the pink bicycle attached to my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you something,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Her eyes grew huge with curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my hands down the length of her arms, my gaze never leaving her face. I wanted to see her reaction when she first caught sight of the bicycle. \"Look behind me. At the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"You brought me a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I laughed. \"The bicycle at the back of my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face exploded with reaction. She covered her mouth with her fingers, then raced to my car. \"Oh, Michael, pink! I love pink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI helped her remove it from the carrier and let her examine all the features. She laughed at the tassels and the white basket I\u0027d had attached to the front. White with pink flowers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always wanted a pink bicycle,\" she told me breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? I love it! I absolutely love it. Thank you, oh, thank you so much.\" Once again her arms were around me--not that I was complaining. Her spontaneous joy filled me with joy, too. I was still unaccustomed to emotion like this. It burned in my chest the same way as tears did, and now I understood why people sometimes cry out of happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Macy had studied every inch of the bicycle, I handed it to her. She immediately hopped on and started pedaling down the empty sidewalk. She wore a skirt and her slim legs pumped the lime-green pedals as her laughter echoed along the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment he saw her, Sammy jumped down from Harvey\u0027s porch to chase after her, barking wildly. She braked and got off, pausing to crouch and rub Sammy\u0027s ears. Then she walked the bicycle back to me. She kept her gaze on the ground and I felt a stab of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael,\" she whispered, close to tears. \"Thank you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t cry, please.\" I shook my head. \"I just wanted to give you something special, and your bicycle was ruined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears spilled from her eyes. I\u0027d never seen Macy cry before, and I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. Or do. I felt completely helpless. \"Macy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so afraid of what\u0027ll happen if I fall in love with you. But I...think it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is loving me so bad?\" I asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no! It\u0027s just that you\u0027re an important doctor and, well, look at me,\" she said, gesturing at her white-andpurple saddle shoes with their pom-pom laces. \"You\u0027re dignified and I\u0027m...me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m falling in love with funny, undignified you and that\u0027s a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought one hand to her mouth and hid a sob. \"That\u0027ll change, though. Men think I\u0027m fun and different, and then they get to know me and after a while they decide I\u0027m...annoying. Or silly. And I couldn\u0027t stand it if that happened with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clasped her shoulders. \"Nothing\u0027s going to change my mind about you, Macy. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I said and took the bike from her. I leaned it against the fence and we sat together on the top step of her porch. Sammy lay at my feet with his chin on my shoe. I stroked his thick fur and he groaned softly, a sound that expressed contentment. A dog or cat asked for so little, I thought--food, shelter, affection--and gave so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile Macy continued to sniffle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to tell you something,\" I finally said. I\u0027d decided it was time Macy knew about Hannah\u0027s list, so I told her how I\u0027d come to make that phone call all those weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened intently as I described what Hannah had written. Her eyes revealed astonishment when I explained that Hannah had given me her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" she said, her hand pressed to her heart. \"She gave you my name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you. In the beginning I was sure she\u0027d made a mistake--or was playing a trick on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy laughed. \"Either one might be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s no mistake, no trick. Hannah was right about everything. You have taught me to laugh again, to enjoy life. When I\u0027m with you I feel happy I\u0027m alive. You are so generous and kind. You make me want to be a better person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Michael... I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s ever said anything lovelier to me in my whole life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to make an effort to keep from hugging her and kissing her again. I was afraid that once we started we wouldn\u0027t be able to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy rested her forehead against my shoulder. \"Hannah was one of the wisest, most generous women I\u0027ve ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Hannah had understood that I\u0027d need encouragement to move into the next stage of my life. She\u0027d released me to love again, but she\u0027d gone a step further. I felt a fresh sense of appreciation that Hannah had steered me toward Macy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s an awards banquet a week from Friday,\" I told her. \"I\u0027m nominated for Pediatrician of the Year, and I\u0027d like it very much if you\u0027d come with me.\" I\u0027d dreaded this evening until I\u0027d asked Macy to join me. It would mean everything to share this night with her, to have her at my side, win or lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a formal dinner?\" she asked. She seemed more than a little nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t embarrass you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, laughing at the thought. Macy was Macy. If she chose to show up in a pink taffeta gown and ballet slippers, that would be fine with me. If she wore a clown suit that wouldn\u0027t bother me, either, as long as she was by my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Michael, I can\u0027t believe this is happening. You\u0027re truly falling in love with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Macy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer look was serious now, if a bit fearful. \"I fell in love with you the night you stayed here after the accident. Any man who\u0027d put up with me, the cats and Harvey is a prince in my book. My prince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. \"This is the perfect house for a prince to find his princess,\" I said. A princess in disguise. The accident had been a turning point for me, as well. I remembered the fear I\u0027d experienced when I received the call that Macy had been hurt. The thought of losing her had clarified everything. That accident had shown me what my heart had been trying to tell me from the day I met her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0027m a stubborn, willful man, I hadn\u0027t been ready to accept that I\u0027d fallen for Macy. I tried to get her out of my head, out of my life, but nothing had worked. Now I was grateful my puny efforts hadn\u0027t succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was that I\u0027d grown comfortable wallowing in pain, comfortable with the anger I felt at losing Hannah. I was at ease with my grief. But Macy had changed that. Falling in love with her meant I had to let go of my grief and, shockingly, that was hard. I had to reach out toward life and, frankly, I found that frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had dinner together. Macy insisted on cooking, with my assistance. We worked side by side in her kitchen, laughing and teasing each other, interspersing our tasks with lengthy kisses. The radio played rock favorites from the seventies and eighties, and we managed to dance and sing while we assembled the ingredients for the salmon casserole. Apparently, this recipe wasn\u0027t all that different from the one she sometimes made for her cats, because Lovie, Peace and Snowball meowed at us in three-part harmony. Macy put me in charge of the salad. The lettuce was from Harvey\u0027s garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I set the table?\" I asked when I\u0027d finished tossing everything in the large ceramic bowl. Not that I could see the table. Macy had stacked newspapers and books and accumulated stuff on top of it. I started shifting things into new piles on the floor. I made a heroic attempt not to wince as I did so and consoled myself that the floor was scrupulously clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oven timer went off, and Macy removed the casserole, then took over rearranging the books and papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, she tried the salmon dish and blinked. \"Oh, dear, I think I might\u0027ve mixed up the recipes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wouldn\u0027t surprise me, seeing how often we\u0027d stopped to kiss during our preparations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid this might be the one I use for making cat food. Oh, well. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\" She laughed. \"Just kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t be the first time for me, either,\" I said wryly. \"At least we have a fine Merlot to wash it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf someone had asked me what dinner tasted like, I couldn\u0027t really have said--except that the casserole was better than cat food. What I remember most was how much I enjoyed being with Macy. I helped wash the dishes after the meal and afterward we watched TV, sitting on the sofa with the three cats piled on our laps. Sammy was keeping Harvey company tonight. Needless to say, we paid far more attention to each other than the medical drama on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch later, as I drove home, I realized I wanted every night to be like this. No one could be more shocked than I was at the speed with which things had changed. But despite our differences, despite everything, I was certain of my feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following afternoon, before I joined Patrick, Ritchie and Steve for our poker night, I stopped at the jeweler\u0027s and picked out an engagement ring. I planned to ask Macy to marry me the night of the awards dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I spent so long at the jeweler\u0027s, I was late for poker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027ve you been?\" Ritchie asked when I got to his house. The others were already there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like you to be late,\" Patrick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had something to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might as well own up. \"I\u0027ve decided to ask Macy to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie\u0027s eyes widened and he immediately glanced at my left hand. Earlier that day I\u0027d taken off my wedding ring--the one Hannah had placed on my finger. For me removing the ring was a momentous act, not something I\u0027d done lightly. Still, I expected Ritchie to tell me it was too soon and that I needed to think this over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t. \"You sure?\" was all he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As sure as the day I asked Hannah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I tell you?\" Ritchie grinned. \"I knew all along it would be her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Hannah did, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eW inter stared at the computer screen, rereading Pierre\u0027s e-mail. He\u0027d written to remind her that their three-month separation was about to end and asked if she still wanted to meet on July 1 to discuss their options. Unless, of course, she had a new relationship with that doctor she\u0027d mentioned. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-39.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
