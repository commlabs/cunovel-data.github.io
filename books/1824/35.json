I\u0027ll check the safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be sure to close it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did Will need his passport? Was he thinking about running? Allison jumped up from the table and ran after her cousin. He was in the den standing at the bookcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in the doorway and asked, \"Why are you looking for your passport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might be taking a trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t run away. They\u0027d find you, and you\u0027d spend years in prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled around to face her. \"Who said anything about running away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see the fear in his eyes. There were tears there, too. He really was scared. She was about to respond when her aunt summoned her back into the dining room by bellowing her name. She returned and, standing at the head of the table, in a quiet voice asked, \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncle grabbed her arm and squeezed. \"You sit down and listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to need you to get more modeling assignments,\" her aunt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncle pulled her into the chair. \"Quite a few more,\" he added with a brusque nod. \"And that means you\u0027re going to have to branch out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know. Work for other outfits,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he think she could just knock on Chanel\u0027s door and tell them she would be willing to work for them? Or Armani? They really don\u0027t have a clue, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath and said, \"I\u0027m not going to quit school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are,\" her aunt snapped. \"You do what\u0027s needed for this family. Stop being so ungrateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was, that five-dollar word she threw around all the time. Allison wondered how many times she\u0027d say it again before the conversation was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The decision has been made,\" her uncle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who made this decision?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere it goes, she thought. She tried to pull away, but her uncle increased his grip on her wrist. It felt as though he was going to snap her bone in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said with firm resolve in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? No what?\" her aunt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No to all of it. I don\u0027t care how many decisions you\u0027ve made, Uncle Russell. I\u0027m not going to help you. I\u0027m done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir reaction was almost comical. They looked flabbergasted. Her uncle was the first to recover from his shock. \"You are not done here. You\u0027re done when I say you\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed her arm again, twisting until it burned. She tried to jerk her arm back, but her uncle held tight until he wanted to refill his glass. He had to let go of her then. Alcohol trumped keeping her captive, she supposed. She watched him pour a generous splash of whiskey and down it in a single gulp, wiping his chin on his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scooted her chair so he couldn\u0027t reach her and said, \"I wanted to tell you face-to-face so there wouldn\u0027t be any misunderstanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us what?\" her aunt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aunt looked up at her, her eyes flashing with hostility. \"What do you mean, you\u0027re finished?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ever coming back here, and it\u0027s my hope that I will never have to see or talk to either one of you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had rendered them speechless. She knew why. She had never defied either of them before, and now she was severing all connections. She stood and headed to the front door before her uncle could get up from his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back here,\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept right on walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill followed her onto the porch. \"I found my passport,\" he said to her. He shoved a legal-size manila envelope at her. \"This was in the safe, too,\" he explained. \"It has your dad\u0027s name on it. I figured you should have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like legal papers of some kind,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you giving them to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To piss them off. I heard you tell them you aren\u0027t ever coming back here. Did you mean it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I meant it.\" She started down the steps, then stopped. \"I\u0027ll try to help you if I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and turned to go back inside. He didn\u0027t say good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard her uncle yelling her name again and continued on to her car. After taking one last glance at the house she\u0027d grown up in, she drove away and didn\u0027t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt liberated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe euphoric feeling didn\u0027t last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was anxious to get back to Boston. She glanced down at the envelope on the seat next to her. She was curious but decided to wait until she was at the house and in her room before opening it. A mile out of Emerson, her phone began to ring. She looked at the screen and saw that the caller wasn\u0027t identified. It was obvious her aunt had blocked her phone number so that Allison wouldn\u0027t know who was calling and would answer. The phone didn\u0027t stop ringing, and within twenty minutes there were eleven messages. When she stopped for gas, Allison listened to each one of them and was thoroughly disgusted by her aunt\u0027s crude remarks and threats.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-35.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
