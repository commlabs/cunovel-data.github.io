{"id":13499,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. ADIN DUNHAM\u0027S TROUBLE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Arriving in New York, Dean was tempted to buy a handsome suit of clothes, being fully able to spare the money. But on second thought he contented himself with purchasing a cheap, ready-made suit at one of the large clothing stores on the Bowery. He wanted to surprise his uncle and aunt. Besides, he wished to see what kind of a reception his old friends would give him if he appeared in shabby attire and apparent poverty. He could let them know the truth later on. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The evening before his arrival in Waterford Adin Dunham had another call from Squire Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you got my interest ready, neighbor Dunham?\" he inquired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, squire; I can give you a part of it, as I told you the other day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That will not answer,\" said Bates in an uncompromising264 tone. \"I need the money at once. Some of my recent investments have paid me poorly, and though I would like to be considerate I cannot favor you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will try to borrow the money. Perhaps Dean can let me have twenty dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean!\" repeated Squire Bates with a sneer. \"Do you think I can wait till you hear from him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have heard from him,\" answered the carpenter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You have heard from your nephew! Where is he?\" Squire Bates asked in surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here is his letter. It came to hand this morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Squire Bates took the proffered letter and read as follows:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n New York, July 15.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dear Uncle and Aunt:â€”I have got so far on my way home from the West. I will remain here a day or two. Perhaps I can hear of a place, as I suppose there is nothing for me to do in Waterford. I think I shall be with you on Saturday.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Your affectionate nephew,??\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean Dunham.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He doesn\u0027t appear to have made his fortune,\" said the squire, handing back the letter to the carpenter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 265\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He doesn\u0027t say whether he has prospered or not.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If he had he wouldn\u0027t be looking for a boy\u0027s position in New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very likely you\u0027re right, Squire Bates. It\u0027s something that he has been able to get home to his friends.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wait till you\u0027ve seen him,\" said the Squire, significantly. \"He will probably return home in rags.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Even if he does he will be welcome,\" rejoined the carpenter warmly. \"Even if he comes home without a penny, he won\u0027t lack for a welcome, will he, Sarah?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think not, Adin,\" said his wife in mild indignation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is all very pretty and sentimental,\" said the Squire. \"Perhaps you have a fatted calf to kill for the returning prodigal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean never was a prodigal,\" answered Adin Dunham. \"If your friend had treated him well he might have had some money to return with. It wasn\u0027t a very creditable thing to throw the poor boy upon his own resources so far away from home.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We spoke on that subject yesterday, and I distinctly told you that Mr. Kirby had a very good reason to discharge Dean. You didn\u0027t agree with266 me. I suppose it is natural to stand up for your own. However, I will give you three days to make up the interest. That will carry us to Monday. But I shall also require you to pay the mortgage, or else accept my offer for the place. I will give you another week to do that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Squire Bates went out of the room, leaving Adin and Sarah Dunham in some trouble of mind. There seemed to be no help for it. They must be dispossessed of what had been their home for many years.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81503.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:29:01 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:29:01 AM"}
