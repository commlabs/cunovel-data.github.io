He had to keep reminding himself that the Fairy Queen was not all sweetness and light. Not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those two are spreading the rumor that I\u0027m responsible for the theft, hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I hate to say it, but you must admit that there is some logic to their theory. I mean, I do have motive, opportunity, and a good working knowledge of the art world. How hard would it be for a slick operator like me to scam a bunch of locals like A.Z. and Virgil and the Heralds? All I\u0027d have to do is make the picture disappear, tell everyone it got stolen, and then, a few months from now when I\u0027m settled in some big city, make it mysteriously reappear. Presto, my name is suddenly legend in the world of modern art.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not hard,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no one back here in Eclipse Bay would have a clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one but me,\" he corrected mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t have any way of knowing what had happened, either. Not unless you made it a point to keep up with events in the art world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not take his eyes off the road. \"I\u0027d do that, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say I\u0027d keep up with events concerning you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She mulled that over for a while and then, apparently not knowing what to do with it, let it go. She tightened her arms around her midsection. \"Well, it\u0027s all moot because I did not steal the painting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I explained that to Eugene and Dwayne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" Something in her expression lightened. \"That was very nice of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me. Mr. Nice Guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious,\" she said. \"That rumor about me taking the painting sounds quite logical when you think about it. I can see where reasonable people might start to wonder if I was the thief. After all, I am related to Claudia Banner and everyone knows what she did here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you\u0027re the client. I lose you, I lose my fee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What fee?\" she asked warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good question. Been wondering about that, myself. What fee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not expecting a fee and you know it,\" she said crisply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That right? No fee, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the woods now, climbing the hillside above the town. The cool, green canopy cut the bright sunlight. He watched for the familiar sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop making a joke out of this,\" she said briskly. \"We both know why you\u0027re looking for the painting. You want to help A.Z. and Virgil and the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Means, not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sign inscribed with the faded words Snow\u0027s Cafe came into view. The parking lot was crowded with vehicles ranging from bicycles to Volvos. Most of them, he knew, belonged to students and staff from nearby Chamberlain College. Arizona had catered to that particular clientele since she had opened the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned off the road and parked next to a shiny little yellow Volkswagen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Octavia said coolly, \"the macho-cryptic private eye talk reads well in your books, but it doesn\u0027t go over so great in person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate when that happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unfastened his seat belt and climbed out before she could pursue that line of inquiry. He was not in the mood to explain that the real reason he was playing private eye was because of her. Something Eugene had said came back to him. How does it feel to be led around by your balls?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Eugene for you, a real relationship guru. Downright insightful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the door and started around the rear of the car. By the time he got to her side she was already out of the front seat, moving toward him with a determined stride. She gripped the handbag slung over one shoulder very tightly and there was a dangerous look in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. He was getting hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door of the cafe and ushered her into the pleasant gloom of the comfortably shabby interior. Tough-looking rock stars of another era, thin and angry and wearing a lot of leather, glared down at them from the ancient posters that decorated the walls. The music piped through the old speakers came from the same time warp as the posters, but the decibel level was kept reasonably low so that you could hold a conversation without shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArizona did not spend much time here these days. She relied on employees she recruited from the work-study offices of Chamberlain. She trained a new crew at the beginning of each academic year and she paid them handsomely. The result was a remarkably loyal staff that, in turn, freed her to concentrate on what she saw as her chief mission in life: keeping tabs on the goings-on at the institute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting back to the way you explained things to Eugene and Dwayne.\" Octavia tossed her bag into the booth and slid in beside it. \"Maybe you\u0027d better tell me precisely what you said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to recall precisely what I said.\" He flipped open the plastic-coated menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortions of Arizona\u0027s bill of fare were occasionally updated to reflect passing trends such as soy products and veggie patties, but mostly A.Z. stuck with the basic student food groups: burgers, fries, and pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to me, Nick. I\u0027m very serious here. What did you say to Eugene and Dwayne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that conversation of such great interest to you?\" he asked, not looking up from the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the more I think about it, the more it worries me. I don\u0027t know those two well, but from what I\u0027ve heard about them, it would surprise me if they took good advice willingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to provide an incentive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went very still on the other side of the table. \"That\u0027s what I was afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, don\u0027t worry about it, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried.\" She reached out and plucked the menu from his fingers. \"What magic words did you use to make them back off those rumors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell, he thought. She would probably find out sooner or later, anyway. He lounged against the padded seatback and contemplated her for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lavender and Leather,\" he said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lavender and Leather is the name of a g*y bar located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood in Seattle,\" he explained. \"About a year ago, Eugene and Dwayne went off to the big city, had a few beers, and decided it would be amusing to hang out in the vicinity of the establishment. They planned to entertain themselves hassling some of the patrons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was instantly incensed. \"And here I\u0027ve gone out of my way to be polite to them whenever I see them on the street. I actually felt sorry for those two.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-42.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
