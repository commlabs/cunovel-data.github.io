Then he waved to Kirk, said, \"Good luck, buddy,\" and then he and the rest of them were into their squad cars and gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone at last,\" offered Cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not funny, Cherry,\" retorted Jack. \"You and Felix and the deputy get off your asses and go see about this barricade business.

That seal is real tight.\" He eyed Crow defensively. \"This really is a fine local department here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow returned the look. \"I believe you,\" he replied sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" said Father Adam, \"we\u0027re stymied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027re willing to start shooting peace officers,\" said the deputy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix and Crow traded a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t shoot people anymore,\" said the gunman in a low, firm voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a serious statement,\" the deputy assured him quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" said Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why,\" Kirk asked quickly, \"don\u0027t you just set off the charges now? Before they can stop you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"It\u0027s more than one boom, deputy. We have to level the whole damn structure before they\u0027ll be driven out. We have to plant charges deep into the rubble usually, before they pop. It takes a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl Joplin leaned forward. \"And how long you figure they\u0027ll wait, lawman, after they hear that first detonation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk frowned. \"They won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl nodded. \"We got trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be some way to stop them,\" Adam insisted. The priest scanned the others\u0027 faces. \"What stops the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean besides higher authority we can\u0027t get to in time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCigarettes were lit while everybody thought about it. Suddenly Cat laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" growled Joplin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The media,\" Cat piped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll become terrorists!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme, hatched to complete detail in less than five minutes flat, was pure Cherry Cat. ROTLA, the Republic of Texas Liberation Army, would get on the horn to the Dallas - Fort Worth \"media cretins\" and describe their situation as a hostage crisis. True, they had no hostages. And the mayor and the chief knew better, but with helicopter Mini-cams less than fifteen minutes away, they just might hesitate a little, even after the first explosion, described to the media \"as a symbolic act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just tell \u0027em if they don\u0027t meet our demands we\u0027ll blow up a second building, like the courthouse there. Plus kill all the hostages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What demands?\" Carl Joplin wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A complete list of our nonnegotiable ten-part program will be broadcast over the fascist police trenches at dawn tomorrow,\" replied Cat smoothly and he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Team eyed him like he was from Venus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it!\" twanged a deep voice from over Cat\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man they turned to see was about six feet tall, something under two hundred pounds... and relaxed. Totally and completely at ease, from the hands in his pants pockets to the half smile on his face to the ironic sparkle in his eyes. Felix tried to recall the last time he had seen a man so utterly sure of himself, so completely in control of his world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he remembered - it was the last Texas sheriff he\u0027d met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss!\" cried Kirk happily. \"When did you get in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coupla hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been sniffing around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff laughed and put a hand on his deputy\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see which side of this mess is crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stepped forward. \"What\u0027s the verdict, sheriff? Both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff laughed again. \"Pretty much.\" He stuck out his hand. \"How do you do, Mr. Crow. I\u0027m Richard Hattoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two shook hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to have you,\" said Jack. \"You\u0027re just in time to be our first hostage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHattoy grinned. \"They said you were a smartass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027They?\u0027 Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far as I can tell, everybody who\u0027s ever met you. Kirk, you\u0027re riding with the last of the cowboys here. Been promoted, decorated, and busted down more times than you\u0027ve had safe sex. And not just the military. CIA, DEA, National Security Agency, Treasury... Crow, can\u0027t you find anybody to put up with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so far,\" offered Cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHattoy eyed him. \"You\u0027d be - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still following him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat grinned. \"Don\u0027t let his rank fool you. We all drew straws and he got Kimosabe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That make you Tonto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat shook his head. \"Court jester.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHattoy looked him up and down. \"That figures. Tell me, did you really give up a corporate law practice in Oklahoma City to paint spaceships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Edmond, Oklahoma, and I was a science-fiction book-cover illustrator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat shrugged. \"A hobbit or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" muttered Hattoy and turned to the others. \"Enough small talk. Let\u0027s get to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" asked Kirk nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, deputy. For once you picked right. Mr. Crow checks out with his former associates. Nobody liked him much. And nobody but nobody wants to hire him again - but they do trust him. And he\u0027s got a lot of very important people behind the scenes believing in his vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unofficially, of course,\" added Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unofficial is being generous, I\u0027d say. But it is a backup, of a sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff paused, took his hands out of his pockets, and stretched mightily and yawned and they saw the pistol on his back right hip the size of a Buick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Hattoy went on, \"So. There are vampires and you\u0027re their hunter on this continent is the story I get. If that\u0027s so, what\u0027s your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The problem is your mayor and your police chief,\" said Crow, \"and who knows how many others, are doing what the vampires tell them to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have them under a sort of spell, sheriff,\" said Father Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHattoy eyed the priest unhappily. \"A \u0027spell\u0027...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk spoke up. \"I don\u0027t know what else you\u0027d call it, Richard. We took two jailers outta here that were about bled to death and crying \u0027cause it was over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay... But is that any reason to blow up my goddamned jail and maybe the whole block with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow shook his head. \"Not possible, sheriff. The charges are too small. You might lose a next-door window or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHattoy\u0027s tone was one of withering disgust. \"\u0027A window or two\u0027?\" he repeated. \"What about fire? Shouldn\u0027t you have fire trucks all over the area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Crow was starting to get hot. He didn\u0027t like the change in Hattoy\u0027s tone and he didn\u0027t like his antagonistic manner. Just when he thought he had finally found somebody, dammit, with brains enough to see!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sheriff. You\u0027re right about fire trucks. But it wasn\u0027t my idea to seal them out of this area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027re just the one who\u0027s gonna risk a whole city block and maybe a whole downtown by going ahead anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack met his eyes. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You take a lot on yourself, Crow. You think maybe that\u0027s why you got yourself kicked out of every fucking federal agency in the Congressional Registry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that did it for Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two things, sheriff,\" he all but barked. \"One: you find me a president with enough balls to publicly recognize this nightmare and I\u0027ll be his janitor for life. Two: you could lose a couple of blocks. Or downtown. Or this entire one-horse town as far as I\u0027m concerned and I\u0027m not just real sure anybody this side of the interstate would notice, much less care! I\u0027m not killing people, for crissakes! I\u0027m killing old dead buildings. I\u0027m trying to save the people in this dump. Or maybe you think the ones that died so far are AIDS victims?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look. We can kill two master vampires today. But only today. We know where they are. And they can\u0027t move for...\" He looked up at the inexorable sun sinking lower and lower. Crow pointed at the horizon. \"That\u0027s all the time we\u0027ve got. It\u0027s a chance that won\u0027t come again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s a chance I\u0027m fucking well gonna take if you send the marines in here! Risk? Risk? Lemme tell you something, Hattoy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck your buildings and fuck your town and fuck your mayor and if you aren\u0027t going to help us - knowing we\u0027re right - just because you\u0027re afraid of a little risk... Well, then, fuck... you... too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence for three long beats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the sheriff said, without taking his eyes off Crow, \"I can see why you like him, Kirk. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk, dumfounded, managed, \"Where to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I gotta save this here Jack Crow hero type and then get him outta town... before I have to kick his butt in half for talking to me that way. C\u0027mon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then as they were walking away the sheriff looked at Felix, looked down at his hand, and Felix followed his gaze and only then realized he was carrying the squashed Browning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having a little pistol trouble, boy?\" whispered the sheriff and then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix lifted his hand in front of his face and looked at what was left of the gun. In the sunlight the marks of the monster\u0027s fingers were clear. No machine could have vised like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow when, he wondered, did I find time to pick this up? And when, he wondered next, glancing down at his second pistol back in its holster, did I put this one back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, he didn\u0027t even remember drawing the second gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, he asked then, is this luck going to run dry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, Carl was arguing with Crow over the sheriff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... testing you, Jack. Picture this from his point of view for a second. It\u0027s one thing to call up some old favors and have you checked out. But this is his town. He had to read this face-to-face. And if you hadn\u0027t shown the balls to stand up to him for what you knew you had to do... Well, he probably wondered why you didn\u0027t detonate up front. Probably wondered why you tried to go inside in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" offered Cat quietly and Carl didn\u0027t like the look that passed briefly between Cat and Crow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was trying to piss you off,\" Carl went on quickly. \"I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t see that one coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack lit a cigarette, looked tired. \"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl\u0027s voice grew gentle. \"Rough in there, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hadn\u0027t opened that door,\" replied Jack Crow softly, \"or if you had waited just five more minutes to open it, we\u0027d all be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix,\" said Cat. \"Show him the gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix tossed the lump to Carl and sat down on the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl caught it and drew in a sharp breath. \"It did this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix lit a cigarette and nodded without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl shook his head. \"Wow,\" he muttered softly. \"Strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s voice sounded odd: \"Yeah. Strong. Unreal strong. Strong like we never imagined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something,\" muttered Cat, \"for you to look forward to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" asked Carl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat lit a smoke of his own. \"Haven\u0027t you heard? Jack\u0027s going to be a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not funny, Cherry,\" growled Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not meant to be, buddy,\" was the response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is all this?\" Carl wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a fact,\" drawled Cat. \"We just heard from his recruiter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for one thing we mostly just listened and for another thing, it wasn\u0027t her. It was him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man. And I don\u0027t think he came up because he was thirstier than she was, Carl. I think he came up to kill us and take Jack here and make him a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they told Carl about the exploding elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd about the crossbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl looked pale. \"He actually caught it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what range?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl stared. \"Lord!\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Gods\u0027 is the way he put it,\" said the previously silent Father Adam. The priest\u0027s voice was hard. \"He said they were gods and he said we were fools with wooden stakes. He said Jack was the pope\u0027s altar boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl blinked. \"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Cat: \"He doesn\u0027t like white crosses - but they can\u0027t kill him. He\u0027s not afraid of... what was it? Garlic? He said he\u0027d break Felix\u0027s back or something if he even pointed a gun at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Felix do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shot him anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Way to go, Felix!\" gushed Carl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Felix, from his seat on the curb, turned and gave him a dead look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then nobody wanted to talk about it anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough of this,\" cried Cat suddenly. \"What about the sheriff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Jack, \"we better get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd everyone, save Cat, seemed to move at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat stared at them. \"You seem pretty sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl grinned, shrugged. \"He said he\u0027d handle it, Cherry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat frowned. \"He\u0027s only one guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl grinned some more. \"He\u0027s a Texas sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he has Kirk with him,\" added Jack, his own grin faint but still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" drawled Cat dryly. \"That makes two of \u0027em. What are they gonna do? Arrest them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl stopped what he was doing, said, \"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mayor? The chief of police? All his cops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he has to. Cat. He\u0027s a Texas sher - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I know. You keep saying that. So, he can handle it. Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the most part, that\u0027s just what happened. Team Crow never did get the details. All Kirk would say was some mumbling about the sheriff walking up to the barricades and telling \u0027em to break it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later the Team had fire trucks and firemen and ambulances and police protection and demolition advisers the chief had brought in originally to stop them and all sorts of experts on local buildings like the jail. They even had structural plans and advice on how to blow it, and Carl and Cat did, in fact, move three of the charges a couple of yards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHattoy showed up in time to press the detonator personally, saying, \"All my life I\u0027ve wanted to kaboom one of these things.\" This was just smoke, of course, to hide his adding another layer of his personal authority on the event in case of future hassle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey blew it once, twice, three times, in layers. Then they blew the rubble. Then they blew it some more before the female emerged, rocketing upward in a hail of bricks and screeching. She popped on Adam\u0027s side and the priest came through once more, taking only two quick steps on the uneven surface before delivering a clean bisecting shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t appear until a half hour before dusk, a fullthroated scarlet fountain of hatred and fury. His screams were ear-splitting. His flames were supernaturally bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in daylight it didn\u0027t matter. Jack had seen it all before. He did get close enough to recognize the monster who knew his name before punching the crossbow through the burning chest. But there was nothing special about the shot. Or the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re a vampire, Crow...\" it had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack watched the ashes burn all the way down, then whispered, \"Not today, little god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there awhile, lit and smoked a cigarette before moving. When he finally turned away, toward the Team now milling with the sheriff and his people, the realization struck deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, that was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then: Why did I try to go inside? I almost killed everyone! What was I trying to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was three years, three months, and some-odd days of this madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God Felix can shoot...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-19.html","bookId":2118,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM"}
