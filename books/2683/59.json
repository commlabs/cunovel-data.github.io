You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really happening place,\" I yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waitress walks by.

I watch her move away, thinking two words: not bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have a runway show at six?\" Palakon asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a model. I\u0027m a lush. But it\u0027s cool. I\u0027m cool.\" I suddenly realize something. \"Wait-is this like an intervention or something?\" I ask. \"Because I\u0027ve laid off the blow for-jeez, it must be weeks now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward,\" Palakon starts, his patience snapping. \"Supposedly you dated this girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dated Ashley Fields?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Jamie Fields and at one point somewhere in your past yes, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested in any of this, man,\" I point out. \"I thought you were a DJ, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie Fields disappeared three weeks ago from the set of an independently financed movie that was being shot in London. The last sightings of Jamie Fields were at the Armani store on Sloane Street and L\u0027Odeon on Regent Street.\" Palakon sighs, flips through his file. \"She has not been heard from since she left the set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she didn\u0027t like the script.\" I shrug. \"Maybe she felt they didn\u0027t develop her character well enough.

Her agent. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have been unconfirmed sightings in Bristol, but that was ten days ago,\" Palakon says. \"Basically we have not been able to locate her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby?\" I lean in again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, yes?\" He leans in too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\"You\u0027re pitching a concept nobody gets,\" I say quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she\u0027s an MTA?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Model-turned-actress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModels are sashaying endlessly down runways on the giant screen above the Arc de Triomphe, even Chloe a couple of times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever see me on the cover of YouthQuake magazine?\" I ask suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er... yes.\" Palakon has trouble admitting this, for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool.\" I pause. \"Can I borrow two hundred dollars from you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool.
