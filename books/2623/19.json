The threshold\u0027s still a long way off.\u0027 The boss shook his head. \u0027Otherwise, I think the Day Watch and the Night Watch would have wiped each other out already. The second path . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin line, leading away from the black stripe. Broken off abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ehmination of the target. If the target dies, the vortex will disperse . . . of its own accord.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabulon stirred and said politely:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m prepared to help with this little initiative. The Night Watch cannot carry it out on its own, I believe? We are at your service.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. Then the boss laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As you wish,\u0027 said Zabulon with a shrug. \u0027I repeat, for the time being we offer you our assistance. We don\u0027t want a global catastrophe that will wipe out millions of people in an instant. Not yet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The third path,\u0027 said the boss, looking at me. \u0027Watch carefully.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother line, branching off from the main root, gradually growing thinner and fading away to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s what happens if you get involved, Anton.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do I have to do?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know. Probability forecasting has never been an exact science. I only know one thing: you can remove the vortex.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly had the stupid idea that maybe I was still being tested. A field work test ... I\u0027d killed the vampire, and now . . . But it couldn\u0027t be. Not with such high stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve never removed any black vortices.\u0027 My voice sounded different, not exactly frightened, more surprised. The Dark Magician Zabulon giggled repellently, in a woman\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boss nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know that, Anton.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, pulled his gown around him and walked up to me. He looked absurd, or at least his oriental garb seemed like an awkward parody in the setting of an ordinary Moscow apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nobody has ever removed any vortices like this one. You\u0027ll be the first to try.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And don\u0027t forget, Anton, if you mess this up, even just a tiny bit, anything at all, you\u0027ll be the first to burn. You won\u0027t even have enough time to withdraw into the Twilight. You know what happens to Light Ones when they\u0027re caught in an Inferno eruption?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat went dry. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Pardon me, my dear enemy,\u0027 Zabulon said mockingly, \u0027but don\u0027t you allow your colleagues the right to choose? In such situations, even in wartime, it has always been usual to call for volunteers.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve already made our call for volunteers,\u0027 the boss snapped without turning round. \u0027We\u0027ve all been volunteers for a long time already. And we don\u0027t have any choice.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But we do. Always.\u0027 The Dark Magician laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027When we acknowledge that humans have the right to choose, we deprive ourselves of it, Zabulon,\u0027 said Boris Ignatievich, with a glance at the Dark Magician. \u0027You\u0027re playing to the wrong audience here. Don\u0027t interfere.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I say no more.\u0027 Zabulon lowered his head and shrank down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Give it your best shot,\u0027 said the boss. \u0027Anton, I can\u0027t give you any advice. Try. I beg you, please, try. And . . . forget everything you\u0027ve been taught. Don\u0027t believe anything I\u0027ve said, don\u0027t believe what you wrote in your course notes, don\u0027t believe your own eyes, don\u0027t believe what anyone else says.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then what do I believe, Boris Ignatievich?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If I knew that, Anton, I\u0027d walk straight out of this headquarters and over to that building myself.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both looked out the window simultaneously. The black vortex was still swirling, swaying from side to side. Someone walking along the pavement suddenly turned to face into the snow and started making a wide circle round the stalk of the vortex. I noticed a path had already been trodden along the edge of the road: the people couldn\u0027t see the Evil straining to strike their world, but they could sense its approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll watch Anton,\u0027 Olga said. \u0027Back him up and maintain communications.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027From outside,\u0027 the boss agreed. \u0027Only from outside. Anton, go. We\u0027ll do the best we can to screen you from any kind of observation.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl flew up off the bed and landed on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my friends, then at the Dark Magician – he looked like he\u0027d gone into hibernation – and walked out of the room. The noise in the rest of the apartment faded immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey showed me out in total silence, without any unnecessary words, without any shoulder-slapping or helpful advice. After all, what I was doing wasn\u0027t such a big deal. I was only on my way to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo quiet somehow, even for a Moscow commuter suburb at that late hour. As if everyone had shut themselves in at home, turned out the lights and huddled down with their heads under the blankets, keeping quiet, saying nothing. Quiet, but not sleeping. The only movement was the trembling of the blue and red spots in the windows – the TVs were switched on everywhere. It\u0027s become a habit already, when you\u0027re afraid, when you\u0027re suffering – switch on the TV and watch absolutely everything, from the teleshopping to the news. People can\u0027t see the Twilight world. But they are capable of sensing how close it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olga, what can you tell me about this vortex?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nothing definite.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood at the entrance, watching the stalk of the vortex flexing like an elephant\u0027s trunk. I didn\u0027t feel like going in just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027When . . . what size of vortex can you extinguish?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Five metres high, and I have a shot at it. Three metres and it\u0027s a sure thing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And would the girl survive if you did that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She might.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something bothering me. In this unnatural silence, with even the cars in the street trying to avoid this doomed district of the city, there were still some sounds left . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it hit me. The dogs were howling. In all the apartments in all the buildings on all sides, the miserable dogs were complaining to their owners – in quiet, pitiful, helpless voices. They could see the Inferno moving closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olga, information about the girl. All of it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Svetlana Nazarova. Twenty-five years old. Physician, employed in polyclinic number seventeen. Has never previously come to the attention of the Night Watch. Has never previously come to the attention of the Day Watch. No magical powers detected. Her parents and younger brother live in Brateevo, she maintains occasional contact with them, mostly by phone. Four close girlfriends, currently being checked, so far nothing exceptional. Relations with other people equable, no serious hostility observed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A doctor,\u0027 I said thoughtfully. \u0027That\u0027s a lead, Olga. Some old man or old woman dissatisfied with their treatment. There\u0027s often an upsurge of latent magical powers in old age.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s being checked out,\u0027 Olga replied. \u0027So far nothing\u0027s turned up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no point, it was stupid making wild guesses, people cleverer than I am had already been working on the girl for half a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What else?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Blood group O. No serious illnesses, occasional mild cardiac arrhythmia. First sexual contact at the age of seventeen, with one of her peers, out of curiosity. She was married four months, has been divorced for two years, relations with her ex-husband have remained equable. No children.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The husband\u0027s powers?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He hasn\u0027t any. Neither does his new wife. That\u0027s the first thing that was checked.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Enemies?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Two female ill-wishers at work. Two rejected admirers at work. A school friend who tried to get a fake sick-note six months ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She refused.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, well. And how much magic have they got?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Next to none. Their malevolence quotient is ordinary. They all have only weak magical powers. They couldn\u0027t create a vortex like this one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Any patients died? Recently?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027None.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then where did the curse come from?\u0027 Yes, now I could see why the Watch had got nowhere with this. Svetlana had turned out to be a thoroughgoing goody-two-shoes. Five enemies in twenty-five years – that was something to be proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlga didn\u0027t answer my rhetorical question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve got to go,\u0027 I said. I turned towards the windows where I could see the two guards\u0027 silhouettes. One of them waved to me. \u0027Olga, how did Ignat try to work this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The standard approach. A meeting in the street, the \"diffident intellectual\" line. Coffee in a bar. Conversation. A rapid rise in the mark\u0027s attraction level. He bought champagne and liqueurs, they came here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And after that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The vortex started to grow.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And the reason?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There was none. She liked Ignat, in fact she was starting to feel strongly attracted. But at precisely that moment the vortex started to grow catastrophically fast. Ignat ran through three styles of behaviour and managed to get an unambiguous invitation to stay the night. That was when the vortex shifted gear into explosive growth. He was recalled. The vortex stabilised.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How was he recalled?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was frozen through already, and my boots felt horribly damp on my feet. And I still wasn\u0027t ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The \"sick mother\" line. A call to his mobile phone, he apologised, promised to call her tomorrow. There were no hitches, the mark didn\u0027t get suspicious.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And the vortex stabilised?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlga didn\u0027t answer, she was obviously communicating with the analysts. Then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It even shrank a little bit. Three centimetres. But that might just be natural recoil when the energy input\u0027s cut off.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something in all this, but I couldn\u0027t formulate my vague suspicions clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where\u0027s her practice, Olga?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right here, we\u0027re in it. It includes this house. Patients often come to her apartment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Excellent. Then I\u0027ll go as a patient.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you need any help implanting false memories?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll manage.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The boss says okay,\u0027 Olga replied after a pause. \u0027Go ahead. Your persona is: Anton Gorodetsky, programmer, unmarried, under observation for three years, diagnosis – stomach ulcer, resident in this building, apartment number sixty-four. It\u0027s empty right now, if necessary we can provide backup on that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Three years is too much for me,\u0027 I confessed. \u0027A year. One year, max.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Olga and she looked at me with those unblinking bird\u0027s eyes, and somewhere in there I could still see part of that dirty, aristocratic woman who\u0027d drunk cognac with me in my kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good luck,\u0027 she said. \u0027Try to reduce the size of the vortex. Ten metres at least . . . then I\u0027ll risk it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bird flew up into the air and instantly withdrew into the Twilight, down into the very deepest layers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-19.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
