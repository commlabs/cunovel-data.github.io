At that time, Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate and held out the white little tiger to Shangguan Bing’er, saying: “Here, a gift for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For me?” Shangguan Bing’er looked at Zhou Weiqing in surprise. “Little Fatty, don’t you know the value of a youngling Heavenly Beast? Even a youngling of one of those Forest Direwolves that we just killed, each of them can be sold for more than a thousand gold pieces. This little white tiger of yours, I can’t even imagine the price.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said suavely: “That doesn’t matter, I wouldn’t be able to bear to give it to anyone else, but it’s totally different for you.” [1. +1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListening to him say that, Shangguan Bing’er blushed once again, but she did not reject him this time. She really did like this cute little white tiger, it was just too adorable, and she reached out for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a strange scene appeared; when the little white tiger saw that Zhou Weiqing was giving it away, it grew angry, its four little claws unsheathing as it bared its fangs at Shangguan Bing’er fiercely. Alas, it was just too small and cute for that, and the ferocity was just not convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ehh, seems like it does not like me.” Shangguan Bing’er said curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing also discovered the same thing; earlier when he had picked up the little white tiger, the little fellow had not put up any resistance at all. They both exchanged looks and Zhou Weiqing muttered: “Perhaps this little thing was attracted by the tiger’s roar I let out during my Demonic Change last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said: “That’s very possible, why don’t you hug it and see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing followed suit and hugged the little tiger, and as expected, it stopped struggling, instead snuggling close to his chest and rubbing against it, stretching itself in a comfortable position and closing its eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stroked the little tiger’s back, playing with its fur as he felt amused in his heart. Of course, he really liked this little thing as well. In his eyes, there were two animals that he considered the most beautiful, one was horses, and the other was tigers. Horses’ beauty lay in their vigorous and healthy body and shape, while tigers’ beauty lay in their imperious aura, their beautiful lines and their grace and poise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had never touched a tiger’s fur before, he could still sense that the little thing was very special. Normally, no matter how gorgeous or colourful a tiger’s stripes were, its fur shouldn’t be this soft, yet caressing this little thing felt as if he was stroking a piece of silk, and was extremely comfortable. Furthermore, it felt so soft and pliable as if it were boneless; although it was still rather tiny, but no matter where he touched it, it felt soft and meaty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing flipped the little tiger around in his embrace, and gave a strange laugh, saying: “Haha, it’s a little female tiger! Bing’er, look, these little protrusions, do you think they’ll be for feeding milk next time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er flushed once again, knocking him hard on the head and said: “What’s your head filled with! You’re not allowed to bully it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little white tiger was also very angry, as it cried out, struggling to turn around, and giving Zhou Weiqing’s hand a bite. However, it did not bite very hard, now even breaking his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “Look! It even knows how to be shy, such an interesting little fellow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly: “You better spend more time thinking of how you’re going to head back to the camp. Are you going to go back in this state?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uhhh…” Zhou Weiqing scratched his head embarrassedly, then his eyes lit up as he thought of a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the two of them stealthily entered the camp, the Personal Aide Zhou Little Fatty was dressed in a common soldier’s attire, and a poor sentry of the Heavenly Bow Empire was stripped naked...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they finally reached their tents, the two heaved a huge sigh of relief. Shangguan Bing’er looked at Zhou Weiqing with a complicated look in her eyes and said: “Little Fatty, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing paused for a while, finally sighed and said: “Bing’er, honestly speaking, you are very kindhearted by nature, and I do not think your nature is suitable for joining the army. A soldier needs to be cold and ruthless, and that’s something your nature will not allow. I do think it’s the right decision for you to resign as Battalion Commander, and perhaps to leave the army too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er looked a little dazed, and asked: “What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing immediately stuck out his chest and said proudly: “Of course I’ll follow you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who wants you to follow me.” Shangguan Bing’er muttered softly, but her gentle voice held a tinge of happiness. Her radiant beauty at that moment caused Zhou Weiqing to stare, transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel like my Heavenly Energy is a little off, I’m heading back to my tent to cultivate. As for the future…” Shangguan Bing’er hesitated a little before continuing: “I’ll wait for the orders from headquarters before deciding.” After she said that, she disappeared in a flash, going back into her tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and headed back to his own tent feeling rather satisfied, hugging the little white tiger. In his heart, he was thinking to himself: \u003ci\u003eLooks like, this wife will not escape!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he entered his tent, he prepared a basin of water and cleansed the dirt off his body. He couldn’t help but look at his reflection in his water and said smugly: “Zhou Weiqing, you’re really getting more and more handsome everything! Wahaha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not notice that the little white tiger which he had thrown at the side, had now very cutely lifted its two front paws, covering its eyes in a very human-like manner, even rolling its eyes at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe place where the Forest Direwolves and the Direwolf King had died.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo shadowy white figures appeared out of nowhere; they were two middle aged men, both dressed in white with a head of silver, blue eyes shining and a majestic aura surrounding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white robed man on the left furrowed his eyebrow, asking in puzzlement: “Her Highness’ aura stopped here, how is that possible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man on the right looked at the surrounding corpses, his eyes filled with a thread of fear. “Could it be… these Heavenly Beasts killed Her Highness? If not for that, how could this be possible, with our Snow God Perception, we would definitely be able to sense her aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white robed man on the left said solemnly: “Don’t make wild guesses. Even if Her Highness is weak during this period of her transformation, such weak Heavenly Beasts could never be able to injure her, let alone kill her. If Her Highness releases her aura, these Heavenly Beasts would have been literally scared to death. Lao Er [2. Literally means Old 2nd, usually an affectionate tone to call, like 2nd brother], check how these direwolves died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright.” After a short while, the man on the right returned after his checks, with surprise and doubt in his eyes as he said: “Such a strange, evil aura. These direwolves died around 8 hours ago, but the evil aura from the has not dissipated. The most terrifying thing is that there isn’t any of their Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy remaining in their bodies, as if they had been drained completely. A powerful Heavenly Beast must have came here, perhaps even a Heavenly Evil Beast. I understand now, Her Highness must be together with that Heavenly Evil Beast, and its aura is covering her aura, that’s why we aren’t able to detect it. Big bro, what do we do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
