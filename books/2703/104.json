I wanted to thank him, pile my own heap of sweetness right back onto him, and praise him for being...him. But I’m pretty sure he’d just scrambled all rational thought right out of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what I ended up saying was, “There’s more, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes sparkled as he nodded. My gaze fell down to his cock where he was still kneeling between my spread legs. Hard, and long, and completely intimidating, it dripped with anticipation, stirring up a new arousal in me I had thought for sure he’d licked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, I’d been worried about the fit, but after his finger had been in me and I’d loved the way it had filled me—and had wanted even more filling me—I was actually eager to feel the real deal. Spreading my legs wider, I lifted my hips to him, displaying everything I had to let him know I wanted it. I had no clue where my inhibitions had gone, but with Quinn Hamilton hard and dripping before me, those things had highjacked themselves out my body and taken a vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Show me,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, he nodded without speaking. After spotting his crumpled jeans hanging off the side of the bed, he dug into the back pocket, pulled out his wallet and flipped it open. As he pulled out a condom, a moment of reality struck. Hard. I experienced another slap of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d probably bought that condom, thinking he’d use it on my roommate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. What was I doing? I shouldn’t be doing this. He was Cora’s. She’d had him first, and probably opened herself in this very position to him many times. I should never be allowed—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he tore open the package and began to sheathe himself. It was beautiful to watch. He rolled the small layer of latex down with such care, holding on to the tip as he went. Then he wrapped his fist around the base as if to insure everything was in proper place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he started to let go, I choked out a sound of resistance. “No. Don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, startled. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed, embarrassed by what I wanted and averted my gaze. “Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, tell me. Zoey, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my hip and looked so worried, as if he thought I might stop everything, I had to tell him. Ducking my face, I admitted, “I...I liked watching you...touch it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth fell open. He looked down at himself and then back up to me. Then his lips twitched. “What? Like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched himself again, rewrapping his palm around his thick girth. Then he went and pumped his fist slowly up and down the entire length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God.” I drew in an awestruck breath. “Yeah. Like that. Is that...is that how you masturbate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and closed this eyes, his throat working as he kept on with the movement of his hand. “This is what I did when I thought about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s breathtaking,” I didn’t mean to admit aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pupils seemed to dilate and his shallow pants went even more erratic. “You could do it too.” When his gaze slid between my legs, a spark of arousal shot through my pussy, startling me. “You could touch yourself where I just touched you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth worked before I could form the words. “W-would that...I mean, would you like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace going from red to deep purple, he nodded, his eyes intent. “Only as much as you seem to like watching me do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Wow. That much, huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly, hesitantly reached down. But my fingers had barely begun to fondle, eliciting an excited tremble in my womb, when Quinn lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” he rasped, his teeth locked tight as he stared dumbfounded at my hand between my legs. “I can’t...I’m sorry, I can’t wait. I have to...” He let go of himself to grasp my thighs. As he pulled me down toward him, into his lap, he thrust his hips forward. Like two matching pieces of a puzzle, we came together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn pushed inside me without pause or hesitation. I cried out from the shock and nip of pain as he filled me completely. His overly long eyelashes fluttered as he tipped his head back, making the muscles in his throat strain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said something, then said it again. I wasn’t sure if it was Jesus or Jeez or a strange version of both, but the word seemed to be ripped out of him. When he finally looked down at me, he appeared dazed and drugged. But he only had to glance into my eyes before his own widened with realization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh shit, Zoey. I’m inside you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” If there was only one thing in the world I knew in that moment, it was that he was full and hard and deep inside me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-104.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
