The sun was near setting, and Philip feared another long black night with the forest screeching around him. Guillermo Sala was out there somewhere, surely waiting for the proper time to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring off toward the distant village of Villacuacha, Philip sent a whispered prayer to the two Indian runners. “Hurry, you bastards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong a jungle trail, Friar Otera glanced toward the setting sun, then pulled the cowl of his robe higher over his head, shadowing his features. They should be at the ruins by midday tomorrow. “Come,” he ordered, and led the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind, a row of five brown-robed monks kept pace with him. The brush of their robes was the only sound disturbing the twilight forest. The jungle always grew strangely quiet as the sun began to set, hushed as if the creatures of the forest held their breath against the dangers of the approaching night. Soon the dark predators would be loose again for the hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this pregnant silence that allowed the black-haired friar to hear the snap of a branch and the ragged huffing breath of someone approaching. He cocked his head. No, two men approached. Friar Otera held up an arm and, without a word, the others stopped. The Church had trained them well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon two bare-chested Indians appeared along the trail ahead. Sweat shone off their sleek bodies as if they were aglow in the last rays of the sun. On closer inspection, it was clear the two, thorn-scratched and shaky of limb, had traveled far and at a hard pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin his cowl, the friar’s lips drew to hard lines of satisfaction. Though he hated his poor upbringing here among the Indians, it now proved useful. As a boy, he had been chased and tormented because he was of mixed blood, a half-bred mestizo. The shadowy jungle trails became his only sanctuary from the constant ridicule and he knew these jungle trails as well as any. He also knew any attempt to call for help must travel this trail—and he had his orders. Friar Otera raised a palm in greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the Indians seemed wary of the group of strangers. Wisely so, since the jungles were the haunts of many guerrillas and marauders. But soon recognition of their robed raiments and silver crosses filled the Indian’s eyes. He dropped to his knees, chattering his thanks in guttural Quecha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera bowed his head, crossing his wrists within the long folds of his sleeves. One hand reached the dagger’s hilt in his hidden wrist sheath. “Fear not, my child. Calm yourself. Tell me what has happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friar… Father, we have run far. Seeking help. We are workers for some norte americanos high in the mountains. There was an accident. A horrible accident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An accident?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An underground tomb has collapsed, trapping some of the americanos. They will die unless we hurry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera shook his head sadly. “Horrible indeed,” he muttered in his native Quecha, though inwardly it galled him to do so. The old language, a crude derivation of the Incan language called runa simi, was so plain and base, the language of the poor. And he hated to be reminded of his own roots by speaking it so fluently. A spark of anger rose in his heart, but he kept it hidden within the shadows of his robe. Friar Otera listened in silence as the frantic Indian finished explaining about the explosion and the damaged satellite phone. He just nodded in understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we must hurry, Father, before it’s too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera licked his lips. So only one of the americanos was still loose among the ruins. How fortuitous. “Yes, we must hurry,” he agreed with the panting Indian. “You have done well bringing us this news, my child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indian lowered his head in thanks and relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera slipped past the kneeling Indian and approached the second fellow. “You have done well, too, my child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis other Indian had remained silent during the exchange and had not knelt. His dark eyes had remained wary. He backed up a step now, somehow sensing the danger, but he was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera lashed out with the long blade hidden at his wrist, slicing cleanly. The man’s hands flew to his slashed throat, trying to stanch the flow of blood. A spraying spurt struck the friar’s robe as the Indian fell to his knees. Too late to pray now, heathen. With a scowl, Friar Otera used his booted foot to topple the gurgling man backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping over the body, Friar Otera continued on his way down the trail. He had not even heard a sound as the other monks dealt with the first Indian. He nodded in satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Church had certainly trained them well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan tried the wine. It was a decent vintage Merlot, not too dry, with a sweet bouquet. She nodded, and the waiter filled her glass the rest of the way. “It should accent the porterhouse nicely,” she said with a shy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the candlelit table, Henry returned her smile. “A forensic pathologist and a wine connoisseur to boot. You’ve grown to be a woman of many surprises. As I recall, you used to be a beer-and-tequila woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stifled a short laugh. “Time has ways of refining one’s taste. As does a stomach that can no longer tolerate such excesses.” She eyed Henry. He still filled his dark suit well, a double-breasted charcoal jacket over a crisp white shirt and pale rose tie. The colors accented perfectly the salting of silver-grey in his dark hair. Clean-shaven and impeccably attired, it was hard to believe this fellow had been tromping through the Peruvian jungles just last week. “And I must say you’re full of surprises, too, Henry. Your years in the field have done you no harm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry, fork in hand, glanced up from the remains of his Caesar salad. He wore a roguish grin, an expression that took Joan back to her college years. “Why, Dr. Engel,” he teased, “if I didn’t know better, I’d say you were trying to pick me up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a simple compliment, Professor Conklin. That’s all. Just a professional courtesy. I say it to all the visiting doctors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah… so that explains your current academic popularity.” Henry stabbed a crouton, hiding a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan feigned insult and snapped her napkin toward his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow.” Henry rubbed his knuckles as if they stung. “Okay, okay… then I guess we’d best stick to business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should,” she said with a tired smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus far, their evening had been spent catching up on each other’s pasts. Joan had nodded when Henry mentioned the death of his wife from cancer. Joan had heard the news from mutual friends. It was about the same time her own marriage had ended in a bitter divorce. Afterward, it seemed both had immersed themselves completely in their respective professions, becoming renowned in their fields. During this time, neither had sought out any intimate relationships, still shy from their wounded hearts. It seemed pain was pain, no matter what the circumstance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you learned anything new about the gold debris found inside the mummy’s skull?” Henry asked more soberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan sat straighter, switching to her more professional demeanor. “Not much. Just that it’s certainly not gold. It’s more of a dense viscid liquid. At room temperatures, it’s moldable, like warm clay. I suspect it’s some type of heavy metal amalgam, perhaps mercury mixed with something else.” She shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry’s brows furrowed, and he shook his head slightly. “It doesn’t make sense. The Incas’ skill with metals was not considered advanced. Even smelting iron was beyond them. I find it strange they could create a new amalgam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, they must have learned something. They filled the mummy’s skull full of the odd metal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I suppose…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But why do you think they did that?” she asked. “Fill his skull?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can only theorize. The Incas revered the braincase as a source of power. They even made drinking mugs from their slain enemies’ skulls. My guess is that the Incas feared the friar’s Christian god and performed this odd rite to avoid the wrath of this foreign deity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan curled her nose. “So they drilled holes in the man’s skull, removed the brain, and filled the space with the amalgam as an offering to the stranger’s god?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry shrugged and nodded. “It’s a theory. The Incas seemed to have a fascination with trepanation. If you took all the skulls from around the world, they would not equal the number of Incan skulls found with such mutilations. So I wager there must be a religious significance to the act. But it’s only a theory so far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And not a bad one, I suppose,” she said with a smile. “But perhaps tomorrow I’ll have more answers for you about the amalgam itself. I contacted Dr. Kirkpatrick at GeorgeWashingtonUniversity, a metallurgy specialist. He owes me a favor. He’s agreed to come by tomorrow and take a look at the substance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry brightened with her words, his eyes glinting. “I’d like to be there when he examines the material.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure…” Joan was momentarily flustered. She had been considering some way to arrange a meeting with Henry again before he left, and here he was dropping it in her lap. “Th… that would be wonderful… your company would be welcome anytime.” Joan mentally struck her forehead with the heel of her hand. Why was she acting like a tongue-tied adolescent? She was forty-eight years old, for Christ’s sake. When would these games between men and women ever grow more comfortable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan found Henry smiling at her. “I’d enjoy working beside you again, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed and wiped her hands on her napkin in her lap. She was saved from having to speak by the server’s arrival with two platters of sizzling steaks. The two waited silently as dishes and silverware were exchanged. Once the waiter left, Joan spoke up, “So what about your end of the deal? Anything new on this Friar de Almagro?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry’s voice was subdued. “No… I’m still waiting to hear back from the archbishop’s people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “When I was working on the metal, I got to thinking about the Dominican cross you found. I was wondering if it was really gold, or maybe another amalgam like the debris in the skull.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-19.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
