The ladies at the Senior Center would soon fix that. These halls got downright chilly, especially during Cedar Cove’s damp winters. How sad that this man didn’t have anyone who cared enough about his welfare to see that he had a basic comfort like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be back soon,” she told him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom nodded and gave her a rakish little grin. Oh, yes, he’d been a charmer in his day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked out the main door, Janet stopped her. “Did you introduce yourself to Tom Harding?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did. What a dear man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you’d think so. You’re exactly what he needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t have any family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no next of kin listed in his file. It’s about five years since his stroke, and apparently he’s never had visitors.” She paused, frowning. “But then, I don’t know how much we can trust the record-keeping at Senior Haven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long was he there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet shrugged. “I don’t recall exactly. At least five years. After he was released from chronic care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, the poor man. He’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In need of a friend,” Janet finished for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he found one,” Charlotte said. She’d always been a talker. Clyde used to say she could make friends with a brick wall. He meant it as a compliment and she’d taken it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn second thought, she wouldn’t ask the women at the Senior Center to knit Tom a lap robe; she’d do it herself, just as soon as she finished the baby blanket. By her next visit, she’d have something to give him, something to keep him warm—the lap robe…and her friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Olivia Lockhart had a difficult time with divorce cases, which were her least favorite duty in family court. She’d served on the bench for two years and figured she’d seen it all. Then there were cases like this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan and Cecilia Randall were asking to rescind their handwritten notarized prenuptial agreement. As soon as that was out of the way, they would file for the dissolution of their marriage. The attorneys stood before her with their clients at their sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia glanced at the paperwork, noting that it had been dated and signed less than a year ago. How a marriage could go so wrong so quickly was beyond her. She looked up and studied the couple. So young, they were, both of them staring down at their feet. Ian Randall seemed to be a responsible young man, probably away from his home and family for the first time, serving in the military. The wife was a fragile waif, impossibly thin with dark, soulful eyes. Her straight brown hair framed her heart-shaped face; the ends straggled to her shoulders. She repeatedly looped a strand around her ear, probably out of nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must say this is original,” Olivia murmured, rereading the few lines of the text. It was straightforward enough if unusual. According to the agreement, the spouse who filed for divorce would assume all debts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently they’d had a change of heart in that, as well as in the matter of their marriage. Olivia glanced over the brief list of accumulated debts and saw that they’d been evenly split between the couple. If the marriage had lasted longer, of course, the debts would have been more punishing—a mortgage, presumably, car payments and so on. Which would have provided the discontented spouse with an incentive of sorts to stay in the marriage, Olivia supposed. In any event, the current debts amounted to seven thousand dollars. Ian Randall assumed all credit card bills and Cecilia Randall had agreed to pay the utility bills, which included a three-hundred-dollar phone bill and oddly enough, a two-hundred-dollar charge to a florist shop. The largest of the debts, she noticed, was burial costs, which they had agreed to share equally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both parties have reached an agreement in regard to all debts accumulated during the time of their marriage,” Allan Harris stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly there was more to this situation than met the eye. “Was there a death in the family?” she asked, directing the question to the attorney who’d spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllan nodded. “A child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia’s stomach spasmed. “I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our daughter was born premature, and she had a defective heart,” Cecilia Randall said in a barely audible voice. “Her name was Allison.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allison Marie Randall,” the sailor husband added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia watched as husband and wife exchanged glances. Cecilia looked away but not fast enough for Olivia to miss the pain, the anger, the heartache. Perhaps she recognized it because she’d experienced it herself, right along with the disintegration of her own marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two parties continued to await her decision. Since everything was in order and both were in agreement, there was little to hold up the procedure. This hearing was simply a formality so they could proceed to the dissolution of their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seven thousand dollars is quite a lot of debt to accumulate in just a few months,” she said, prolonging their wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree, Your Honor,” Brad Dumas inserted quickly, “but there were extenuating circumstances.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia caught sight of her mother in the viewing chamber. She often sat in the front row, almost always occupied with her needles and yarn. But Charlotte wasn’t knitting now. Her fingers clenched the needles that rested in her lap, as though she, too, understood the significance of what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia hesitated, which was completely unlike her. She was known for being swift and decisive. What this couple needed was a gentle, loving hand to guide them through the grieving process. Ending their marriage wouldn’t solve the problems; personal experience had taught Olivia that. If the Randalls insisted on going through with their divorce, Olivia would be helping them pave a one-way road to pain and guilt. However, she had no legal reason not to rescind the agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to take a ten-minute recess…to review this agreement,” she announced. Then, before the members of either party could reveal their shock, she got up and headed toward her chambers. She heard the rustle of the courtroom as everyone stood, followed by a flurry of hushed whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting at her desk, Olivia leaned her head against the high-back leather chair and closed her eyes. It was inevitable that she’d see the comparisons between herself and Cecilia Randall. Fifteen years ago, Olivia had lost her oldest son. All those years had come and gone, but the pain of Jordan’s death had never faded, and it never would. In the twelve months after the drowning accident, her entire world had crumbled. First she’d lost her son and then her husband. Over the years, small problems had crept into her marriage—nothing big, nothing overwhelming or unusual, just the typical stress experienced by any couple with dual careers and three demanding children. But after Jordan’s death, that stress had multiplied tenfold, had become insurmountable. Before Olivia could fully appreciate what they were doing, they’d separated. Not long afterward, Olivia and Stan found themselves standing in front of a judge, and the divorce was declared final.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree months later, Stan had shocked her and everyone else by remarrying. Apparently he’d been confiding his problems to this other woman for some time, keeping the relationship a secret from Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded at her door and before Olivia could answer, her mother let herself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia straightened. She should’ve known her mother would take this opportunity to speak with her. “Hello, Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not disturbing you, am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia shook her head. Her mother knew the door was always open as far as she was concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, good.” Charlotte immediately got to the point—her point. “What a shame it is, that young couple wanting out of their marriage when they’ve barely had a chance to get to know each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was thinking the same thing, although she couldn’t and wouldn’t admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems to me that neither of them is very keen on this divorce. I could be wrong, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother, you know I can’t discuss my cases.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, I know, but sometimes I just can’t help myself.” Charlotte started to back out the door, then apparently changed her mind. “I don’t know if I ever told you this, but your father and I didn’t get along the first year, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was news to Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clyde was a stubborn man, and as you might have noticed I have a strong will of my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was an understatement if ever there was one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our first year, all we did was argue,” Charlotte said. “And then, before I knew it, I was pregnant with your brother and well…well, we worked everything out. We had a lot of good years together, your father and I.” Her hands tightened around her purse and her knitting bag. “He was the love of my life.” As if she’d said more than she’d intended, Charlotte moved out of the room and gently closed the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Olivia got to her feet. Leave it to her mother to say exactly what she needed to hear. Her decision made, Olivia returned to the courtroom. Once she was seated, the Randalls and their attorneys approached the bench. Cecilia Randall stepped forward with her big, soulful eyes staring blankly into space. Ian Randall’s expression was hard and unflinching, as though he was preparing himself for the inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot discount the possibility,” Olivia began, “that these parties entered into this agreement in contemplation of the very issue—this matter of divorce—that is set before this court. They obviously placed great value on their marriage and that value served as consideration for such a contract. Their intent was clearly to avoid the outcome they now seem to be pursuing—an easy divorce. Therefore, I am not setting aside the prenuptial agreement. The issue will need to be resolved at trial. In the meantime, I strongly urge these parties to seek out counseling or apply to the Dispute Resolution Center to discuss their differences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth spouses and their lawyers leaned closer, as if they couldn’t possibly have heard correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllan Harris and Brad Dumas immediately started shuffling through their notes. The sight was almost comical as the two attorneys hurried to reread the prenuptial agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, Your Honor.” Brad Dumas reacted first, raising his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both parties are in agreement,” Allan Harris argued. “Mr. Randall has agreed to set aside the prenuptial and has willingly taken on responsibility for a share of the debts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did she say?” Cecilia Randall asked, looking to Allan Harris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To clarify, Your Honor,” Brad Dumas requested, his expression puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The agreement stands as written,” Olivia stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not setting aside the agreement?” Allan Harris spoke slowly. He sounded confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Counselors, I am not, for the reasons I’ve just indicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllan Harris and Brad Dumas stared at her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/16-lighthouse-road-cedar-cove-1/page-3.html","bookId":1941,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:42 AM"}
