He\u0027s part of your Spirit River.\" Leto pressed the knife hard against Muriz\u0027s robe. \"Careful, Muriz.\" Leto lifted his left hand, released the Fremen\u0027s face flap, dropped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing what Leto planned, Muriz said: \"Where would you go if you killed us both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to Jacurutu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto pressed the fleshy part of his own thumb against Muriz\u0027s mouth. \"Bite and drink, Muriz. That or die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz hesitated, then bit viciously into Leto\u0027s flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto watched the man\u0027s throat, saw the swallowing convulsion, withdrew the knife and returned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wadquiyas,\" Leto said. \"I must offend the tribe before you can take my water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pistol is over there.\" Leto gestured with his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trust me now?\" Muriz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How else can I live with the Cast Out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Leto saw the sly look in Muriz\u0027s eyes, but this time it was a measuring thing, a weighing of economics. The man turned away with an abruptness which told of secret decisions, recovered his maula pistol and returned to the wing step. \"Come,\" he said. \"We tarry too long in a worm\u0027s lair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe future of prescience cannot always be locked into the rules of the past. The threads of existence tangle according to many unknown laws. Prescient future insists on its own rules. It will not conform to the ordering of the Zensunni nor to the ordering of science. Prescience builds a relative integrity. It demands the work of this instant, always warning that you cannot weave every thread into the fabric of the past. -Kalima: The Words of Muad\u0027Dib, The Shuloch Commentary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz brought the ornithopter in over Shuloch with a practiced ease. Leto, seated beside him, felt the armed presence of Behaleth behind them. Everything went on trust now and the narrow thread of his vision to which he clung. If that failed, Allahu akbahr. Sometimes one had to submit to a greater order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butte of Shuloch was impressive in this desert. Its unmarked presence here spoke of many bribes and many deaths, of many friends in high places. Leto could see at Shuloch\u0027s heart a cliff-walled pan with interfringing blind canyons leading down into it. A thick growth of shadescale and salt bushes lined the lower edges of these canyons with an inner ring of fan palms, indicating the water riches of this place. Crude buildings of greenbush and spice-fiber had been built out from the fan palms. The buildings were green buttons scattered on the sand. There would live the cast out of the Cast Out, those who could go no lower except into death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz landed in the pan near the base of one of the canyons. A single structure stood on the sand directly ahead of the \u0027thopter: a thatch of desert vines and bejato leaves, all lined with heat-fused spice-fabric. It was the living replica of the first crude stilltents and it spoke of degradation for some who lived in Shuloch. Leto knew the place would leak moisture and would be full of night-biters from the nearby growth. So this was how his father lived. And poor Sabiha. Here would be her punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Muriz\u0027s order Leto let himself out of the \u0027thopter, jumped down to the sand, and strode toward the hut. He could see many people working farther toward the canyon among the palms. They looked tattered, poor, and the fact that they barely glanced at him or at the \u0027thopter said much of the oppression here. Leto could see the rock lip of a qanat beyond the workers, and there was no mistaking the sense of moisture in this air: open water. Passing the hut, Leto saw it was as crude as he\u0027d expected. He pressed on to the qanat, peered down and saw the swirl of predator fish in the dark flow. The workers, avoiding his eyes, went on with clearing sand away from the line of rock openings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz came up behind Leto, said: \"You stand on the boundary between fish and worm. Each of these canyons has its worm. This qanat has been opened and we will remove the fish presently to attract sandtrout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Leto said. \"Holding pens. You sell sandtrout and worms off-planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s suggestion!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But none of your worms or sandtrout survive for long away from Dune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Muriz said. \"But someday...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in ten thousand years,\" Leto said. And he turned to watch the turmoil on Muriz\u0027s face. Questions flowed there like the water in the qanat. Could this son of Muad\u0027Dib really read the future? Some still believed Muad\u0027Dib had done it, but... How could a thing such as this be judged?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently Muriz turned away, led them back to the hut. He opened the crude doorseal, motioned for Leto to enter. There was a spice-oil lamp burning against the far wall and a small figure squatted beneath it, back to the door. The burning oil gave off a heavy fragrance of cinnamon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve sent down a new captive to care for Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s sietch,\" Muriz sneered. \"If she serves well, she may keep her water for a time. \"He confronted Leto. \"Some think it evil to take such water. Those lace-shirt Fremen now make rubbish heaps in their new towns! Rubbish heaps! When has Dune ever before seen rubbish heaps! When we get such as this one -\" He gestured toward the figure by the lamp. \"- they\u0027re usually half wild with fear, lost to their own kind and never accepted by true Fremen. Do you understand me, Leto-Batigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you.\" The crouching figure had not moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak of leading us,\" Muriz said. \"Fremen are led by men who\u0027ve been blooded. What could you lead us in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kralizec,\" Leto said, keeping his attention on the crouched figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz glared at him, brows contracted over his indigo eyes. Kralizec? That wasn\u0027t merely war or revolution; that was the Typhoon Struggle. It was a word from the furthermost Fremen legends: the battle at the end of the universe. Kralizec?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall Fremen swallowed convulsively. This sprat was as unpredictable as a city dandy! Muriz turned to the squatting figure. \"Woman! Liban wahid!\" he commanded. Bring us the spicedrink!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. \"Do as he says, Sabiha,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped to her feet, whirling. She stared at him, unable to take her gaze from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know this one?\" Muriz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is Namri\u0027s niece. She offended Jacurutu and they have sent her to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Namri? But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liban wahid,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rushed past them, tore herself through the doorseal and they heard the sound of her running feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She will not go far,\" Muriz said. He touched a finger to the side of his nose. \"A kin of Namri, eh. Interesting. What did she do to offend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She allowed me to escape.\" Leto turned then and followed Sabiha. He found her standing at the edge of the qanat. Leto moved up beside her and looked down at the water. There were birds in the nearby fan palms and he heard their calls, their wings. The workers made scraping sounds as they moved sand. Still he did as Sabiha did, looking down, deep into the water and its reflections. The corners of his eyes saw blue parakeets in the palm fronds. One flew across the qanat and he saw it reflected in a silver swirl of fish, all run together as though birds and predators swam in the same firmament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabiha cleared her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hate me,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shamed me. You shamed me before my people. They held an Isnad and sent me here to lose my water. All because of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz laughed from close behind them. \"And now you see, Leto-Batigh, that our Spirit River has many tributaries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my water flows in your veins,\" Leto said, turning. \"That is no tributary. Sabiha is the fate of my vision and I follow her. I fled across the desert to find my future here in Shuloch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and...\" He pointed at Sabiha, threw his head back in laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will not be as either of you might believe,\" Leto said. \"Remember this, Muriz. I have found the footprints of my worm.\" He felt tears swimming in his eyes then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He gives water to the dead,\" Sabiha whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Muriz stared at him in awe. Fremen never cried unless it was the most profound gift of the soul. Almost embarrassed, Muriz closed his mouthseal, pulled his djeballa hood low over his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto peered beyond the man, said: \"Here in Shuloch they still pray for dew at the desert\u0027s edge. Go, Muriz, and pray for Kralizec. I promise you it will come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFremen speech implies great concision, a precise sense of expression. It is immersed in the illusion of absolutes. Its assumptions are a fertile ground for absolutist religions. Furthermore, Fremen are fond of moralizing. They confront the terrifying instability of all things with institutionalized statements. They say: \"We know there is no summa of all attainable knowledge; that is the preserve of God. But whatever men can learn, men can contain.\" Out of this knife-edged approach to the universe they carve a fantastic belief in signs and omens and in their own destiny. This is an origin of their Kralizec legend: the war at the end of the universe. -Bene Gesserit Private Reports/folio 800881\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have him securely in a safe place,\" Namri said, smiling across the square stone room at Gurney Halleck. \"You may report this to your friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is this safe place?\" Halleck asked. He didn\u0027t like Namri\u0027s tone, felt constrained by Jessica\u0027s orders. Damn the witch! Her explanations made no sense except the warning about what could happen if Leto failed to master his terrible memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a safe place,\" Namri said. \"That\u0027s all I\u0027m permitted to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a distrans. Sabiha is with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sabiha! She\u0027ll just let him -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s no longer up to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck grimaced. Distrans. What was the range of those damned cave bats? He\u0027d often seen them flitting across the desert with hidden messages imprinted upon their squeaking calls. But how far would they go on this hellhole planet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must see him for myself,\" Halleck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not permitted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck took a deep breath to quiet himself. He had spent two days and two nights waiting for search reports. Now it was another morning and he felt his role dissolving around him, leaving him naked. He had never liked command anyway. Command always waited while others did the interesting and dangerous things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why isn\u0027t it permitted?\" he asked. The smugglers who\u0027d arranged this safe-sietch had left too many questions unanswered and he wanted no more of the same from Namri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some believe you saw too much when you saw this sietch,\" Namri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck heard the menace, relaxed into the easy stance of the trained fighter, hand near but not on his knife. He longed for a shield, but that had been ruled out by its effect on the worms, its short life in the presence of storm-generated static charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This secrecy isn\u0027t part of our agreement,\" Halleck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d killed him, would that have been part of our agreement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Halleck felt the jockeying of unseen forces about which the Lady Jessica hadn\u0027t warned him. This damned plan of hers! Maybe it was right not to trust the Bene Gesserit. Immediately, he felt disloyal. She\u0027d explained the problem, and he\u0027d come into her plan with the expectation that it, like all plans, would need adjustments later. This wasn\u0027t any Bene Gesserit; this was Jessica of the Atreides who\u0027d never been other than friend and supporter to him. Without her, he knew he\u0027d have been adrift in a universe more dangerous than the one he now inhabited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t answer my question,\" Namri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were to kill him only if he showed himself to be... possessed,\" Halleck said. \"Abomination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamri put his fist beside his right ear. \"Your Lady knew we had tests for such. Wise of her to leave that judgment in my hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck compressed his lips in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard the Reverend Mother\u0027s words to me,\" Namri said. \"We Fremen understand such women but you off-worlders never understand them. Fremen women often send their sons to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck spoke past still lips. \"Are you telling me you\u0027ve killed him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lives. He is in a safe place. He\u0027ll continue to receive the spice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m to escort him back to his grandmother if he survives,\" Halleck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamri merely shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck understood that this was all the answer he\u0027d get. Damn! He couldn\u0027t go back to Jessica with such unanswered questions! He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why question what you cannot change?\" Namri asked. \"You\u0027re being well paid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck scowled at the man. Fremen! They believed all foreigners were influenced primarily by money. But Namri was speaking more than Fremen prejudice. Other forces were at work here and that was obvious to one who\u0027d been trained in observation by a Bene Gesserit. This whole thing had the smell of a feint within a feint within a feint...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting to the insultingly familiar form, Halleck said: \"The Lady Jessica will be wrathful. She could send cohorts against -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zanadiq!\" Namri cursed. \"You office messenger! You stand outside the Mohalata! I take pleasure in possessing your water for the Noble People!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck rested a hand on his knife, readied his left sleeve where he\u0027d prepared a small surprise for attackers. \"I see no water spilled here,\" he said. \"Perhaps you\u0027re blinded by your pride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live because I wished you to learn before dying that your Lady Jessica will not send cohorts against anyone. You are not to be lured quietly into the Huanui, off-world scum. I am of the Noble People, and you -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m just a servant of the Atreides,\" Halleck said, voice mild. \"We\u0027re the scum who lifted the Harkonnen yoke from your smelly neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamri showed white teeth in a grimace. \"Your Lady is prisoner on Salusa Secundus. The notes you thought were from her came from her daughter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy extreme effort, Halleck managed to keep his voice even. \"No matter. Alia will...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamri drew his crysknife. \"What do you know of the Womb of Heaven? I am her servant, you male whore. I do her bidding when I take your water!\" And he lunged across the room with foolhardy directness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck, not allowing himself to be tricked by such seeming clumsiness, flicked up the left arm of his robe, releasing the extra length of heavy fabric he\u0027d had sewn there, letting that take Namri\u0027s knife. In the same movement, Halleck swept the folds of cloth over Namri\u0027s head, came in under and through the cloth with his own knife aimed directly for the face. He felt the point bite home as Namri\u0027s body hit him with a hard surface of metal armor beneath the robe. The Fremen emitted one outraged squeal, jerked backward, and fell. He lay there, blood gushing from his mouth as his eyes glared at Halleck then slowly dulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck blew air through his lips. How could that fool Namri have expected anyone to miss the presence of armor beneath a robe? Halleck addressed the corpse as he recovered the trick sleeve, wiped his knife and sheathed it. \"How did you think we Atreides servants were trained, fool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath thinking: Well now. Whose feint am I? There\u0027d been the ring of truth in Namri\u0027s words. Jessica a prisoner of the Corrinos and Alia working her own devious schemes. Jessica herself had warned of many contingencies with Alia as enemy, but had not predicted herself as prisoner. He had his orders to obey, though. First there was the necessity of getting away from this place. Luckily one robed Fremen looked much like another. He rolled Namri\u0027s body into a corner, threw cushions over it, moved a rug to cover the blood. When it was done, Halleck adjusted the nose and mouth tubes of his stillsuit, brought up the mask as one would in preparing for the desert, pulled the hood of his robe forward and went out into the long passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe innocent move without care, he thought, setting his pace at an easy saunter. He felt curiously free, as though he\u0027d moved out of danger, not into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never did like her plan for the boy, he thought. And I\u0027ll tell her so if I see her. If. Because if Namri spoke the truth, the most dangerous alternate plan went into effect. Alia wouldn\u0027t let him live long if she caught him, but there was always Stilgar - a good Fremen with a good Fremen\u0027s superstitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica had explained it: \"There\u0027s a very thin layer of civilized behavior over Stilgar\u0027s original nature. And here\u0027s how you take that layer off him...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit of Muad\u0027Dib is more than words, more than the letter of the Law which arises in his name. Muad\u0027Dib must always be that inner outrage against the complacently powerful, against the charlatans and the dogmatic fanatics. It is that inner outrage which must have its say because Muad\u0027Dib taught us one thing above all others: that humans can endure only in a fraternity of social justice. -The Fedaykin Compact\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto sat with his back against the wall of the hut, his attention on Sabiha, watching the threads of his vision unroll. She had prepared the coffee and set it aside. Now she squatted across from him stirring his evening meal. It was a gruel redolent with melange. Her hands moved quickly with the ladle and liquid indigo stained the sides of his bowl. She bent her thin face over the bowl, blending in the concentrate. The crude membrane which made a stilltent of the hut had been patched with lighter material directly behind her, and this formed a grey halo against which her shadow danced in the flickering light of the cooking flame and the single lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat lamp intrigued Leto. These people of Shuloch were profligate with spice-oil: a lamp, not a glowglobe. They kept slave outcasts within their walls in the fashion told by the most ancient Fremen traditions. Yet they employed ornithopters and the latest spice harvesters. They were a crude mixture of ancient and modern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabiha pushed the bowl of gruel toward him, extinguished the cooking flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto ignored the bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be punished if you do not eat this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, thinking: If I kill her, that\u0027ll shatter one vision. If I tell her Muriz\u0027s plans, that\u0027ll shatter another vision. If I wait here for my father, this vision-thread will become a mighty rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind sorted the threads. Some held a sweetness which haunted him. One future with Sabiha carried alluring reality within his prescient awareness. It threatened to block out all others until he followed it out to its ending agonies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you stare at me that way?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill he did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the bowl closer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto tried to swallow in a dry throat. The impulse to kill Sabiha welled in him. He found himself trembling with it. How easy it would be to shatter one vision and let the wildness run free!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muriz commands this,\" she said, touching the bowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Muriz commanded it. Superstition conquered everything. Muriz wanted a vision cast for him to read. He was an ancient savage asking the witch doctor to throw the ox bones and interpret their sprawl. Muriz had taken his captive\u0027s stillsuit \"as a simple precaution.\" There\u0027d been a sly jibe at Namri and Sabiha in that comment. Only fools let a prisoner escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz had a deep emotional problem, though: the Spirit River. The captive\u0027s water flowed in Muriz\u0027s veins. Muriz sought a sign that would permit him to hold a threat of death over Leto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike father, like son, Leto thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The spice will only give you visions,\" Sabiha said. The long silences made her uneasy. \"I\u0027ve had visions in the orgy many times. They don\u0027t mean anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it! he thought, his body locking itself into a stillness which left his skin cold and clammy. The Bene Gesserit training took over his consciousness, a pinpoint illumination which fanned out beyond him to throw the blazoning light of vision upon Sabiha and all of her Cast Out fellows. The ancient Bene Gesserit learning was explicit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Languages build up to reflect specializations in a way of life. Each specialization may be recognized by its words, by its assumptions and sentence structures. Look for stoppages. Specializations represent places where life is being stopped, where the movement is dammed up and frozen.\" He saw Sabiha then as a vision-maker in her own right, and every other human carried the same power. Yet she was disdainful of her spice-orgy visions. They caused disquiet and, therefore, must be put aside, forgotten deliberately. Her people prayed to Shai-Hulud because the worm dominated many of their visions. They prayed for dew at the desert\u0027s edge because moisture limited their lives. Yet they wallowed in spice wealth and lured sandtrout to open qanats. Sabiha fed him prescient visions with a casual callousness, yet within her words he saw the illuminated signals: she depended upon absolutes, sought finite limits, and all because she couldn\u0027t handle the rigors of terrible decisions which touched her own flesh. She clung to her one-eyed vision of the universe, englobing and time-freezing as it might be, because the alternatives terrified her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, Leto felt the pure movement of himself. He was a membrane collecting infinite dimensions and, because he saw those dimensions, he could make the terrible decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my father did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must eat this!\" Sabiha said, her voice petulant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto saw the whole pattern of the visions now and knew the thread he must follow. My skin is not my own. He stood, pulling his robe around him. It felt strange against his flesh with no stillsuit protecting his body. His feet were bare upon the fused spice-fabric of the floor, feeling the sand tracked in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you doing?\" Sabiha demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The air is bad in here. I\u0027m going outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t escape,\" she said. \"Every canyon has its worm. If you go beyond the qanat, the worms will sense you by your moisture. These captive worms are very alert - not like the ones in the desert at all. Besides -\" how gloating her voice became! \"- you\u0027ve no stillsuit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you worry?\" he asked, wondering if he might yet provoke a real reaction from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027ve not eaten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll be punished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m already saturated with spice,\" he said. \"Every moment is a vision.\" He gestured with a bare foot at the bowl. \"Pour that onto the sand. Who\u0027ll know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They watch,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, shedding her from his visions, feeling new freedom envelop him. No need to kill this poor pawn. She danced to other music, not even knowing the steps, believing that she might yet share the power which lured the hungry pirates of Shuloch and Jacurutu. Leto went to the doorseal, put a hand upon it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Muriz comes,\" she said, \"he\u0027ll be very angry with -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muriz is a merchant of emptiness,\" Leto said. \"My aunt has drained him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got to her feet. \"I\u0027m going out with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought: She remembers how I escaped her. Now she feels the fragility of her hold upon me. Her visions stir within her. But she would not listen to those visions. She had but to reflect: How could he outwit a captive worm in its narrow canyon? How could he live in the Tanzerouft without stillsuit or Fremkit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must be alone to consult my visions,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll remain here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the qanat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sandtrout come out in swarms at night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t eat me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes the worm comes down to just beyond the water,\" she said. \"If you cross the qanat...\" She broke off, trying to edge her words with menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could I mount a worm without hooks?\" he asked, wondering if she still could salvage some bit of her visions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you eat when you return?\" she asked, squatting once more by the bowl recovering the ladle and stirring the indigo broth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything in its own time,\" he said, knowing she\u0027d be unable to detect his delicate use of Voice, the way he insinuated his own desires into her decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muriz will come and see if you\u0027ve had a vision,\" she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will deal with Muriz in my own way,\" he said, noting how heavy and slow her movements had become. The pattern of all Fremen lent itself naturally into the way he guided her now. Fremen were people of extraordinary energy at sunrise but a deep and lethargic melancholy often overcame them at nightfall. Already she wanted to sink into sleep and dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto let himself out into the night alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky glittered with stars and he could make out the bulk of surrounding butte against their pattern. He went up under the palms to the qanat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-26.html","bookId":2155,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:50 PM"}
