Alec is much, much nicer than you. He actually smiles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sign the damned things so we can get out of here.\" Kristoff growled, indicating the two copies of marriage forms he\u0027d produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had discovered he\u0027d spoken the truth about the elderly clergyman. Not only was he deaf to all pleas to save me, he performed what I had a horrible feeling was a marriage ceremony while I tried to reason with the insane man next to me. \"This is ridiculous. This is 2008. You can\u0027t force someone to get married. There are laws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are also bribes, and as I spent the night getting the correct documents and asking my old friend here to conduct the official ceremony, it will be completely legal and binding. As soon as you sign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re in Iceland! I\u0027m not a citizen. Surely it can\u0027t be legal for noncitizens to be married without a ton of paperwork. And don\u0027t I have to be present to get a license? Surely I have to have been present!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are ways to make it possible,\" he said grimly. \"Sign the damned things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, folding my hands. \"And you can\u0027t make me. Kill me if you want, but I\u0027m not signing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff snarled something rude that I chose to ignore, yanking a small blue object from his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Where did you get that?\" I tried to grab my passport back from him, but he held it out of reach, flipping through the pages until he came to the one with my signature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your precious Alec gave it to me last night, when you were asleep,\" he said, snatching up the pen and thrusting it into my hand. Before I could throw it away he yanked me backward against his body, one hand clamping down on mine as he consulted the passport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" I yelled, struggling as he forced my hand to write a scraggly version of my name. \"This isn\u0027t legal! You can\u0027t do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s done,\" he snapped, forcing me to sign the second form before releasing me. I jumped away and rubbed my abused hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have witnesses, Mr. Smarty-Pants,\" I pointed out. \"You may have your buddy there falsely conduct the ceremony, and you may have a version of my signature, but there were no witnesses to the ceremony, and I\u0027m sure that even in Iceland you have to have witnesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff put two fingers to his mouth and blew a piercing whistle that seemed earsplitting in the confined space of the small church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men emerged from what I assumed was a back room. They both eyed me as they came forward, speaking in a language that I didn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do either of you speak English?\" I asked sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one on the left is my brother Andreas. The other is my cousin Rowan,\" Kristoff said, almost smirking at my look of consternation. \"They both speak a dozen languages, English included.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand itched to slap that look off his face, but I hung on to my temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose it would do any good to tell you that your brother is insane?\" I asked the man named Andreas. There wasn\u0027t a lot of family resemblance, although he, too, was the sort of man who made women stop and stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more so than any one of us,\" Andreas answered, then signed the forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sank as the second man did the same. The three of them spoke quietly for a few minutes while I contemplated my choices. I\u0027d run for it, except Kristoff retained a hold on my arm, not to mention the fact that I wouldn\u0027t stand a chance of outrunning any one of the men present - other than the priest, and even he looked unusually spry for someone his age, laughing at something that the vampire named Rowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat thought struck me oddly, somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have... you know... fangs?\" I asked Kristoff, making a little fangy gesture with my fingers. \"Like Dracula fangs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three men all stared at me as if I\u0027d just turned into a giant ice-skating sloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t, then? So the whole fang thing is a myth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look of disbelief on Kristoff\u0027s face was almost worth the experience of being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan burst into laughter. Andreas frowned, saying something in what sounded to me like Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I\u0027m normally a pretty circumspect person,\" I told Andreas. \"But since I woke up this morning, I\u0027ve found a murdered woman in my bathroom, run away from the police, been kidnapped by a vampire, and been forced to participate in a pretend wedding, so what inhibitions I normally hold are pretty much gone. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll excuse me if I say that it\u0027s very rude to speak in a language that not everyone can understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan laughed even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndreas\u0027s frown darkened for a moment, then he suddenly smiled. Although his face wasn\u0027t nearly as hard as Kristoff\u0027s, his smile was just as chilling. \"I told my brother that he should have simply killed you rather than wed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not married,\" I said, crossing my arms over my chest in a show of what I hoped looked like bravado. Surrounded as I was by three tall, extremely handsome bloodsucking fiends, I certainly felt anything but brave, but it wouldn\u0027t do to let them know that. \"It wasn\u0027t a legal ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men looked inquiringly at Kristoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a bitter look. \"It was entirely legal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not! I didn\u0027t understand anything that priest said, let alone agree to it! He could have been performing the last rites for all I know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I can arrange for that, if you like,\" Kristoff said with smooth menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my chin. I may not be the bravest of women, but I hate being bullied. \"You didn\u0027t even kiss me. Weddings always end in a kiss. So there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence filled the church for a moment before Kristoff made a low noise deep in his chest and yanked me toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you growling at me - ?\" I just had time to say before he kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind, never the most reliable of organs in times of stress, shut down and left me flailing in Kristoff\u0027s arms. This was not the same sort of kiss that Alec had pressed all over me the night before - this was a kiss of aggression, a punishment, an invasion. He didn\u0027t even wait for me to invite him in, his tongue was there, inside my mouth, sweeping around as if it owned the place. Not even Alec had kissed me so intimately!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved hard on Kristoff\u0027s chest and jerked out of his grip, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. \"If you ever do that again, so help me god, I\u0027ll... I\u0027ll... I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do, but you can bet your butt it\u0027ll be horrible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The marriage is legal,\" Kristoff said, shoving one of the signed sheets into my hands. His eyes glowed from within, looking oddly lighter than I remembered them. \"Complete with kiss. Tell that to your reaper friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to tell him that they weren\u0027t necessarily my friends, but he didn\u0027t wait around for me to answer. He just turned on his heel and marched out of the church. I stared in surprise for a few moments before I turned to the other two vamps. They watched me with eyes filled with malice and suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left,\" I said, too surprised to care that I was stating the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you even think of using your powers against him, I guarantee that you will pay in ways you cannot imagine,\" Andreas threatened before he, too, marched out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan said nothing, just gave me a long, hard look, shoved me aside, and left as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good riddance!\" I yelled after them, going to the door to watch as two cars backed out and sped off up the winding road. It was at that moment that I realized I was stranded, alone, without money, identification, or even a clear knowledge of the name of the town in which I\u0027d been dumped. \"Hey? Anyone? I don\u0027t have a car. Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back to the clergyman, but he\u0027d disappeared as well, leaving me standing on a windy cliff, outside of a cold, dank little stone church, clutching a marriage certificate that I knew was false... but I had a horrible suspicion no one else would see it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Married to a vampire,\" I said out loud, the words whipped away on the wind. \"Oh, joy. Now what am I going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you know the way to Ostri?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head and stared with absolutely no surprise at the translucent figure that stood there. I raised an eyebrow at the spectral horse next to him, but I didn\u0027t say one word about the fact that yet another ghost had descended upon me. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m new around here. You\u0027re... er... dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you can see.\" The man, who was dressed in what looked to be Victorian wear, frowned. \"You\u0027re the reaper and you don\u0027t know where Ostri is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid not, but since I\u0027m evidently now the ghostly information office, I guess I\u0027d better find out. What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ulfur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do? I\u0027m Pia, and yes, I\u0027m the Zorya.\" I held up my hand. The moonstone had once again converted itself into a small lantern. \"But I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m new to the job, and don\u0027t know all the ins and outs of the whole thing yet. So you\u0027ll have to join the others while you wait for me to figure out what\u0027s what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three other ghosts. They\u0027re back in town. I don\u0027t suppose you have a magical way of transporting us there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pursed his lips and eyed me curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? I didn\u0027t think so. Well, I guess we\u0027d better go see if there\u0027s a bus or something. You can come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the others?\" Ulfur asked, falling into step with me as I started to pick my way down the rocky hillside to the fishing village below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you - they\u0027re back in town. I think. I didn\u0027t actually see them when I left them, but that could be because Anniki had the stone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I meant the others here.\" He waved toward the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cautiously moved over to the edge of the cliff and looked down. Along the craggy shoreline, a group of about twelve ghosts roamed aimlessly. They looked up as I stood staring down in increasing despair. More ghosts. Just what I needed to complicate things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the reaper,\" Ulfur bellowed down to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted a wan hand and waved back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all ghosts?\" I asked Ulfur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and patted his horse\u0027s head. \"Landslide. Wiped out half the village. I had been in college in Reykjavik but came home for my father\u0027s birthday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch. You speak English really well,\" I said, curious about that fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUlfur smiled. \"There is not much to do with our time but watch and listen to people. A company runs tours from here to local fjords, so we get lots of tourists. It provides us all with an excellent means of learning other languages. English was the first we learned, and now that the Japanese tours have started, we\u0027re hoping to learn that language next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it would provide for entertainment.\" I thought for a moment. \"Maybe you\u0027d all better stay here until I can figure out how to get you to heaven. Er... Ostri. Whichever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that we\u0027re safe staying here,\" he said, his face becoming serious. \"An Ilargi has been seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of those bad-reaper, soul-eater guys?\" A little shiver zipped down my back. \"They don\u0027t sound good at all. Well, I guess you\u0027ll all have to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and bellowed out orders to the folks below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked out at the sea, bluey grey and wind tossed, and wondered what on earth I was going to do now. \"Could my life get any stranger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the wind and the mournful cry of gulls wheeling overhead were the only answer to my question. I took one last look at the sea, then gestured to the waiting ghosts below and pointed to the village. A faint hurrahing cry met my ears as I jammed my hands in my pockets and started down the path into the village, Ulfur and his horse on my heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat on earth had I gotten myself into? And more importantly, how was I going to get out of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the better part of the day to get back to Dalkafjordhur. I didn\u0027t want to encounter the police, so I took the only bus that ran from the fishing village, praying the police wouldn\u0027t stop people going into town. There was a bit of a tussle when the driver found out I didn\u0027t have the fare, but I succeeded in returning to Dalkafjordhur by dint of clinging with desperate stubbornness to the railing on the back of one of the seats. Since none of the five passengers on the bus spoke English - or wanted to get involved - I don\u0027t quite know what threats the driver was using, but in the end he gave up trying to root me out, and let me ride without further harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUlfur, his horse, and the twelve other ghosts didn\u0027t raise a single complaint, but that\u0027s only because no one but me saw them. The ghosts were all polite, however, men, women, and children dressed in clothing from a hundred and fifty years before, all of them pathetically grateful I was taking them under my wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t guarantee anything, but I suppose there\u0027s safety in numbers,\" I told them after the bus driver, giving up on me, drove us up the track to the main road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman who was seated near me gave me an odd look from the corner of her eye. I smiled at her but didn\u0027t have the energy to try to explain that there was, at that moment, a ghost sitting in her lap, while a horse nosed her bag on the ground beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the reaper,\" an elderly male ghost said, nodding at Ulfur. \"He says you will take us to Ostri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the idea,\" I said, gnawing on my lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shot me another look, then got up and took a seat closer to the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mulled over my options on what ended up being an hour-long drive into town. I didn\u0027t have the faintest idea how to help the ghosts, but the Brotherhood people at the church must know something about it. Clearly, I\u0027d have to go to them to get specifics. Maybe one of them could even take over and lead all the ghosts on to their reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheered by that thought, I sat back and tried to think positively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of a police car slowly patrolling the streets of the town as we approached ended that happy mood. Wary of being caught in a police cordon, I got out at the first stop, taking a good twenty minutes to carefully make my way through as many backstreets and alleys as I could find, a parade of ghosts trailing after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" one of the ghosts, a petulant-looking teenage girl, asked in a grating, whiny voice. \"Are we going to have to walk all the way to Ostri?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn older woman shushed her with an anxious glance my way. \"Do not speak so to the reaper. She will show us the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we hope,\" I muttered. The sun was low in the sky, sending long, inky shadows from the buildings, making the alleyways particularly dim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept an eye peeled for any tour members who might suddenly spot me and set up a hue and cry, but the streets were bare of lonely American tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a good thing, too,\" I said as I cut behind a row of buildings to avoid a busy intersection. \"All we need now is to run into someone I kno - oof!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark shape loomed up out of nowhere, as hard as brick, and a million times scarier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeal blue eyes glowed at me from the depths of the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked, too annoyed at having been dumped without a ride to be frightened of Kristoff. Behind me, the ghosts gathered. Ulfur\u0027s horse whinnied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s he?\" the elderly male ghost asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I think she knows him, though,\" Ulfur answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, not that it\u0027s here nor there,\" I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff\u0027s eyebrows rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. Talking to my ghosts.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes. \"Ghosts, plural?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Thirteen of them. Fourteen if you count the horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff was silent for the count of ten. \"Where\u0027s Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands on my hips, more than a little peeved. \"Do you seriously think I\u0027d be skulking around back alleys with a herd of ghosts if he was with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he was going to find you. He hasn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I glared at Kristoff as he emerged from the shadows, taking care to avoid the dim patch of sunlight that filtered down through the buildings. I hesitated, feeling unsure of what my emotions were with regard to Alec. I had a whole lot of questions to ask him, starting with Anniki and working down to why he had skipped out, leaving me alone without a word. \"You spoke to him, then? Did he say anything about Anniki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! It\u0027s a Dark One!\" Ulfur said behind me. There was a murmur of agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s ever so handsome. He can bite me any day,\" the whiny girl said. I shot her a look. She smirked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is there to say?\" Kristoff answered, his scowl truly world-class. \"I suppose I will have to take you to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to sound so disgusted,\" I snapped, my pride stung yet again by the fact that he obviously disliked me intensely. \"It\u0027s not like I have cooties or anything! And just for the record, I don\u0027t like you very much, either. You\u0027re not at all what a vampire should be like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat took him aback for a few seconds. \"And just what do you think a Dark One should be like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sexy! Like Angel and those guys in the vampire movies. Well, except the bun-head version, but that wasn\u0027t meant to be sexy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m attractive?\" he asked, an odd expression flickering across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do!\" the teen ghost said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored her and made a big show of examining Kristoff from head to foot. If I thought he had been eye candy before, he definitely improved with nearness. His hair was sort of a chestnut reddish brown, with curls that looked as soft as satin. His face was hard, as I\u0027ve noted, but it was a hard beauty, with a cleft chin that somehow kept drawing my eye. Like Alec, he was several inches taller than me, but where Alec was bulky with heavy muscles, Kristoff possessed a leaner frame that reminded me somehow of a big cat, like a lion or panther. I ignored the breadth of his chest, telling myself that Alec\u0027s was just as broad. His legs were longer, however, and filled out his faded jeans in a manner that left me admiring his obviously muscled thighs. I had a sudden urge to go peek at his behind, but quickly squelched that. The ghosts, I had a feeling, would never let me hear the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attractive?\" I gave a little nonchalant laugh that sounded awfully strained. \"No, not at all. Not in the least. That dead rat over there exudes more sexual attraction than you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she blind?\" I heard the girl ask someone else. \"Or just stupid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, child, and let the reaper alone,\" the older woman answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, miss, you let him have it,\" another ghostly woman spoke up. \"Don\u0027t do to let your man think as he can speak to you like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not my - \" I stopped before I said anything more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff just stood there and looked at me with those uncanny eyes, making me squirm a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right, I\u0027m lying like hell. Yes, you\u0027re very attractive, the kind of sexy that makes women want to rip off their underwear and throw themselves on you. Happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even blink, just stared at me for a second or two. \"You mean as you did last night in the park?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks burned at the memory. I glanced behind me. The ghosts were all gathered together in a half circle, watching me with interest. Even the horse seemed to be waiting to see what I\u0027d say next. \"That was a different situation entirely. And I had my undies on, thank you! Regardless of your god-amongst-men status, I don\u0027t like you. You have insulted me, deliberately intimidated me, and tried to make me feel guilty about something that is not my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darkened. I swear to god, the teal color darkened a couple of shades. I watched in fascination as the black spikes from the pupils seemed to elongate and fill the iris. \"When have I insulted you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words snapped me back from a reverie about how bad men so often had such pretty eyes. \"What? Oh. When haven\u0027t you insulted me? You wanted to kill me last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I wanted you dead, you\u0027d be dead,\" he said in an even tone. That scared me more than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh,\" one of the ghosts said as there was a general intake of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well... that aside, you told me you\u0027d rather marry a viper than me,\" I told Kristoff, incensed enough that I didn\u0027t care if I was arguing in front of an audience or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips tightened. \"You didn\u0027t want to marry me, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re married?\" the teen asked in a sulky voice. \"That just isn\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course I didn\u0027t want to marry you, and still don\u0027t. I don\u0027t know you, let alone have those sorts of emotions for you that usually end up in a marriage. And there\u0027s the little fact that you\u0027re an evil vampire, and I\u0027m evidently one of the good guys, so this whole Romeo-and-Juliet scenario isn\u0027t going to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a couple of steps closer to me, his glare menacing. \"If you think I harbor romantic illusions about a mere legal convenience, I urge you to rethink. I am not Romeo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghosts forgotten in my ire, I took a step toward him, the toes of my shoes just a hairsbreadth from his as I leveled him a look that told him I wasn\u0027t the fool he took me for. \"With the implication, I suppose, that I\u0027m no Juliet? Well, thank you, you don\u0027t need to point that out any more than you do the fact that you don\u0027t like that Alec and I spent the night together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bluish fire flared to life in his eyes as he leaned in toward me. \"Don\u0027t like it? Are you implying I\u0027m jealous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I said, gathering up my tattered shreds of dignity. \"I\u0027m no stranger to the mirror, and you\u0027ve made it quite clear you not only think I\u0027m physically repulsive, but that Alec is crazy for not having the same taste as you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" he asked, his eyes narrowing. \"I did not say you were repulsive, and I don\u0027t give a damn who Alec sleeps with. His personal life is no business of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Alec?\" I heard whispered behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh! I think they\u0027re just getting to the good part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t actually say the word \u0027repulsive,\u0027 no, but you implied that just looking at me sickens you,\" I said, suddenly feeling like crying. Why did I care that he thought I was a frumpy, overweight hussy? \"You can\u0027t deny that the only reason you kissed me is because I made you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I deny it.\" He leaned even closer until I could feel his breath. \"No one can make me do anything against my will. No one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the fact that I couldn\u0027t seem to get enough breath into my lungs and gave him a cool look. \"Oh, really? So you did want to marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I was willing to do whatever it took to keep you from gaining the full powers of a Zorya, and I meant it,\" he answered, his voice low and gritty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air seemed to heat up several degrees in the alleyway. \"That would imply that you did want to kiss me,\" I said, having to clear my throat a couple of times before I could speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze dropped to my mouth, and I was suddenly aware of a most appalling fact - I wanted him to kiss me. Right then, right there, in front of the ghosts and anyone else who wandered by. I wanted to feel his mouth on mine, and taste him again, and rub myself against him in a wholly foreign manner. But worst of all, I wanted him to force me into a kiss so that I could pretend to myself that I didn\u0027t want it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShame and disgust tumbled around with confusion and indecision inside me. How could I sleep with one man, and the next day be wanting to kiss his evil friend? What was wrong with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been adverse to kissing mortals,\" Kristoff said in his deep, unusually sexy voice. I shivered a little despite the sudden heat that was making me very aware of the clothing binding my skin. \"And I don\u0027t find you repulsive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said, my brain giving up any attempt at sanity and settling down to providing my mouth with really insipid things to say. \"Good. You\u0027re not repulsive, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear his eyes lightened then. They went from teal blue to a light robin\u0027s egg blue, the black flares from his pupils even darker. I took a deep breath at his nearness, wondering why I could feel air going into my lungs, but still felt light-headed and breathless. My breasts rubbed against the soft leather of his jacket, the sensation making me shiver again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you think so.\" His lips brushed mine, just the lightest of touches, more a little bump than a kiss, but with it, I finally came to my senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a harlot,\" I yelled, grabbing two fistfuls of his jacket and shaking them. \"I do not sleep with a man one day, and kiss the living daylights out of his friend the next, no matter how much I want to. I\u0027m not that sort of girl! You\u0027re bad. You\u0027re evil. You\u0027re a vampire, dammit! But you\u0027re no Angel, and I\u0027m no Buffy, and you can just stop making me confused about everything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA puzzled look was followed by a quick spike of anger in his eyes, and then he was kissing me, really kissing me, with his lips and tongue and his hands in my hair, and I lost it all again. His tongue twined around mine in an erotic, sinuous dance that made me aware of all sorts of suddenly erogenous spots on my body. I rubbed my breasts into him, allowing him to taste me, savoring the sensation of his body so hard and hot and utterly masculine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a good thing he was holding on to me, because my legs started to go weak under the effect of that kiss. By the time he pulled back, I was gasping for breath, stunned with the intensity of emotions that seemed to spring from him, but which I unaccountably shared. I stared up at him in unadulterated amazement, not sure what to make of anything anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were the pale blue of an icy lake. \"The discussion of which of us is truly evil will have to wait for another time. You are not safe here. The mundane police are looking for you, and a number of reapers live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back, my face red with embarrassment at his words. I\u0027d become my worst nightmare - a pushy, shameless woman. What must he think of me? I all but seduced him in an alleyway, for god\u0027s sake, right in front of a gaggle of ghosts, the very day after I\u0027d spent the night with his buddy. I lifted my chin and tried to regain my composure. \"I figured the police would be looking for me. I\u0027m not afraid of the Brotherhood people, though. I know you have issues with them, but they don\u0027t pose me any threat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t they?\" The faintest hint of a smile showed on his damned lips. I dragged my gaze up from them and gave myself a mental lecture about morality. \"What do you think they\u0027re going to do when they find out their precious Zorya is married to a Dark One?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"If the Zorya has to marry one of their own people, as you say, they aren\u0027t going to be happy, but they\u0027re hardly going to do anything to me other than take away the stone and make someone else Zorya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not how it works,\" he said, his face hard and unyielding. Even as I marveled that I had wanted so badly to kiss him, the desire to do the same welled up inside me. I squashed it down mercilessly. \"In their eyes, you have been tainted by your marriage to me. The only way they can have a new Zorya is by the elimination of the old one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him in growing comprehension. \"You mean they\u0027d kill me to get a new Zorya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" Ulfur said. \"That doesn\u0027t sound good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are wed to me,\" Kristoff said evenly, his face unreadable. \"You cannot assume the full powers of a Zorya now, and thus you are useless to their purpose. It will be for Alec to keep you safe so that they cannot name a new one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you,\" I told him, trying to convince myself that he was lying. To be honest, I wasn\u0027t sure he was, but something didn\u0027t ring true. I just didn\u0027t know what was what anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"That\u0027s Alec\u0027s problem. He\u0027ll deal with you now. I\u0027ve done my part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not something to be dealt with, although I would appreciate talking to him,\" I said with as much dignity as I could muster. Which, given that I had just been sucking on his tongue, wasn\u0027t a whole lot. \"As it is, I have a few questions for - look out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree shadows rose up behind Kristoff, shadows that quickly resolved themselves into figures. It was a faint flicker of light off a long blade that had caught my eye. Kristoff slammed his hand into my chest, sending me crashing backward into a large stack of wooden crates. I hit my head hard on the wood, but by the time my vision cleared, I realized that he wasn\u0027t assaulting me, he had merely shoved me out of the way while he dealt with the attackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd deal with them he did. I had no idea where he carried the twin daggers that now flashed in his hands, but he whirled and attacked with incredible grace and power, sending two of the three men flying in opposite directions. One of them crashed at my feet. I snatched up an empty crate and brought it down on his head as he was about to rise, feeling immense satisfaction as the man collapsed unconscious to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghosts leaped around, yelling and calling advice, unable to interact with anything, their ghostly forms adding just another level of surreality to the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff\u0027s fight with the other two men was over almost as quickly, increasing my respect for his prowess. One man he sent slamming into the nearest wall, which was enough to send the attacker sliding uselessly to the ground, where he lay in a motionless blob. The last man, the one wielding a sword, screamed something at Kristoff, and slashed at him with rhythmic strokes of the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff parried them all, kicking out with one leg, catching the man square in the chest, which sent him, too, slamming against the wall. I was just about to cheer when suddenly I was yanked painfully backward by my hair, a burning sensation at my throat. The man I\u0027d hit with the crate snarled obscenities as he dragged me backward, toward the other end of the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch me and she dies,\" he spat out, then gave as obscene a laugh as I\u0027d ever heard, and continued in a foreign language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t kill our reaper, can he?\" the elderly ghost asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Ulfur said hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ll happen to us if he does? The Ilargi will get us!\" the teen wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squirmed, trying to get a purchase on the ground so I could twist out of my attacker\u0027s grip, but he kept me too much off balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff said nothing, just stalked toward us, his eyes as black as midnight. I shivered at the sight, understanding now what Anniki had said about the vampires. Kristoff wasn\u0027t human. He was something foreign, something dark and dangerous, and every instinct I possessed told me to get away before he caught me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed, my voice abruptly stopping when my captor wrapped his hand tighter in my hair before jerking me sideways into the brick wall. I saw stars again as pain burst out in red waves that left me nauseous and nearly unconscious. I grasped for something to keep me from falling into a deep, dark pit where I seemed to teeter at the edge, my fingers closing around a cold metal rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir moved past me as my eyes slowly cleared, leaving me with a clear vision of Kristoff calmly wiping a bloodied dagger blade on the prone form that lay at my feet. I clutched the trash bin with all my strength, staring in horror at the body. Although my attacker had fallen facedown, I knew without a doubt that he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Kristoff had killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight there in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I needed any proof that what Anniki had said was the real version of what was going on, this was definitely it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked into Kristoff\u0027s now smoky blue eyes and saw the rage he felt, saw fury and menace and triumphant victory. I was up and running down the alley away from him before I even knew my legs would still work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoices called out my name, one of them his, but I ran even faster, blindly careening off of walls and obstructions and even cars as I dashed madly through the city, sure of only one thing - Kristoff was a killer. Alec couldn\u0027t be like him. Could he? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zen-and-the-art-of-vampires-dark-ones-6/page-6.html","bookId":2207,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:50 PM"}
