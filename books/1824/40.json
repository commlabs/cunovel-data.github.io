It can get pretty brutal, which I love. I played a lot of rugby growing up, but if I can\u0027t find a game, I go to the nearest batting cages and hit baseballs until I wind down. Frustration is another matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? How do you get rid of frustration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimple was back. \"Sex.\" He saw the instant blush and had to laugh again. \"What do you do when you\u0027re frustrated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t bring herself to tell him that when her frustration grew, she wrote code. No, she couldn\u0027t tell him that because it was such a nerdy thing to admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing,\" she said with a straight face. She lowered her eyes and asked, \"Tell me, Liam, are you frustrated now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her a long minute before answering, \"You\u0027re playing with fire. It doesn\u0027t matter how frustrated I am. This is work and you\u0027re an asset. I don\u0027t have sex with assets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel her cheeks burning. Flirting wasn\u0027t her forte, and she should never have tried being coy. \"I was not asking you to have sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late she realized she should have kept her voice low. Half the restaurant had heard her. A rather good-looking man wearing a Celtics T-shirt at the end of the bar yelled, \"I\u0027ll have sex with you, honey, anytime, anyplace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buried her face in her hands. \"Oh God,\" she groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second man at the bar, pointing to the two on either side of him, chimed in, \"Forget these guys. They\u0027re amateurs. I\u0027m the man you want, sweet cheeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she raised her head and glanced around the room, a dozen people were looking at her and laughing. She was mortified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam took mercy on her. \"Want to change the subject?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blocked out the faces that were staring at her and straightened in her chair, focusing on Liam. \"Do you like basketball?\" she blurted. \"I do. I love the Celtics, and if I were going to stay in Boston, I would get on the list for season tickets. Good ones are hard to come by,\" she rattled on. \"And baseball. I love baseball, too. I go to a lot of the Red Sox home games.\" She stopped because she had to take a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to take you to the batting cages one of these days,\" Liam remarked. He was trying not to laugh at her, because she was so uncomfortable. Her face was still red. Such an innocent, he thought. There wasn\u0027t anything phony or pretentious about her. Yet another reason he was drawn to her. She definitely was unusual compared to the other women he\u0027d known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was an asset and off-limits, he reminded himself once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finally getting past her embarrassment. \"I can go to the batting cages by myself. Besides, you won\u0027t be in town long enough to take me. Remember? After I do that little favor for you, you\u0027re out of here. Isn\u0027t that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like being reminded that he would be leaving. \"Right,\" he said, his voice clipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly remembered a question she wanted to ask. \"Why did you come to my house tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to call you, and your number was disconnected. I came to find out what was going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you saw me leaving with my bag, did you think I was trying to escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, Allison. There\u0027s no place you could go that I wouldn\u0027t find you,\" he said with a confident smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to Jordan\u0027s house. I just needed to get away,\" she said. \"I changed my phone number because of my aunt. On the way back from Emerson, she called at least twenty-five times. I\u0027m not exaggerating,\" she insisted. \"I knew she wouldn\u0027t stop harassing me, so I changed my number. I\u0027m only giving it to a few trusted friends, and you, of course,\" she added hastily. \"I\u0027ll give you my new number now if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised, she said, \"You what? You have it? I only just changed it.\" She shook her head. \"If you want something you just . . . get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much.\" The waiter appeared with the tab, and after paying, Liam stood. \"Are you ready to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered, and even though there had been awkward, even embarrassing moments, she hated to see her evening with Liam end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they crossed the restaurant, he put his arm around her and pulled her into his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" she asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-40.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
