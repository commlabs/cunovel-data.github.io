She felt as though she had been jabbed with a pin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe afternoon sun was shining in her face and its dazzle made her blink. She lowered the shade and simultaneously bent to look at Walter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a little surprised to find his eyes open. This wasn\u0027t one of his waking periods. She looked at her wrist watch. No, it wasn\u0027t. And it was a good hour before feeding time, too. She followed the demand-feeding system or the \"if-you-want-it-holler-and-you\u0027ll-get-it\" routine, but ordinarily Walter followed the clock quite conscientiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkled her nose at him. \"Hungry, duckie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter did not respond at all and Laura was disappointed. She would have liked to have him smile. Actually, she wanted him to laugh and throw his pudgy arms about her neck and nuzzle her and say, \"Mommie,\" but she knew he couldn\u0027t do any of that. But he could smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a light finger to his chin and tapped it a bit. \"Goo-goo-goo-goo.\" He always smiled when you did that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he only blinked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I hope he isn\u0027t sick.\" She looked at Mrs. Ellis in distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Ells put down a magazine. \"Is anything wrong, my dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Walter just lies there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor little thing. He\u0027s tired, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t he be sleeping, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in strange surroundings. He\u0027s probably wondering what it\u0027s all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose, stepped across the aisle, and leaned across Laura to bring her own face close to Walter\u0027s. \"You\u0027re wondering what\u0027s going on, you tiny little snookums. Yes, you are. You\u0027re saying, \"Where\u0027s my nice little crib and all my nice little funnies on the wall paper?\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she made little squeaking sounds at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter turned his eyes away from his mother and watched Mrs. Ellis somberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Ellis straightened suddenly and looked pained. She put a hand to her head for a moment and murmured, \"Goodness! The queerest pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he\u0027s hungry?\" asked Laura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord,\" said Mrs. Ellis, the trouble in her face fading, \"they let you know when they\u0027re hungry soon enough. There\u0027s nothing wrong with him. I\u0027ve had three children, my dear. I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll ask the stewardess to warm up another bottle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if it will make you feel better...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stewardess brought the bottle and Laura lifted Walter out of his bassinette. She said, \"You have your bottle and then I\u0027ll change you and then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe adjusted his head in the crook of her elbow, leaned over to peck him quickly on the cheek, then cradled him close to her body as she brought the bottle to his lips-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter screamed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth yawned open, his arms pushed before him with his fingers spread wide, his whole body as stiff and hard as though in tetany, and he screamed. It rang through the whole compartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura screamed too. She dropped the bottle and it smashed whitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Ellis jumped up. Half a dozen others did. Mr. Ellis snapped out of a light doze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Mrs. Ellis blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know.\" Laura was shaking Walter frantically, putting him over her shoulder, patting his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, baby, don\u0027t cry. Baby, what\u0027s the matter? Baby-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stewardess was dashing down the aisle. Her foot came within an inch of the cube that sat beneath Laura\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter was threshing about furiously now, yelling with calliope intensity. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-30.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
