They stood with their sidearms halfway out of their holsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn calmly shot each man, once in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly dropped outside the door, rolled inside, her weapon leveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security system,\" John whispered to her and Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred and Linda appeared a moment later, and together they pulled and wedged the heavy door back into its twisted frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All good outside,\" Fred told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sat before the bank of monitors and pulled out a touch pad, booting the ONI computer infiltration software package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt tapped on the keyboard, nodding to the sticky note under one monitor. \"Password\u0027s posted,\" he said, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Kelly muttered. \"We can do it the easy way, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning monitor-looping protocol, now. I\u0027ll get a clean path to the target.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt meanwhile flipped through various camera angles and subsystems on the displays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No alarms raised,\" he reported. He paused and watched a group of guards unloading ammunition canisters off a Warthog. One man fumbled and dropped a can; along its side was stenciled: MUTA-AP-09334.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn hadn\u0027t ordered a subsystems sweep, though he hadn\u0027t specifically forbidden it, either. Kurt\u0027s actions could trigger a red flag at the base\u0027s command and control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had mixed feelings about using SPARTAN-051, Kurt, as Sam\u0027s replacement on Blue Team. On the one hand, he was an extremely capable Spartan. Chief Mendez had routinely given him command of Green Team during training exercises, and Kurt had often won when facing John\u0027s Blue Team. But on the other hand, he was, for a Spartan, undisciplined. He took time to talk with every Spartan, and even the non-Spartan personnel that trained and supplied them. As a professional soldier in the middle of two wars—one fighting an entrenched rebellion, the other taking on a technologically superior xenophobic alien race—Kurt spent a considerable amount of time and energy making friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Camera system and detectors looped,\" Kelly announced and made a tiny circle with her index finger. \"We have fifteen minutes while dogs and drones are rotated and refueled. So just guards to deal with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move,\" John told his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt hesitated, eyes still fixed on the monitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" John asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A funny feeling,\" Kurt whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis worried John. Everyone had performed flawlessly, and there were no signs the enemy had reacted to their presence. But Kurt had a reputation for sniffing out ambushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had been on the receiving end of Kurt\u0027s intuition several times during training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded at the monitor, still devoid of anything but normal activity. \"Explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guards unloading that Warthog,\" Kurt said. \"They look like… they\u0027re getting ready for something. Security systems and machines can be fooled—or easily rigged to fool,\" he stated. \"People? They\u0027re not so easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" John said. \"We\u0027ll stay sharp, but we have to stick to the schedule. Let\u0027s move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt got up, casting a glance back at the monitor as they exited the gatehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans melted from shadow to shadow, skirting around a warehouse, under officers\u0027 barracks, and finally, at the center of the base, they approached the edge of a warehouse. The building was surrounded by three fences posted with warnings that the gravel yard beyond was mined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight guards patrolled the perimeter. Parked on the side was a modified Warthog; it had been cut in half and a new midsection had been welded in place that looked like it could carry ten men into battle. It would suffice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn withdrew a tiny rod and pointed it at the building. The radiation counter flickered to a hundred times normal background level for this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat confirmed that their primary target was inside: three FENRIS nuclear warheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent battles with the Covenant had depleted UNSC stockpiles of fissile materials in this sector to almost nothing. Insurgents had heard of this (which indicated they also had a considerable intelligence capability), and they had contacted the regional CENTCOM to boldly offer a trade. They said they had stolen warheads. They claimed to have people with Borren\u0027s Syndrome, and wanted the expertise and medicines only UNSC doctors could provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCENTCOM said they\u0027d consider the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had considered it, and sent in Blue Team to get those warheads, and if presented with the opportunity, they were to target any rebel leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn signaled his team to move out, disperse around the bunker, and take up positions to snipe the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen acknowledgment lights winked on. Kurt\u0027s was last, with a palpable hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn gave Kurt a short hand wave, and then pointed at the Warthog, indicating that he get the vehicle ready to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt\u0027s \"feeling\" that something was wrong was contagious. John didn\u0027t like it. He pushed his uncertainties aside. Blue Team was in position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn unslung his sniper rifle and sighted. He gave the \"go\" signal and watched as one guard and then another silently fell over. Linda had been quick and efficient as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn gave the go-ahead to move in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Team eased inside, sweeping the dark corners of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was empty, save steel racks cradling three conical warhead casings. John\u0027s radiation counter jumped, indicating that they did not hold conventional explosives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at Kelly and Fred, to the rack, then to the Warthog outside. They nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt\u0027s acknowledgment light winked red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Spartan flashed a red light on a mission unless they had a good reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abort,\" John said. \"Back out. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDizziness washed over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn saw Linda, Fred, and Kelly sink to their knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen blackness swallowed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn awoke with a start. Every muscle burned and it felt like someone had hammered his head. This was a good sign: it meant he wasn\u0027t dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed his muscles against an unyielding pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked to clear his hazy vision and saw he sat propped against a wall, still in the high-security bunker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warheads were also still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen John saw a dozen commandos in the warehouse, watching him. They hefted the .30-caliber machine gun, favored by rebel forces. Nicknamed \"confetti makers,\" they were grossly inaccurate, but at point-blank range, it would hardly be a concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of Blue Team lay face-first on the concrete floor. Technicians in lab coats crouched over them capturing high-resolution digital video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn jerked against his inert armor. He had to get to his team. Were they dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to struggle,\" a voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man with long gray hair stepped in front of John\u0027s faceplate. \"Or struggle if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve installed neural-inhibitor collars on you and your comrades. UNSC standard issue for dangerous felons.\" He smiled. \"I\u0027d wager without one you could, and would, rip me in half in that miraculous power armor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn kept his mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" the man said. \"I am General Graves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn recognized the name. Howard Graves was one of the three men believed to be in charge of the united rebel front. It was no coincidence he was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re suffering from rapid decompression—the bends,\" he told John. \"We used an antigrav plate, old technology that never panned out, but for our purposes, it worked just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA focused beam fooled your armor\u0027s sensors into thinking you were in a ten-gee environment. It increased internal pressure to save your lives, momentarily rendering you unconscious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You engineered this all for us,\" John said, his voice hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You \u0027Spartans\u0027 have put quite a dent in our efforts to liberate the frontier worlds,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Graves said. \"Station Jefferson in the Eridanus asteroid belt last year; our destroyer Origami; six months ago, our high-explosive manufacturing facility; followed by the incident in Micronesia, and our saboteur cell on Reach. I didn\u0027t believe it until I saw the video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll by the same four-man team. Some said \u0027Blue Team\u0027 was a myth.\" He rapped his knuckle on John\u0027s faceplate. \"You seem real enough to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn struggled, but he might as well have been encased in a mountain of steel. The neural collar neutralized every signal traveling down his spine save the autonomics to his heart and diaphragm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to focus. Did everyone on his team have a collar? Yes. Each Spartan had a thick clamp on the back of their neck, directly over the AI interface port. Graves had excellent intelligence on their equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. John scrutinized his paralyzed team: Kelly, Linda, and Fred. No Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves had said \"four-man team.\" He didn\u0027t know about Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you surmised,\" Graves continued, \"this was all for your benefit. We scraped our fissile material together and made sure it was done so sloppily that even your Office of Naval Intelligence saw it happen. We anticipated the miraculous Blue Team would be sent. I am not disappointed that your leaders\u0027 minds are still so easily read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young commando approached, saluted, and nervously whispered, \"Sir, external sensors are off-line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves frowned. \"Drag the prisoners out of here. Sound the general alarm. Police those warheads, and tell the liftships to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA buzzing sound filled the air. John spied a blur of spinning metal through the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a fraction of a second to see it was an eight-armed Asteroidea antipersonnel mine, its pressure trigger jammed with a chunk of gravel—just before it detonated into a ball of thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetal pinged off John\u0027s armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone standing in the room doubled over from the con-cussive force and hail of shrapnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix commandos with multiple cuts and bleeding ears rose, weapons ready, shaking their heads to clear the disorientation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modified Warthog that had been parked next to the bunker crashed into the open double doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire warehouse shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commandos opened fire, and rushed the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warthog pulled away, then with a squeal, it reversed, and then rammed the doorway again. The corrugated steel walls screeched, buckled, and with a shower of sparks the vehicle wedged its midsection in the building like a pregnant queen termite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commandos unloaded their confetti makers, puckering the \u0027Hog\u0027s armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top of the midsection slid open and three more Aster-oidea antipersonnel mines arced, whirling like a child\u0027s toy— each landing in a corner of the bunker—and exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-hot metal fragments cut through the commandos like a scythe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt leapt out and shot the three men still moving. He quickly went to each Spartan and pulled off the collars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly rolled to her feet. Fred and Linda got up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt yanked the collar off John\u0027s neck. His entire body tingled, but his muscles once again responded to his commands. He flexed his limbs. There was no permanent nerve damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can forget about stealth now,\" John said. \"Kurt, drive the Warthog. Kelly, Linda, Fred, get those warheads loaded ASAP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn went to General Graves. A sliver of corrugated steel had lodged in the man\u0027s skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunate. Graves had held secrets of the rebels\u0027 command and intelligence structure- secrets John had had the barest glimpse of. Their capacities had been greatly underestimated. With the larger Covenant threat looming, John wondered what the rebels would ultimately do. Attack a weakened UNSC as it battled aliens, or fight against humanity\u0027s common enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored the larger strategic picture and focused on the tactical, helping Kelly maneuver the last warhead into the Warthog\u0027s armored midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoaded with the bombs and five armored Spartans, the vehicle bottomed its shocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn climbed into the rear and Kurt drove, and they sluggishly accelerated away from the secure warehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best speed to the PZ,\" John ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt turned on the Warthog\u0027s radio. It buzzed with confused chatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unit One nonresponsive. Gunfire reported. Man down! Tracking APC. Open fire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfirm— confirm! All units converge. Do it now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone,\" John shouted, \"into the center.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoles peppered the Warthog, armor-piecing rounds penetrating the side like paper and denting the casings of the warheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behind the warheads!\" Fred told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn, Kelly, Fred, and Linda huddled behind the missiles. Nuclear warheads ironically would provide their best defense. Their casings were superhardened, both to contain radiation and hold the fury of a small sun for a split second longer and to boost the thermonuclear yield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn looked up at the driver\u0027s seat. Kurt squeezed himself lower into the seat, presenting the smallest possible target, risking his life to get them all to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warthog billowed smoke, but its speed slowly increased to forty kilometers an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp rattle came from the engine. A tire shredded and the vehicle swerved right and then left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt regained control and kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AP fire slowed and then stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brace!\" Kurt said and downshifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warthog barreled through the chain-link and concertina-wire barrier, over gravel fields, and into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Road 32-B to the PZ,\" Kurt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Road\" was a creative overstatement. They bounced along, mowing down trees, fishtailing, and spraying mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drones!\" Kurt told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the hatch open,\" John ordered. Kelly and Fred pulled the midsection roof panels apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn stuck his head out, and spotted three MAKO-class attack drones jetting toward them, each heavy with a fat missile. One direct hit would take out the Warthog. Even a near miss could destroy an axle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda popped up, her sniper rifle already in hand and eyes on the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn and Linda opened fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lead drone smoked and dropped into the trees. The next drone angled up, bobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt released its missile, and banked away. A line of smoke appeared, a tail of fire, and a missile accelerated toward them at a frightening rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda fired, squeezing off the rounds as fast as the chamber could cycle. The missile started to spin… but it was still dead on course. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-3.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
