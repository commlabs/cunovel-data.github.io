kinsfolk betrayed to his death with a kiss!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had I but time—had I respite—well might I wail for this!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Never was murder compassed so with villainy fraught,”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto the King said Siegfried, “as this that on me ye have wrought!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the day of your dread I saved you, I helped you in bitterest need:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for all my service rendered this is mine evil meed!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet again that death-stricken hero spake with an anguished moan:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If it be possible, Gunther, that to any on earth can be shown\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By thee true faith hereafter, let one be commended now,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My dear-loved wife, to thine honour as a king: protect her thou.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n May this for her profit avail her, that she is thy sister still.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By all the honour of princes, defend her thou from ill!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For me, for me shall my father and my liegemen tarry long.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ne’er from her nearest and dearest hath woman received such wrong!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Then writhed he in mortal sufferance: he gasped with hard-drawn breath;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he groaned from a heart sore anguished: “For this my murderous death\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through all your days hereafter shall ye bear the brand of Cain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Know me herein true prophet—your own selves have ye slain!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To right and to left were the flowers all drenched with the crimson flow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now hard with death is he wrestling, but short is the agony-throe,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the wound that the blade death-dealing had stricken was all too sore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the peerless knight and stainless shall never speak word more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they saw, those lords there standing, that the noble hero was dead,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They lifted him up, and they laid him on a golden buckler red.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 136}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then took they counsel together that the truth might be known unto none,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And how this thing should be hidden, that of Hagen the deed had been done.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake of them many: “Evil this day is, a day of bale!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Remaineth only concealment: ye needs must be all in a tale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We must say, as alone he was riding, robbers beset and slew\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The hero, the lord of Kriemhild, as he fared the wildwood through.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Hagen of Troneg: “To Rhineland will I bear him, even I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No whit shall it trouble Hagen, though she know all certainly,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That woman who dared flout Brunhild, and fill her heart with woe!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let her weep, let her do as she listeth—I shall reck of it little enow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Now as touching that selfsame fountain—if ye peradventure be fain\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To learn where welleth the water whereby was Siegfried slain—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the Odenwald’s fringe a village, hight Odenheim, doth lie:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Still floweth the stream—of a surety Siegfried died thereby.\n\u003c/div\u003e
