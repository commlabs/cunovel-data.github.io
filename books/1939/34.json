Physical exertion always helps me sort out my problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, however, it didn\u0027t work. All I could think about was Macy. How was she doing on her own with those cats of hers and Sammy? What about the old man? I shouldn\u0027t have left her. I should phone and make sure she was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy. Macy. Macy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name reverberated in my head with every step I took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no matter how fast I ran, I couldn\u0027t get her out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I did when I returned home, sweating and panting, was stumble toward the phone. I had her number written on a pad next to it and dialed, still gasping for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Macy?\" I asked, instantly alarmed that her neighbor was at the house this early. It was barely nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took off like a bat out of hell,\" Harvey said. \"What got into you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had an appointment,\" I lied. The truth was, I ran every Saturday and did consider it a standing appointment--with myself. Okay, I ran almost every Saturday. \"Let me talk to Macy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s taking a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the door open?\" Harvey\u0027s hearing wasn\u0027t that great and, if Macy passed out, it could be some time before he noticed and called for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately asked another question. \"Did she remember to cover her stitches so they wouldn\u0027t get wet?\" I\u0027d gone over the instructions with her last night, but she\u0027d been pretty much out of it and might have forgotten. I berated myself for not reviewing them this morning; I\u0027d been in too much of a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t shout at me,\" Harvey barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not shouting,\" I said, and I wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are, and furthermore I can only answer one question at a time. No, the bathroom door isn\u0027t open. I\u0027m not a voyeur!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She could pass out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy? She\u0027s not the type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t a type,\" I said, doing my best to remain calm. \"Macy got a hard knock to the head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re so worried about her, why did you leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I probably shouldn\u0027t have,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise Harvey laughed. \"She\u0027ll do that to you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say that again,\" I said, uncertain what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy,\" he told me. \"She wears you down. When she first moved here, I did everything I could to discourage her. I didn\u0027t need her to be my friend. I didn\u0027t want anything to do with her, wacky dame that she is. I built that fence for a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She overlooked every rebuff. I ignored her when she stopped by to visit. I didn\u0027t say a word, and you know what? I doubt she even noticed. She chattered away, talked about everything under the sun. If I told her to scat, she\u0027d disappear for a few minutes and then come back with something for me to eat. She\u0027d always say she got cranky when she was hungry, too. I doubt that girl\u0027s been cranky a day in her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the affection in his voice. This was an unusually long speech for Harvey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you feeling?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey snorted. \"Don\u0027t change the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to grow concerned about the old coot. He wanted to deal with death on his own terms, but that didn\u0027t mean it had to be painful--or happen any sooner than necessary. If I could steer him toward a physician, I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy\u0027s wearing you down, same as me,\" Harvey insisted. \"I can see it in your eyes. You\u0027re falling for her, and all I can say is God help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" I scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t say anything to her about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s she doing?\" I asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to keep her still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do your best,\" I told him and didn\u0027t envy him the task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You coming back or not?\" Harvey demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI briefly toyed with the idea and quickly decided against it. \"Not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey chuckled. \"Thought as much. Yup, I was right. She\u0027s got you wrapped around her little finger, just like she does me. Fight it all you want, but it\u0027s not going to do you a bit of good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could tell him how wrong he was, Harvey disconnected the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor half a second I was tempted to call back and argue with him. Fortunately, common sense took over and I walked away from the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stepped out of the shower, I felt refreshed. From this point forward, I was determined to avoid Macy and Harvey, too. She could finish the mural, I\u0027d pay her what I owed and I wouldn\u0027t see her again. That decision brought me a measure of relief. No woman who wasn\u0027t Hannah was going to dominate my thoughts. Especially one as reckless and unpredictable as Macy. I meant it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d agreed to pick up Leanne at six. Truthfully, I was grateful to have a reason to get out of the house. Two or three times during the day, despite keeping busy, I\u0027d felt the urge to check on Macy again. The woman was becoming a habit, an addiction I had to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne was ready when I got to her apartment. She opened the door and smiled at me. \"How\u0027s your injured friend?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better, thanks.\" I didn\u0027t want to go into details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, and I was reminded that she was an exceptionally lovely woman. I once again considered asking her to attend that awards dinner with me, but once again held off. It wasn\u0027t for a couple of weeks. There was no rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you picked out a movie?\" I asked. I was fine with whatever she chose. When Hannah was alive, we used to take turns choosing. I actually enjoyed a few \"chick flicks\" and she\u0027d sat through more than one techno-thriller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we should do that together,\" Leanne said. She had the paper spread out across the kitchen counter and we stood there and reviewed the listings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end we decided to watch a new movie that was being compared to last year\u0027s Academy Award winner. Neither of us had seen it and, frankly, I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d like it. Still, it was getting great reviews, so others must have found it entertaining and meaningful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suggested we attend the movie, then figure out what we wanted to do about dinner. At the theater, I purchased our tickets, after which I stood in a long line to get us a large buttered popcorn. As we sat through the movie, which took place in India, my mind drifted frequently as I contemplated giving up my medical practice and volunteering to serve in a third world country. The need was huge, I\u0027d tell myself, and then...then I\u0027d be pulled right back into the plot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned dinner as we strolled out of the multiplex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all that popcorn I couldn\u0027t eat a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d certainly gobbled my share and I wasn\u0027t hungry, either, but I didn\u0027t want the evening to end. However, spending time with Leanne wasn\u0027t the only reason. My fear was that once I got home, I wouldn\u0027t be able to resist calling Macy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about if we have a cup of coffee,\" Leanne said. \"I\u0027d like to hear what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think? About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...of course.\" I hadn\u0027t really formed an opinion. I hadn\u0027t watched it consistently or paid very careful attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe found a cafe that had outdoor seating and ordered cappuccinos, then made small talk until our coffees arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really enjoyed the film,\" Leanne said. \"I liked how they set everything up from the very first scene. You could feel the lead character\u0027s isolation and it foreshadowed where the story was going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, although I hadn\u0027t really been aware of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne was quite knowledgeable about story structure and plot. She spoke for several minutes, then stopped, looking embarrassed. \"Oh, Michael, I\u0027m so sorry,\" she murmured, staring down into her half-filled mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\" I repeated. \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For talking on and on like that and not giving you a chance to say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and squeezed her hand. \"I appreciated hearing your insights. If you hadn\u0027t mentioned it, I would never have noticed how well the various plotlines were connected. And I thoroughly enjoyed seeing you this animated.\" Unlike me, she was a pretty sophisticated filmgoer. Come to think of it, Hannah used to have insights like that, too. She\u0027d joked more than once that I only appreciated the gasoline explosions. Not true!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne exhaled and seemed relieved that I hadn\u0027t been offended. \"Mark and I used to watch a lot of movies together,\" she told me. \"He has an incredible memory for facts about actors, directors and producers. I used to try and stump him, but he always outdid me.\" She grew sad and lowered her eyes. \"I wonder if the army shows movies over in Afghanistan. Even if they do, I don\u0027t know if Mark would have access to them. Not that I\u0027d find out from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what to tell her, so I changed the subject and probably not with a lot of finesse. \"Hannah loved to cry at the movies.\" I never understood it. If the movie had a happy-ever-after ending, she\u0027d weep because she was happy. If some tragedy befell the protagonist, she could go through an entire wad of tissues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne smiled. \"That sounds like Hannah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she admitted. \"I\u0027m not much of a crier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked for a while longer; after an hour or so, we decided to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause our order was small, I left a generous tip for the waiter. I was about to suggest we take a stroll along the waterfront or ride the monorail to the Seattle Center, site of the 1962 World\u0027s Fair. That event had put Seattle on the map, my father had told me. Then Leanne yawned, a clear signal that she was ready to go home. I might not be able to decipher the finer points of a movie plot, but I could tell when a woman was eager for my company and when she wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked back to where I\u0027d parked the car and I opened her door. It was still light out, but at this time of year, the sun didn\u0027t set until almost nine-thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we were close to her complex, Leanne glanced at me and said, \"You don\u0027t need to walk me to my apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me just to drop you off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Don\u0027t go to any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, she wanted to make a quick escape. I\u0027d be lying if I said my ego hadn\u0027t taken a hit. It wasn\u0027t that I intended to invite myself in to spend the night, but it would\u0027ve been nice if she\u0027d shown some sign of having enjoyed our time together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The curb will be fine,\" she said next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne must have detected my disappointment be- cause she turned to look at me. \"Michael, oh, my goodness, I\u0027m being rude! Forgive me, please. Would you like to come up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s okay. I have things to do.\" Another lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe I was so thoughtless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leanne,\" I said, \"it\u0027s okay. Really.\" I was sincere about that. If I\u0027d accepted her invitation it would\u0027ve been for the wrong reasons. I\u0027d hoped to distract myself to avoid thinking about Macy. My motives weren\u0027t exactly pristine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled up to the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a wonderful time,\" Leanne said with a little too much enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get out of the car to open her door, but Leanne placed her hand on my arm and stopped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned back she offered me a soft smile, slipped her arms around my neck and kissed me. The kiss was lengthy and passionate, as if she was trying to prove how much she\u0027d enjoyed my company. When she finished I realized we\u0027d both been trying too hard to find something that just wasn\u0027t there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-34.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
