Later she’d talked him into dancing with her, even doing the YMCA dance. She had incriminating photos to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d made it her private mission to keep an eye on him during that event. She knew what it was to hunger for what one might never have. It gnawed, it ached. At a key moment, that hunger could break loose and result in very, very bad behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing back to the present, she studied her surroundings with narrowed eyes. Finding what she sought, she nodded to herself and pivoted toward the street, for the first time registering the limo and the man leaning against it, patiently waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered if Max had been standing there when she and Ben had her exchange at the door. Even if he’d still been sitting in the driver’s seat, he would have known from their body language things weren’t peachy. Max didn’t miss much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe K\u0026amp;A women joked about how much he looked like Peter, since he was Dana’s regular driver. Blond, gray-eyed, with lots of muscles that had been used in his previous work as a Navy Seal. Why he’d spent the past few years working for the company motor pool was a mystery, but they’d speculated about it. As well as a lot more inappropriate things about the handsome, quiet male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a pair of belted tan khakis and white shirt open at the throat, a jacket over that. She had no doubt he had a weapon underneath it. Always prepared, after all. He nodded to her as she approached. “Miss Marcie. Good to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You too.” It was a reflex answer as she handed him her bag and her shoes. The large fingers closing around the dainty straps would have amused her under normal circumstances, but right now, she had a different mission. Her hands now free, she turned around, headed back toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped off the path, smoothing her skirt modestly up under her thighs as she squatted. Selecting a handful of the smooth rocks that formed the mulch around the well-tended shrubs, she found they had a good weight and size in a woman’s palm. Aware of Max’s regard, she nevertheless ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving back onto the walkway, she backed up a sufficient number of steps, gauging her distance and studying her potential targets. Ben would have gone back upstairs. There was an office there, right off the bedroom. He preferred work when anything was aggravating him, and he’d made it clear she was an aggravation. His desk was close to that window. Perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ben.” Her throat had resigned itself to being abused, so it was settling into a kind of sexy, intense Lauren Bacall sound. She’d been able to hear the muted rush of passing cars in the bedroom, so the window insulation wasn’t soundproof. She was loud enough to be heard. “Here’s how reasonable adults react when they have feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first rock hit the upper office window dead on, breaking through with a satisfying shattering noise. The lower panel went next. She hoped she’d winged him, bounced the damn thing off his stubborn head. It would probably break the rock. Then she adjusted her stance and aimed for the bedroom window, where that amazing moment of connection had happened. When he’d lain upon her, looking down at her, her legs coiled over his hips, his hands on her face. She’d leave an explosion of broken glass so he’d have to strip the bed, get the linens washed or get splinters in his ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated when she lowered her gaze to the first level. Yeah, she could send a rock zinging through the wrought iron bars and take out door panels, but they were beautiful old stained glass. Some things were sacred. She targeted the living area windows instead, and used the last couple rocks for the other side, his dining room. Though she was standing about twenty feet away, she didn’t miss a single target. Before Jeremy had changed from her brother into an addict, he’d shown her how to throw a rock pretty damn well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was breathing a little erratically, but any desire to cry was gone. She was flat- out pissed, her blood on full boil. If he walked out that door, she wasn’t entirely sure another rock wouldn’t be aimed at his forehead as though a bull’s-eye was drawn there. But of course he wasn’t coming out. Stubborn bastard. No, worse than stubborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re too chickenshit to take me to a club,” she snarled up at the now fully aerated window treatments, “I will go by myself. Fuck you. How’s that for reasonable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, she knew better than to bluff Ben O’Callahan, but this time, she wasn’t sure it was a bluff. She was so mad, she was going to throw it out there. To thine own self be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to fall back, regroup, or she was going to prove herself an obsessed stalker after all. She’d climb through one of those windows and beat him to death. Nothing said love like a two-by-four applied to soft tissue areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched toward the limo. Max was still leaning against the car, arms crossed over his broad chest. There was some sympathy in his gaze, some sardonic amusement. Apparently his scope of responsibility hadn’t included stopping her. She would have liked to see him try. She was more than ready to kick someone’s ass. Instead, she was going to have him take her home. She was doing exactly what she’d intended today. Mostly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d call Research and tell them she’d report Monday, because she was in no mood to be at K\u0026amp;A today. She’d take care of that Pickard job in the early evening hours, but then she was going to a club, damn it. Not Progeny. She’d go back to Surreal, because she wouldn’t run into someone she knew, and she was already familiar with their layout. She’d tell Cass she was driving up to Baton Rouge for an overnight to follow up on the Pickard work, which was plausible, because there were a couple things she could check out there after she handled the Dumpster job here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching a movement in her peripheral vision, she noticed one of Ben’s neighbors standing on the sidewalk, a trio of apricot toy poodles in her arms, too stunned to be yappy. The woman was staring at Marcie in a fascinated, horrified way. Marcie gave her a dignified nod. “He deserved it, I promise,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman’s lips twitched. Putting the poodles down, she continued on her morning walk with only a couple backward looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax handed her his handkerchief. When Marcie glanced at him, puzzled, he touched a fingertip to her face, letting her feel the tears. “Oh shit,” she muttered. She mopped her face with it, blew her nose with a ferocious snort that had his brows rising. “Please take me home, Max. I want to stop on the way for a brownie from Starbuck’s. I’ll treat you to a coffee and you can have this omelet. I think I’d choke on it at this point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes ma’am,” he said, a glint in his eyes. Then he held the door for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly hell. He’d hit the floor like Peter under enemy fire when those first stones came through. “Fuck,” Ben snarled, under a shower of glass. Only two things kept him from shoving up from the floor to wear her ass out. One, he got hard as steel from the thought of punishing her, which undermined the whole getting-rid-of-her scenario. Two—more importantly—he deserved her anger. It was his fault for letting it go this far, and so he would take the cost. Which was apparently eight perfectly preserved panes of pre-Civil War glass. Fuck, fuck and triple fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she was done with her diatribe and he heard the limo pull away, he fished out his cell. Staying on the floor, he put in a call to his maid and maintenance services for glass cleanup and window replacement, respectively. But every word she’d shouted at him was echoing in his mind. He could imagine how she’d looked yelling at him, those gorgeous brown eyes flashing, her hair a swirl around her face, breasts heaving and fists clenched. Damn it, he was getting stiff against the floorboards, thinking about how he’d deal with her in such a temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear to God, I’m going to have to cut off my own dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen rolled to his back. He didn’t feel like getting up yet. He’d heard her threat about the club, but he also heard the waver of uncertainty behind it. She was just working off a mad, even though he had no doubt she’d end up there by herself at some point if he didn’t give her some direction. She was that stubborn. He’d make sure she had the numbers of those other Doms he’d talked about. Once she calmed down, she’d be smart enough to take them, even if her initial motive in doing so was to make him jealous. It wouldn’t. That’s what he told himself. They were nice, young, calm and sedate guys. Doms she’d find so boring they’d put her to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were too lighthanded. Even when she was crying out from every blow, her ass kept rising up to the cane, the spatula, the flogger. Those strikes made her wet, made her beg for more. Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to get to Houston. If he was smart, he’d stay there for a couple months. Or he’d come back tonight, go to Progeny himself. No, too much risk of dealing with someone he knew. He might go to Surreal. Take a taxi from the airport, hang out there until closing, have one of the limos pick him up and bring him home. He’d find a sub who’d help him forget how he’d fucked this up. He’d call Lucas later, maybe, explain the situation, though he wasn’t really sure how to do that. Maybe he’d wait and see what Marcie was going to do. She might not tell them. She was mad, and her pride was probably hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to ignore the niggling thought that it went deeper than that, but he wouldn’t duck that responsibility. He’d taken her too deep, let her get too close. It was better to wound her now, when it wasn’t mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d take her anger. Her tears would destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen: Congratulations on the five thousand you raised to help the off campus domestic violence shelter. Cass said you’ve been volunteering there. She also told me about that run-in with a husband ignoring a restraining order. She said you wouldn’t let him come into the house, basically backed him down. You have a tendency to take things to extremes, brat. A guy won’t stop to think about assault charges when he’s got a red haze in front of his eyes. Btw, we’re matching the funds you raised, and I’ve already authorized having a security system and panic button installed at the shelter. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hostile-takeover-knights-of-the-board-room-5/page-42.html","bookId":1904,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:18:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:18:30 PM"}
