Let me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave.\" One and two and three—\"Me.\"—four and—\"Alone! Breathe!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas and Alex were huddled above them, staring down, their Baranov blue eyes huge. \"He shot Daddy,\" Nicholas was saying, pressing his face into Alex\u0027s stomach. \"He shot him to grab me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He paid for it, Nicky,\" Alex said, and though she was white to the lips, her words were cold. Christina, working up a sweat doing her closed-chest massage, shivered. \"Anybody ever comes near you, they can say hello to a skull fracture, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like this, Mrs. Baranov—Your Highness. Um, both Your Highnesses ...\" The doctor, though at the top of his field, had never met a member of the royal family before. Now the private room was filled with them. Alexander and Kathryn had arrived just after the rest of the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Alex was gray-faced, but not too rattled to come up with,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep late for one day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKidnapping attempts ensue,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Alex,\" David snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give us the straight shit, Doc,\" Princess Christina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Prince David was correct—the kidnapper was using animal tranquilizers. A combination of chloral hydrate and ketamine. It seems he has a contact at the Juneau Zoo—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, another distant relative of our mother,\" Alexandria said bitterly. \"Some vet or something. And she was soooo helpful when it came to silly-ass schemes. Her ass is in jail now, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol, the head of the security team, nodded absently while listening in on her headset. The security team was jittery and slit-eyed and pissed. Recriminations could come later; right now, nobody was messing with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er...yes.\" The doctor coughed. \"The tranquilizers themselves wouldn\u0027t have hurt Prince Nicholas and would have made him very easy to— um—transport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention, they weren\u0027t supposed to hurt anyone—kill anyone,\" Carol said, thinking aloud. \"Because—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because regicide is still punishable by beheading in this country—that law\u0027s been on the books for almost two hundred years,\" Prince David said pointedly. \"Devon wouldn\u0027t have wanted to risk that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fascinating,\" Chris said impatiently, \"but why is the king still unconscious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His Majesty had a severe allergic reaction to the chloral hydrate. He\u0027s in a coma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence, broken by David\u0027s strangled, \"For—for how long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Sarett shook his head. \"He could come out of it tomorrow. Or a month from now. Or next year. Or...\" He shrugged helplessly. \"He\u0027s on a respirator for now, but we\u0027re hoping he\u0027ll start breathing on his own in ... I mean . . . sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when Christina thought she\u0027d absorbed the sheer awfulness of the news, the magnitude of what had happened, Dr. Sarett hit her broadside all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she thought he\u0027d dropped his pen and was looking for it on the floor. But then he was— was he? He was! He was bowing to her, to David. And Nicky and Alexandria and Alex and Kathryn and the security gal were all bowing, too. To them. To her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long live the king and queen,\" Dr. Sarett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fuck,\" the queen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePART FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gold cage is still a cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—King David I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, go cry in a bag of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Queen Christina\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom The Queen of the Edge of the World, by Edmund Dante III, © 2089, Harper Zebra and Schuster Publications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincess for one night; queen for. . . who knew? The Sitka Palace reeled from the attack, and not just because the king was gravely ill. Although the royal siblings all had genuine fondness for one another, none felt King David was ready. Not to mention Queen Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only that, but Prince Nicholas\u0027s parentage was finally, formally, called into doubt. King Alexander had done his best to protect his son from slander and inquisitive gossip, but now the cat was, so to speak, out of the bag. The next day, the headline for the Juneau newspaper read DNA TEST, KING DAVID?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, both within and without the Sitka Palace, recriminations were flying far and fast. How had a Domonov been able to inflict such harm so suddenly? How long had the plot been in evidence? Worse, was there more to it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar, far worse: would King Alexander survive it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions threw the royal family into its first crisis since the scandalous death of Queen Dara. Although, some historians argue, this latest crisis was just a result of that earlier one. . . the way sterility is often the result, years later, of German measles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault,\" Jenny said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Jennifer, don\u0027t be an idiot. It\u0027s my fault,\" Edmund said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both of you, don\u0027t be idiots,\" Nicholas said gloomily. They were in the king\u0027s office on the north side of the building. They had been drawn there, royals and servants alike, to take comfort in a room so strongly stamped with the king\u0027s personality. There were dead animals covering nearly every square foot of wall. It was calming, yet morbid. \"It\u0027s my fault. He was after me. He hurt Daddy because of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault,\" Kurt said. \"A pharmacist took me out with a serving platter, for fuck\u0027s sake. Anybody mind if I shoot myself in the head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you madder about the pharmacist, or the serving platter?\" Princess Alexandria asked. She got a ghost of a smile for her efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault,\" King David said. \"I should have knocked Dad out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were guarding the queen,\" Edmund pointed out. \"Your hands were full.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault,\" Carol, head of security, said. \"We were so easily diverted to the plane! I should have left more men behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, the guy had a serving platter,\" Kurt said, slumping on the end of the couch so that his shoulders made a C-shape. \"You can\u0027t do much against a serving platter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fault is all ours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe would have kicked Devon\u0027s ass\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we chose to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathryn, seated beside her haiku-spouting brother, nodded. \"Alex is right. If we\u0027d been there, you would have had more help. We would have kicked Devon\u0027s ass up so high, people would have thought he had two heads. But we slept late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stared at Kathryn, startled by such a long speech, then looked at Princess Alexandria, who glared back. \"What? It\u0027s not my fault. I\u0027m the one who took out the bad guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of,\" King David said quietly, \"how is Devon doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deader than shit, Your Majesty,\" Carol said, not looking up from her Palm Pilot, across which a constant stream of data was running. \"Want to send flowers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, but where is Her Majesty the queen?\" Edmund asked. \"Shouldn\u0027t she be here with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s baking,\" David said absently. He squirmed in his father\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandria laughed. \u0027You\u0027re like Goldilocks, Dave. \"This one\u0027s too small. . . this one\u0027s too big!\u0027 Sit still, you\u0027re making me nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This chair is too big,\" David said, and nobody commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was broken by Kathryn\u0027s hopeful, \"What\u0027s Chris baking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pie, she said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of pie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, Kath! You almost never talk, and when you do finally speak up, it\u0027s so you can find out when you can eat. Can you give your appetite a rest for five seconds?\" Princess Alex snapped, smacking her just above the elbow. The outburst was so star-ding, several of the siblings stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathryn looked around for something to toss, gave up, and said in a small voice, \"It\u0027s a national crisis. I have to keep my strength up.\" At everyone\u0027s stricken expression, she added, \"That, uh, sounded a lot funnier in my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was thrown open and Christina walked in, carrying a steaming pie with the aid of two potholders shaped like pink salmon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, good, the new caterer\u0027s here,\" Alexandria said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Alex cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody\u0027s touchy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday it\u0027s acceptable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill: take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina set the pie down in the middle of the conference table and pulled a knife out of her back pocket, and a pile of napkins out of her other back pocket, which she set next to the pie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund and Jenny, of course, were on their feet the minute the queen entered. \"Good afternoon, Your Majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howdy, Jenny. Eds. Welcome back. Sorry your vacation got cut short.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our fault this happened, \"Jenny began dolefully. Her lovely eyes were rimmed in red. Hers weren\u0027t the only ones, either. \"I\u0027m sure I would have recognized him ... at least run him through our database ... I know most of the Domonovs on sight... at the least I would have thrown myself in front of the darts ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, your eighty pounds would have made all the difference, Jenn. Listen up, everyone. Blame is a pie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blame smells like blueberries?\" Alexandria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored the interruption. \"It\u0027s a pie. Everybody gets a slice. So here we go. First slice to me ... I might be new to the royal game, but I\u0027ve been cooking since I was eight. I ought to be able to spot a fake caterer... or a pharmacist posing as one. He wasn\u0027t just nervous because he was about to do a dirty deed. He was nervous because he didn\u0027t know dick about food, and he was afraid we\u0027d— I\u0027d—ask him something. In retrospect, duh.\" She cut herself a small slice; the room instantly filled with the smell of sugary crust and hot fruit. She set the wedge on a napkin and pushed it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carol, front and center.\" Carol put her Palm away and slowly came forward. \"Needless to say, Security\u0027s been asking themselves some hard questions since this happened.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-31.html","bookId":2789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM"}
