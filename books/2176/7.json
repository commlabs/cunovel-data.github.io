{"id":99389,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe greyness lasts a few seconds. Like a mist around me, except there\u0027s no damp or cool sensation. Then it parts and I find myself surrounded by trees. A forest of crooked, twisted, pitiful trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re howling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I think something else is making the horrible noise, like a mix of car brakes squealing and somebody sawing through metal. My brain tells me there are workmen nearby, or a weird animal. But then I see the trees moving, swaying weakly. There are holes in their dark, mottled bark. And the howls are coming from the holes. No question about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try applying logic to the situation, like Mr. Spock. The howls must be the wind blowing through the holes. Except there isn\u0027t any wind. And I know - I know - that the trees are making the noise themselves. They\u0027re alive. In pain. Howling with anger, hatred - and hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look for the window but there\u0027s nothing. Either you can\u0027t see it from this side or it broke up into pieces while I was staring at the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a hesitant step forward. There\u0027s a soft splashing sound. I look down. See water everywhere underfoot, covering the ground. I look again at the trees. I can\u0027t see any roots. They\u0027re all below the waterline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouch, trying to see how deep the water is. But it\u0027s murky and muddy, and the trees block out most of the light. I stick a finger in. It slides down to the first knuckle, the second, the beginning of my palm. I push my hand in up to my wrist without touching anything solid. Stare at my hand, then my feet. I could be standing on a platform. Except I know - the same way I knew about the trees -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that I\u0027m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing on the surface of the water!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rise quickly, fear setting in again, certain I\u0027m about to drop and drown. But although water splashes when I move my feet, I don\u0027t sink. I explore with my right foot, angling it downwards. It dips into the water. But when I bring it back up, level my foot and plant my sole down, the surface supports me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take one step. Two. A third. It\u0027s not the same as walking on land. More like walking across the floor of an inflatable castle. But somehow, impossibly, the water keeps me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at the craziness of it, then gasp as pain flares in my right arm. I\u0027d completely forgotten about my broken limb. The sudden surge of pain reminds me that I\u0027m walking wounded. I\u0027ve never broken an arm before. It doesn\u0027t hurt as much as I thought it would, but it\u0027s certainly no picnic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carry on walking, trying to keep my arm from jolting. Easier said than done - the watery floor is uneven, hard to balance on. I don\u0027t feel as if I\u0027m going to fall, but I tilt left and right quite often. I have to use my arms to maintain my balance, which sets off the pain again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deliberately don\u0027t think about where I am or the impossibility of walking on water. I can\u0027t care about stuff like that. I\u0027m here to find Art. Nothing else matters. I can marvel at the rest of it once we\u0027re both back home, safe with Sally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, like that\u0027s gonna happen, an inner voice sniggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore it. Try not to let the howls of the trees unsettle me. Stagger on in search of my kidnapped brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water has seeped through my shoes and socks, and is climbing up the legs of my trousers. I take no notice. I have bigger things to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no sign of the four humans, the demon or Art. And no way of tracking them. If we were in a normal forest, perhaps there would be footprints. But apart from ripples as I move across the water, the surface is smooth, unmarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t seen any animals or birds. Only the trees. And there aren\u0027t even leaves on those. I\u0027d think they were dead if not for the howls, which echo relentlessly. The noise is like needles poking away at my eardrums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat now? the voice inside my head asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep walking,\" I answer aloud, trying to drown out the howls of the trees. \"They have to be here somewhere. I\u0027ll find them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot necessarily. They might have gone through another window. Or maybe they didn\u0027t come out the same place you did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find them,\" I insist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if you don\u0027t? There\u0027s nothing to eat. Nowhere to aim for - every bit of this forest looks the same. And how will you sleep? The water might not hold you if you lie down. Even if it does, it\u0027ll drench you to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can sleep on the branches of a tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they eat humans, the voice suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" I mutter unconvincingly. \"And there are probably fish in the water. I can catch one to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr it might catch you, the voice notes. There could be sharks. Underwater monsters. Waiting. Moving in for the kill. Underneath you right this min -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" I growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Art!\" I yell. \"Art!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer. The screech of the trees would probably muffle his cry even if he was here and trying to call back. It\u0027s hopeless. I\u0027ll never find him. He\u0027s probably dead anyway, ripped to pieces by the demon. I should try to find a way home. Worry about myself, not my doomed brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can\u0027t think that way. I won\u0027t. I\u0027ve got to believe he\u0027s alive. The thought of returning home without Art (even if I knew how) is too awful to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve no idea how long I\u0027ve been here. My watch isn\u0027t working - it stopped when I came through the grey window. Feels like a few hours. I\u0027m wet, cold, miserable, alone. Trying hard not to think about Logan and the kids killed by the demon. Flinching every time my brain recycles an image of the bloodshed. I force myself to focus on other memories. There\u0027s no time to deal with the massacre. I have to concentrate on finding Art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome small orange patches of light are flashing several feet ahead of me. They began pulsing soon after I got here. They move with me as I wander the watery forest, keeping me company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come to a semi-clearing. The trees don\u0027t grow so thickly together here. I can see the sky, gloomy and purplish. The sun shines dimly on my left-hand side - and a second sun shines weakly to my right!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub my eyes and look again. The suns are still there. Not strong like the sun I\u0027m used to. Smaller, duller. I\u0027m not as amazed by the twin suns as I should be - the water and howling trees tipped me off to the fact that I wasn\u0027t on my own world any more. I wonder how day and night work here, or if there even is a night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m staring upwards, several patches of pulsing light pass by. Different colours, shapes and sizes, slowly gliding along in the same direction. I look around and notice other patches floating through the trees, converging on a point far off to my left. Without any kind of trail, I\u0027ve been walking aimlessly. Now I decide to follow the moving lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe an hour later I spot the four humans who came through the window after the demon. They\u0027re standing in a clearing, the old bearded man slightly apart from the others. I think he\u0027s muttering a spell, hands wriggling by his sides. He\u0027s the focus for the moving, pulsing lights. They\u0027re gathering in the space in front of him, slotting together, forming a window like the one in the village field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI creep up without them seeing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...still say we should have killed him,\" the Indian woman is saying. \"It was not right, letting him murder the children and take one of them. We are supposed to protect people. That is our duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The master knows what he is doing,\" the black man says. \"He would not have let the demon go without good cause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get used to people dying,\" the young blonde woman says. \"Beranabus isn\u0027t interested in saving the lives of a few individuals. He doesn\u0027t have time for trivialities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trivialities?\" the Indian woman explodes. \"You call the loss of human life a trivi - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the younger woman interrupts. \"That\u0027s what Beranabus calls it. He says we serve a greater purpose, that our mission is nothing less than the protection of mankind itself. He says we can\u0027t worry about every human killed by demons, or waste time chasing strays. He doesn\u0027t mind you lot doing it, but we - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to work!\" the elderly man - Beranabus - barks, turning angrily. \"If you\u0027d stop chattering like monkeys, maybe I could...\" He sees me and stops. \"Who the hell is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others whirl around defensively. They pause when they see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t look like a demon,\" the black man says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some don\u0027t,\" the young woman growls. \"A few can take human form. You have to be careful.\" She raises her right hand. I sense power in her fingertips. Power directed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I cry. \"Don\u0027t hurt me! I\u0027m not a demon! I\u0027m Kernel Fleck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman\u0027s fingers curl inward, holding back the magical power which she was about to unleash. She frowns. \"He doesn\u0027t sound like a demon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the boy from the village,\" the Indian woman says. \"He was with the child Cadaver kidnapped.\" She smiles at me. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I squeak nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he doing here?\" Beranabus huffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine he came through the window after us,\" the Indian woman says. \"In search of his brother perhaps?\" She arches an eyebrow questioningly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The monster - demon - stole my brother, Art. I came to get him back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Beranabus snorts. \"It will have slaughtered and devoured him by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beranabus!\" the Indian woman hisses. \"Do not say such a thing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not know that. And even if it is, you should not say it. Not in front of...\" She nods at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus laughs. \"If the child was bold enough to follow us, he\u0027s bold enough to be told the truth. Isn\u0027t that right, boy? We don\u0027t have to lie. You\u0027d rather we were honest about it, aye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Art isn\u0027t dead,\" I say, my voice trembling. \"He\u0027s alive. I\u0027m going to get him back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steal him back from Cadaver?\" Beranabus laughs again. \"You\u0027re brave, but stupid. You couldn\u0027t find him, not if you searched for the rest of your life. So it doesn\u0027t really matter if he\u0027s alive or not, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the demon\u0027s name?\" I ask, ignoring his question. \"Cadaver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. But that\u0027s no use to you. What are you going to do - report him to your police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to send this boy back,\" the young woman says. \"Open another window. Return him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time,\" Beranabus says. \"Cadaver knows we\u0027re after him. He\u0027s on the run. The further ahead he gets, the harder he\u0027ll be to find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter. We must - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re chasing him?\" I cut in, excited. \"You\u0027re going after the monster who stole my brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Beranabus says, eyes twinkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll come with you. Please. Let me. When you find him, if Art\u0027s still... you know... I can snatch him back. Take him home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the Indian woman says immediately. \"It is too dangerous. You do not know what you would be letting yourself in for... Excuse me, but what did you say your name was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kernel. Kernel Fleck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Sharmila.\" She smiles. \"You must go home, Kernel. If we find your brother, we will return him to you. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say stubbornly. \"I want to help find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help?\" Beranabus repeats, cocking an amused eyebrow. \"How exactly do you plan to help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I don\u0027t know. With the spells? The lights?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What lights?\" Beranabus frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to the patches of light which are joining together ahead of him. He looks at where I\u0027m pointing and his frown deepens. I realise these people can\u0027t see the patches either. Before I can explain, the black man speaks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sharmila and Nadia are right, master. This child does not belong here. We must return him. If we don\u0027t... if we leave him in this nightmarish world of water and screaming trees... we will be no better than the demons we seek to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus sniffs. \"A nice plea, Raz, but I never claimed to be any better than the Demonata. I say we leave him, and my word is final - isn\u0027t it, Nadia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks hard at the young woman. She stares back defiantly for a few seconds, then drops her gaze. \"It wouldn\u0027t take long to open a window...\" she mutters. \"I could do it while you search for Cadaver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not very skilled at finding your way around,\" Beranabus says. \"What makes you think you could locate the right place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could try,\" she insists. \"And even if I don\u0027t find the exact spot, I can return him to our world. He could make his own way home from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus thinks a moment, then shrugs. \"So be it. Waste your time if you wish. But keep out of my way, so you don\u0027t interfere with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going!\" I shout. \"I came to find Art and I\u0027m not going home without him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kernel,\" the black man - Raz - says, \"you don\u0027t know what is happening. This is not a place for children. You must go home. Mustn\u0027t he, Sharmila?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the Indian woman says, glaring at me like an angry teacher. \"I gave you my word that I will return your brother to you if we find him alive. That will have to be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me,\" the younger woman - Nadia - says with a sad smile, \"you don\u0027t want to stay here. You\u0027ve followed us into a different universe - the home of the Demonata. It\u0027s a hell-hole. This part isn\u0027t so bad, but we\u0027re going to encounter far worse very soon. You don\u0027t want to be with us when that happens. I wouldn\u0027t be here if I had a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" I say, close to tears. \"Art\u0027s my brother. Mum told me to look after him. I\u0027m not going back alone.\" Softly, voice cracking, I add, \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharmila\u0027s eyes go soft with pity. \"I am sorry, Kernel. We have spoken harshly. But you have to understand - it is impossible. You cannot stay. You could do no good here. You must go home. Your parents will be frantic, thinking they have lost you both. That is not fair, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but...\" I can\u0027t find the words to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough talk,\" Beranabus grunts, losing his patience. \"The boy wants to stay... you lot want to send him home... this is easily decided.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicks a hand at me. Suddenly, I\u0027m flying through the air. I smack hard into a tree and cry out with shock and pain, mostly from my broken arm. As I fall to the ground, the branches of the tree move quickly. Catch me. Wrap themselves round me. Squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch sight of Sharmila darting to my rescue. Beranabus waves a hand, stopping her. The branches tighten. The tree howls louder than ever. I\u0027m lifted up. The holes in its bark are expanding. It means to crush and swallow me. A few seconds more and I\u0027ll be dead, killed and eaten by this monstrous sham of a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flares within me. I scream at the tree, set my teeth on the nearest branch to my face and bite hard. The tree screeches. I chew through the branch, snapping it loose. Another. My left arm comes free. There\u0027s heat in my palm. I grab a branch and feel power shoot through my hand, into the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tree howls with pain, then abruptly releases me. I drop, hit the water, go under, come up spluttering and thrashing. I dip under again. This time I stay there, feeling the water drag me down. I realise the water\u0027s alive too, like the trees. Just as hungry and eager to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the panic. Force my legs to stop kicking wildly. Direct the power in my palm down towards my feet. I imagine myself as a rocket, blasting off, breaking free of the pull of the water. For a few seconds nothing happens. My lungs tighten. My mouth twitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, in a sudden burst, I explode upwards, out of the water, coughing, shivering, but free. I land on my feet and this time the surface of the water holds. There\u0027s terrible pain in my broken arm as I land, but I quickly use the power to numb myself to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI face Beranabus, furious at him for launching me at the tree and nearly killing me. Ready to attack him, to use my power to smash him to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s laughing. The others are staring at me, stunned, but Beranabus is laughing. \"I thought so!\" he cackles. \"I guessed there was more to this one than mere flesh and bone. Ordinary children don\u0027t step out of their own world into the universe of the Demonata. You need to be one of us to be that crazy. We\u0027ll hold on to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Sharmila cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... master... he\u0027s only a child,\" Raz mumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a bad idea,\" Nadia adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" Beranabus says, waving away their protests. He grins at me, but it\u0027s the smile of a cut-throat pirate. \"You want to stay and help us find Cadaver? You want to search for your brother and rescue him like a knight of old? Very well, boy, you\u0027ve got your wish.\" He sticks out an arm, even though we\u0027re too far from each other to shake hands. \"You\u0027re one of us now, Kernel Fleck. A demon hunter. Welcome to the Disciples!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-7.html","bookId":2176,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM"}
