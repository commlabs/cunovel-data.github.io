He was certain to be the new mayor, despite Steven Mann\u0027s dirty politicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny was a fading leader as he struggled with health problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople automatically deferred to Travis now. The vote was the last step to making his ascension to the fort leader official.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sadler Farm. It\u0027s a family and a few workers. They\u0027ve been holed up in the main house since the second day of the outbreak. It\u0027s an old stone house with storm windows, shutters and doors. Originally, they declined joining us. They felt they had it under control. Considering how far out they are, you would think they would be safe, but a wave of the dead arrived about ten days ago. They\u0027re just about out of ammo now and they are low on food. For awhile, they told me they had come and gone from the house to the garden and the chicken coops with no issue. Then one day the zombies hit in force and they lost two men and ended up barely holding them off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerit nodded stoically. “The RN is where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bowie High School in Raymond,” Peggy answered. “She has two teachers and four kids with her. Two are hers. She was at the school giving flu shots on the first day. The school was evacuated, but they remained behind deliberately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Nerit\u0027s gaze was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy laughed a little. “She watches horror movies and saw one of the walking dead and was pretty sure it was a zombie. Then she noticed bites on some of the people being put on the buses. So she and the others hid and waited until everyone had been shipped off to a rescue center, then barricaded themselves inside the school. It\u0027s a very small school, so it wasn\u0027t that hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerit smiled wryly. “Horror movies…odd how they became a guideline for survival.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie joined them, dressed in hunting gear. She leaned into Travis and he slung an arm around her shoulders. A tender kiss followed, Peggy grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy loved seeing them together. Her own marriage had been rocky and never very romantic. She knew she was a sucker for country love songs and soap operas. She couldn\u0027t help it. But this was the real thing. She could see it. Feel it. Travis and Katie had found real, true love. She was happy for them. She just wished it would one day happen to her. Of course, in this dead world, what were the chances of that? “So these are the last two groups?” Travis pondered over the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One more. A family trapped in a trailer. Again, doing okay until a recent mob of zombies arrived a few days ago. They were also holdouts, but they have not been doing so well. They\u0027re just bullheaded country folk, but they now need us to go get them.” Peggy tapped the map and stared up at Nerit and Travis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerit was deep in thought, her finger tracing over the various points on the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is out there right now?” Travis leaned against the counter and stared up at Peggy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really liked his style. He always gave his full attention to her and valued her opinion. It wasn\u0027t like how she had to bust heads with Manny constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ed is out with his group protecting the harvesting of his peach groves right now,” Peggy answered. “He took Lenore with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lenore?” Travis blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I felt she was ready,” Nerit muttered as she studied the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenni is out on a scavenging run with Curtis, Katarina, Felix and Dylan,” Katie added. “They\u0027re due back soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dylan? We sent Dylan out? Isn\u0027t he a bit young?” Travis arched an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He just turned eighteen. We have men in the military that age…or at least we did,” Nerit pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And no one out on the field is reporting anything odd? No bandits?” Travis lifted his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, just those waves of zombies showing up. Kinda like they do here. I think that\u0027s the bandits,” Peggy answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree with that assessment.” Nerit began to write notes down on a pad of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t think they\u0027ve decided maybe we\u0027re too big to take on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think they\u0027re trying to figure out what to do with us,” Travis answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed.” Nerit leaned over the map and studied it. “Waiting for a time to strike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen rushed down the hall from the communication center and leaped behind the counter. Hugging Peggy, he startled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my gawd! You will not believe my news!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis slightly smiled. “Oh, yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah! Ed called in from where they are getting all those delicious peaches!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the good news is we\u0027re having peach cobbler?” Katie queried teasingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen gave her a dark look. “I\u0027m building this up. You\u0027re cramping my style! Shush, you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spill it, Ken.” Peggy was about to smack him upside the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My girl, Lenore, my bestest girl, is safe and on her way back with mission numero uno under her belt. That\u0027s the first part. Second part, Ed\u0027s boys were there!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No shit?” Peggy was stunned. Ed rarely spoke of the three sons that were somewhere out on the deadlands. When he did, it was often when he was drunk. The boys were all Ed had left in the world after his wife, Edna, had died. All three had been away at school on the first day. Peggy knew Ed had hopes they were still alive, but this was amazing news. “Seriously. The boys were all alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep! They fought their way back to Ed\u0027s farm and holed up there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey thought their Daddy was dead until they saw him in the peach groves with the team!” Ken danced around. “Lenore is trying to find out if any of them are gay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear to God, all you think about is finding a boyfriend,” Peggy groused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like you don\u0027t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, my sex life, or lack thereof, ain\u0027t your business.” Peggy shook her pen in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hard up, aren\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m gonna kick your ass, Ken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie smirked. “My money is on Peggy if they throw down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis shook his head as he laughed. “Ken looks kinda vicious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen playfully snarled at him. “Okay, good news time is over! Back to the communication center!” He bounced back down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m gonna choke him. I swear to God, I will,” Peggy muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerit looked up from her map, seeming impervious to Ken\u0027s exploits. “I think I see how we need to handle this. What we need to do. They\u0027re after resources: food, guns, drugs, and women. We\u0027re going to need to lure them out. I think I know how.” She tapped the map with one finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy leaned over and looked at where she was pointing. “Nerit, that\u0027s where you\u0027re from. No one is there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The gun store is there,” Nerit said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis shifted uncomfortably on his feet. “You said the weapons are in the safe. They can\u0027t get in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. They can\u0027t. But we\u0027re going to need those weapons. That ammunition. We\u0027ve put off going out there.” Nerit looked very pale, but calm. “We should have gone before.” She pulled out her keys and handed them to Travis. “It\u0027s the round gold key and silver square one to get into the store. I will give you the safe combination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone gathering around the map looked uncomfortable. An excursion to the gun store to reclaim the last of the gun stock and ammunition had long been on the list of things to do, but they had found other stockpiles to keep them well armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy shifted on her feet, feeling uncomfortable with where this was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis slid the keys into his pocket. “We didn\u0027t really need to go until now, you know. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn\u0027t go because of Ralph,” Nerit said simply. “And we have no time for such sentimentality anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis reached out and rubbed her shoulder gently. “We\u0027ll be respectful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Nerit answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slipped an arm around the older woman\u0027s waist. Nerit, surprisingly, leaned against her for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we head to the store and make a production of it, that will pull them out. And we can use it as a diversion to get the last of our survivors in,” Nerit said in a slightly quavering voice. “We need to pull them out. Get them to confront us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we can get into a fight with the bandits?” Peggy looked at her incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, so we can show them they can\u0027t beat us,” Nerit answered grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis looked at Nerit long and hard, then slowly nodded. “I get where you are going with this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ll work out the details, but I have the general plan already in my head,” Nerit answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni exploded into the lobby of the hotel. Her fury was livid in her eyes and her skin was flushed. “Where the hell is Bill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Communication center,” Peggy said, and pointed down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s training Ken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s going on?” Katie stepped toward Jenni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fucktard got Dylan killed!” She pointed behind her, trembling with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis came into view, his head down, looking pale. “Jenni, I didn\u0027t mean to-” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fighting-to-survive-as-the-world-dies-2/page-52.html","bookId":2482,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:58:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:58:30 PM"}
