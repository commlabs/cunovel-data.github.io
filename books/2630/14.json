After working late at the pizza place he managed, his father hadn\u0027t come home until way past Carter\u0027s bedtime. Carter had lain awake, worrying that his father would somehow discover Rusty in the house. If he did, he just might take the dog away in the middle of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Carter heard the garage door close, he\u0027d prayed really hard that Rusty wouldn\u0027t bark at the strange noise. The dog seemed to have a sixth sense about things like that, because he stayed quiet all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter could hear his parents talking, and even though he\u0027d had his ear against the door, he couldn\u0027t make out their words. All he knew was that after about ten minutes they went to bed. Then and only then was Carter able to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, he sneaked down the hallway and freed Rusty from the laundry room. Rusty wanted outside, and Carter let him into the backyard to do his business. As soon as he\u0027d finished, Rusty hurried back onto the porch, where Carter waited for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hungry, boy?\" Carter asked softly. No one else in the house was awake. He bent down and stroked the rich auburn fur of his new best friend. Then he led Rusty back into the laundry room and filled his water dish. He gave him a bowl of Wheaties with milk because they didn\u0027t have any dog food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRusty seemed to like the cereal and when he\u0027d licked the bowl clean, Carter returned to his bedroom. The dog walked politely beside him. Without being asked, Carter made his bed, dressed and brushed his teeth, too. All the while, Rusty lay on his bedroom rug, his eyes never leaving Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard his parents stir, Carter was ready. He knew it would take a lot of fast talking to convince his father to let him keep Rusty. His one hope was that once he heard Rusty had followed him home, he\u0027d understand that this was a special dog. This was the dog God had sent Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough his partially open door, he could hear his father step into the kitchen and immediately start making coffee. Rusty dashed out of the bedroom before Carter could stop him. He raced after the dog but it was too late. Rusty skidded into the kitchen, his long tail wagging excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father caught sight of Rusty and bent down to pet him. \"Where did you come from, boy?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Dad,\" Carter said tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a friend spending the night?\" David asked, glancing at his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter swallowed hard. \"Rusty\u0027s my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rusty?\" his father repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I named him after the dog you had when you were a kid. You told me about him, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly his father nodded. \"Where did you get the dog, Carter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter\u0027s mother came into the kitchen just then, tying the sash on her housecoat. She looked uneasily from Carter to his father. \"I meant to tell you about Rusty last night, David,\" she said, pouring them each a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it slipped your mind,\" David commented, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I decided you were too tired and didn\u0027t need to deal with another problem. We couldn\u0027t do anything until morning anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father turned to Carter. \"Where did you get the dog?\" he asked a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in the schoolyard, but Dad, this is a special dog. Really special. Out of all the kids there, Rusty came to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you feed him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was starving, Dad! And his coat was all muddy and...he needs a family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave him something to eat, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Carter bit his lip. \"I fed him a Twinkie and then Bailey let me have her peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.\" Because he wanted his father to know his sister hadn\u0027t willingly donated her sandwich, he explained. \"I traded my Saturday TV privileges, though, so Bailey would give me her sandwich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carter,\" his father said gently. \"Rusty came to you because he thought you\u0027d feed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at first,\" Carter insisted. \"He didn\u0027t know about the Twinkie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could probably smell it in your pocket. Dogs have a keen sense of smell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for him following you home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he...Rusty\u0027s not just any dog. He\u0027s smart and he listens and he understands, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father crouched down so they were eye to eye. \"Did you encourage him to follow you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He followed the bus! I told you, Dad - he\u0027s smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, his father rested a hand on Carter\u0027s shoulder. \"Rusty could see that you liked him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more than that!\" Carter cried. \"I prayed really hard and God sent me Rusty. He was so muddy I...I didn\u0027t even know his fur was red until I gave him a bath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In our tub?\" his father asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter nodded reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father stood and cast him a disapproving look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he make a mess?\" The question was directed at Carter\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cleaned it up,\" Carter inserted. \"Tell him, Mom, tell Dad that I washed out the bathtub and everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did,\" she confirmed, handing his father a mug of fresh coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid accepted it, closing his eyes as he took his first sip. \"I\u0027m glad you cleaned up after the dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, Carter offered his father a hopeful smile. \"It was like God was telling me this dog was for me because he had red fur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pained look appeared on his father\u0027s face. \"Did you stop to think that Rusty might belong to another little boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought had never entered Carter\u0027s mind. \"Rusty might have another family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father set the mug aside and put his hand on Carter\u0027s shoulder once again. \"There could be a little boy out there who\u0027s lost his dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Rusty,\" Carter said with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t be sure of anything when it comes to a stray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter shook his head. \"Rusty needs a family,\" he stated boldly. \"Our family. He adopted us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same sad look came over his father. \"I wish we could keep him. He seems like a nice dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a wonderful dog, and he\u0027s housebroken and he doesn\u0027t eat much. He can have my food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid drew one hand across his face. \"If it was just a matter of food, we could deal with that, but it isn\u0027t. I already explained this to you, Carter. There are the vet\u0027s fees for one thing. Since Rusty\u0027s been on the streets for a while, he should be checked out by a veterinarian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pay for it with my allowance,\" Carter said. \"I have thirty dollars and seventy-six cents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David,\" his mother murmured in a soft, pleading voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wouldn\u0027t begin to cover the cost of a checkup and shots. And what if he needs some kind of treatment? Then there\u0027s the license and heaven knows what else. We can\u0027t keep him, Carter. I don\u0027t want to sound heartless but we\u0027d be doing Rusty a disservice, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter didn\u0027t want to cry but his eyes filled with tears before he could hold them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother wrapped her arms around him and held him close. \"I\u0027m so sorry, honey,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will you take him?\" Carter sobbed, looking up at his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll have to go to the animal shelter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Daddy, please!\" Bailey came into the kitchen, dragging her stuffed Winnie the Pooh bear on the linoleum. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was all frizzy because she\u0027d gone to bed with it wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t Rusty stay until Christmas?\" Carter begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll just make it harder to give him up,\" his father said. \"Besides, we don\u0027t know if he\u0027s picked up any parasites, and the sooner he\u0027s checked out, the better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRusty lay down on the small rug in front of the kitchen sink and rested his head on his paws. Bailey sat on the floor next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up, Bailey. He probably has fleas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he doesn\u0027t, Dad,\" Carter said. \"I washed him real good. Ask Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take him down to the shelter this afternoon,\" his father said, not waiting to see if Bailey obeyed him. He walked out of the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom?\" Carter could feel the tears running down his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard your father.\" She looked like she wanted to cry, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember what Dad said about some other little boy losing Rusty? Can you imagine how happy he\u0027ll be to find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter tried to imagine what it would be like to lose his dog and how awful he\u0027d feel. Sniffling, he wiped his cheeks with one sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we take Rusty to the animal shelter, that little boy will get him back,\" his mother went on in a reassuring voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing brave was hard, but Carter did his best. His lower lip quivered and he sat down on the floor and buried his face in the dog\u0027s fur. Bailey sat on Rusty\u0027s other side, clutching her bear and murmuring sweetly. As if seeking a way to comfort him, Rusty licked Carter\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might have another family that loves you even more than I do.\" Carter\u0027s voice broke as he spoke to the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carter,\" his mother said softly. \"As soon as we can afford it, you\u0027ll have your dog. I talked to Mrs. Smith at the school, and she said there\u0027ll be an opening at the cafeteria in February. I\u0027m going to apply for it and if I get the job, then you can have a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope flared and then just as quickly died. \"But it won\u0027t be Rusty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" his mother agreed, \"it won\u0027t be Rusty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want any dog except Rusty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Carter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it, Mom. Rusty\u0027s the only dog I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should never have let you bring him in the house,\" his mother said, and she sounded angry with herself. \"It just makes this more difficult. I\u0027m so sorry, honey, but your dad\u0027s right. We can\u0027t give Rusty the kind of home he needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rusty is Carter\u0027s dog,\" Bailey wailed. She held her Pooh bear tight against her chest, as if she was afraid their father would take her stuffed friend to the animal shelter, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I call Grandma?\" Carter asked. His grandparents were his last hope. If he explained everything to them, maybe they\u0027d be willing to pay for the checkup, the dog license and whatever else Rusty needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grandparents are gone this weekend,\" his mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t call them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Carter, they\u0027re visiting friends in Seattle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter knew he didn\u0027t have any choice. He had to give up his dog. He spent all morning with Rusty, talking to him. Bailey used her own hairbrush to comb the dog\u0027s fur until it was shiny and bright. Rusty stood still and even seemed to enjoy Bailey\u0027s ministrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidafternoon, his father came into Carter and Bailey\u0027s bedroom. \"You ready, son?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter wouldn\u0027t ever be ready. He hugged Rusty around the neck, face buried in his fur, and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to,\" Carter said stubbornly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father sighed. \"Okay, then. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRusty seemed to think they were going to a fun place, because the instant David opened the car door, he leaped inside and lay down in the backseat next to Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father didn\u0027t say a single word on the ride to the shelter in Wenatchee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did Carter. He stroked Rusty\u0027s head and struggled not to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe county animal shelter was busy. Lots of people had come by to choose dogs and cats during the Christmas holidays. Some other family would be getting Rusty. Some other little boy would get Carter\u0027s special dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stay in the car if you want,\" his father told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Carter was determined to be with his dog as long as he possibly could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father went inside the shelter and came back with a woman who was carrying a collar and leash. Carter listened as his father spoke to the lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son found Rusty in the schoolyard, and the dog followed him home. According to my wife, the poor thing was caked in mud. He seems to be a gentle dog, and he\u0027s obviously had some training, so I assume he\u0027s lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father opened the passenger door and Rusty raised his head expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman reached into the car and stroked Rusty\u0027s head. \"Oh, what an attractive dog he is. Probably part Irish setter - they\u0027re a nice breed. We could\u0027ve adopted him out a dozen times over earlier in the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t news Carter wanted to hear. \"What about his other family? My dad said there might be other people who owned Rusty.\" That was his one comfort - that bringing Rusty to the shelter might help the dog locate his original owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady from the shelter sighed. \"His other family didn\u0027t take very good care of him, though, did they?\" she said. \"Rusty didn\u0027t have any identification on him, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Carter admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe examined the insides of Rusty\u0027s ears. \"No tattoos, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will you figure out who owns him, then?\" Carter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can check for a microchip, but I doubt we\u0027ll find one. Without that, there\u0027s no way of knowing where his family is,\" she explained. \"Still, this is the best time of year to guarantee him a good home. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be adopted quickly. That\u0027s what you want for him, isn\u0027t it?\" She looked directly at Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard though it was to agree, Carter nodded. With his heart breaking, he threw his arms around Rusty for one last hug. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-14.html","bookId":2630,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:07 PM"}
