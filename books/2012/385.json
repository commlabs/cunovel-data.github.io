They met a solid shieldwall. The impact sent bodies and weapons into the air and the crush made both sides recoil, before closing once more in savage fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Abrastal, still mounted, her sword and forearm painted with blood, forced her charger away from the inside edge of the Evertine line – the animal’s muzzle was gushing blood from a frenzied bite against a visored face and its hind flanks were slashed through the cladding, spattering blood with every muscle surge. But she could feel the pounding of its heart and she knew that her horse had never felt more alive than at this moment – it was impossible for her not to grin at the terrible joy in the beast she rode. Impossible to not find herself sharing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, they’d arrived upon the crux – and looking to the west, she saw the Letherii forces withdrawing from the assault, though their onager salvos continued unabated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pure had done as she had expected – seeking to break her hold here, forcing the Letherii away from any hope of marching to the Spire by blocking the valley – but only if they could succeed in turning the Evertine Legion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rode hard round to the back of her legion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill held in reserve, the Barghast ranks were readying weapons, and Abrastal caught sight of Warchief Spax, standing atop a small hill of bundled supplies and straining to see over the Evertine ranks to the front of the battle. She saw him turn to her upon hearing her horse’s drumming hoofbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reined in before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ve never swum in a sea of blood before, Firehair. How was it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen glanced down to see herself lathered in gore. She shook her sword clear. ‘How fast were those Perish moving?’ she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A good clip – almost as quickly as a band of White Faces on the raid. If they have anything left after tackling the valley side, they should be almost in position – but Highness, you’ve seen how many are headed their way.’ He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can they even slow them down?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warchief shrugged. ‘Depends on the lay of the land, I suppose. If it’s a broad front they need to hold … no, they’ll barely slow ’em.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal cursed under her breath as she swung her mount round. Thought furiously for a moment, and then nodded. ‘Very well. Warchief, take your warriors and the Teblor and move with all haste to support the Perish – whatever you can manage, understood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You send us to our deaths, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye.’ She bared her teeth at him. ‘I show you my coin. You show me your love.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wasn’t complaining, just saying.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will screen you here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness, you can’t hold against this counter-attack – we can see that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will screen you for as long as is needed,’ Abrastal said firmly. ‘Now get going, Warchief.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If we do not meet again, Firehair, I should tell you’ – and Spax leapt down from the mound of supplies – ‘I went and knocked up your daughter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods below!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’ll have years of doting on that little runt – you’ll know it for mine ’cause it’s got my eyes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just get going for Errant’s sake!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, Spax raised his axe and waved it in a circle over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one, the White Faces lunged into motion – eastward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpressed in spite of herself, Abrastal watched in silence for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpax was following her gaze. ‘Aye, we live for this, Firehair. We’ll give a good account of ourselves, I promise you.’ He looked up at her. ‘Sing songs about us, and remember to tell your court poets, that’s Gilk with one k.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned down at him. ‘How else would it be, you fool?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fare you well, my queen,’ Spax said, bowing even as he turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he’d trotted a dozen paces Abrastal called out, ‘Spax!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warchief glanced back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Boy or girl, I’ll make sure it’s named after you – but that’s the only favour you’ll get!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, the Barghast waved his weapon, and then was on his way again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the Teblor falling in alongside the mass of White Faces, and then she swung round to study her legion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, they were being driven back – these Kolansii heavies were anything but soft. Abrastal adjusted her grip on the sword in her hand, collected the reins once more.
