THE BOOK-KEEPER\u0027S TRIUMPH.","content":"\u0026nbsp;In less time than was anticipated Mr. Bradford came to the office, his arm being so far well that it no longer gave him any trouble. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The book-keeper did not delay long to open his batteries upon Paul. On the second day, our hero being out, Manson began:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would like to say a few words to you, Mr. Bradford, about the new boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"About Paul?\" asked Mr. Bradford, lifting his eyes from the morning paper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, proceed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t say I am satisfied with him, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed! What is the matter?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He is not respectful to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I may say he is positively impudent at times.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That surprises me. He seems to me very unlikely to be guilty of such offenses.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 212]\"I dare say; he is very artful. I presume he is very respectful to you. That is policy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should suppose he would consider it politic to be respectful to you also, Mr. Manson.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All the other boys have, but this boy puts on a great many airs. In fact, he is mighty independent. I suppose it is on account of the extremely high wages he receives.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, ten dollars is very high pay for a boy of his age,\" admitted Mr. Bradford.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course he doesn\u0027t earn it. He doesn\u0027t earn half as much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may be right. I should not be inclined to pay another boy nearly as much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Manson was sorry to hear this, as, could he obtain the position for Julius at ten dollars a week, his young nephew had agreed to pay him a commission of two dollars a week, which the book-keeper, being fond of money, was not above accepting.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you any other complaints to make about Paul?\" asked Mr. Bradford. \"Doesn\u0027t he attend to his duties?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Fairly well,\" Manson admitted, reluctantly, the fact being that there had never been a boy in the office so efficient as our hero, the ex-train boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Humph! I am glad to hear that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 213]\"Still it is of course disagreeable to have a boy under me who treats me with insolence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do I understand, then, that you would prefer to have a change?\" inquired the manufacturer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to make any trouble, sir,\" said the book-keeper, who could be polite enough to his employer, \"but I should really be glad to have another boy in Paul\u0027s place.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well. I have been thinking of making a change myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Manson could hardly believe his ears. He had entertained very small hope of effecting his purpose, and Mr. Bradford\u0027s ready acquiescence in his wishes filled him with delight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If I might venture the suggestion,\" he added, encouraged by his success, \"I should be glad if you would give the place to my nephew Julius.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know how Julius will suit me,\" said Mr. Bradford, \"but I will try him for a week.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At ten dollars a week?\" suggested Mr. Manson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At four dollars a week!\" replied the manufacturer, with emphasis. \"That is all boys of his age usually get. There were special reasons why I paid Paul more.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Manson was disappointed that Julius should be paid only ordinary boys\u0027 wages, but still it was a great[Pg 214] triumph to have Paul discharged, and Julius put in his place.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now,\" he said to himself, \"I\u0027ve the whip-hand of the young rascal. I\u0027ll pay him off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shall I tell him, sir, when he comes in?\" asked the book-keeper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I propose to tell him myself. Send him in to me when he gets back from his errand.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir, I will,\" promptly responded the book-keeper, resuming his own work with a satisfied smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ten minutes later Paul came in from the post office, bringing the afternoon mail.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83100.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:45 AM"}
