It really is Alexandrite Cat’s Eye. Why? Heaven, why do you mock me so, why did you let him have Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel!” she said with an ugly tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanging the topic was undoubtedly one of the best ways to quell anger, and Zhou Weiqing quickly seized the opportunity to ask softly: “Battalion Commander, what’s this Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel? How come I’ve never heard of it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said in a muttering manner: “Alexandrite, is a very special gemstone, belonging to the Chrysoberyl family of gems, under daylight it shows as a blue-green colour, the most beautiful of which would be the colour of emerald-jade. At night, under lamp or candle light, it appears to be rose-red or purplish red. As such, it is known as the emerald of the day, ruby of the night. In the world of gemstones, it is the rarest gemstone. And when the Alexandrite has the Cat’s Eye markings, it becomes an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel, and is the world’s most valuable gemstone, a hundred times more valuable than even diamonds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had never heard of Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewels, but as he examined it closely, sure enough its colour changed as the sun rose further, the dark blue colour slowly turning into a rich green, and the cat’s eye markings also seemed more obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean to say, this Elemental Jewel of mine is Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel? But, what attribute is that?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously, even momentarily forgetting the arrow at his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was still in a dazed mode, and she said: “Alexandrite being the Elemental Jewel can only happen to Heavenly Jewel Masters. Besides being of higher quality and having a stronger elemental attribute, there is also one more possibility for Heavenly Jewel Masters – to have multiple Elemental Attributes. When a Heavenly Jewel Master has 2 or more elemental attributes, then his Elemental Jewel will be an Alexandrite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing blinked and said, “Does that mean I have more than 2 elemental attributes? Isn’t that better than having a single attribute?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er raised her head slowly, the dazed look in her eyes vanished, replaced with a rather complicated look. She shook her head, and the arrow in her hand moved a little – the pain at his throat silencing Zhou Weiqing and causing him to shiver. “It’s not 2 or more attributes, but 4 or more attributes. Alexandrite Cat’s Eye is a legend amongst Elemental Jewels; when it appears it means that the Heavenly Jewel Master has more than 4 elemental attributes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked at Shangguan Bing’er, stupefied, and he started laughing, “I’m a legend?” Having been a trash for 13 years, yet suddenly turned into a Heavenly Jewel Master of legend, even though he was facing death, the sudden change still made this rascal proud of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er’s feelings now were extremely complicated. Even if Zhou Weiqing was just an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, she couldn’t kill him now. After she had chased him out of the tent, her emotions has settled a littl. She was clear that the events that occurred yesterday was truly an accident. When Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Jewels Awakened yesterday and he had required a Sacrifice, she had just happened to stumble in. According to what she knew, under that circumstance, Zhou Weiqing had lost control of himself and the usual result should have been her death. However, she managed to survive, which meant that Zhou Weiqing’s willpower was extremely firm, and had managed to hold back at the last second, sparing her life. Although he had committed a grave sin against her, but he had actually not been fully in the wrong. After all, he had not been conscious when doing so, and had been controlled by the Evil Attribute when his Heavenly Jewel Awakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut could she really just let it go like that? Shangguan Bing’er was really not reconciled, not willing to let the matter rest just like that. Which young girl did not dream of romance? In her heart, she had often daydreamed about what her future husband would be like, handsome, modest, gentle, upstanding moral character, preferably a Heavenly Jewel Master, a man who was deeply in love with her, and treated her and coddled her like she was precious. Only then would she give herself to him on their wedding night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, at this moment, all her daydreams and fantasies had evaporated, and her innocence had been ruined in such a muddled fashion by such a honest looking person who was actually so sly in nature, this rascal who had such an ordinary appearance. Not to talk about love between them, there was barely any affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really felt like ignoring everything and just killing him, but reason and logic told her that if she killed him just like that, she would never be able to reverse it. He was after all a Heavenly Jewel Master, and one with a legendary innate talent, having the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel! For her country, she could not kill him. In the future, he could possibly advance to one of top, or even possibly the top Heavenly Jewel Master in the whole Mainland. How could she just ruin such a future talent like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, Shangguan Bing’er tried her best to calm herself down, and she sharply withdrew the arrow in her hand, and shouted harshly: “Get lost, get out of my sight now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no more threat to his life, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt like he was granted amnesty. “I’m getting lost right now!” As he said that, he started running off toward the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wretch! Come back here, I asked you to get lost back to camp!!” Shangguan Bing’er saw that the rascal was trying to run away, and instantly got angry again. With a flying kick, she caused him to stagger, but also causing her own lower body to ache in pain. That rascal always seemed to make her angry so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing dropped his head down as if he were being wronged, “Don’t be angry, I’m going back to the camp now okay? I promise, no matter how much you trample on me, I won’t resist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust now, in that instance when Shangguan Bing’er drew back the arrow in her hand, Zhou Weiqing felt a strong stabbing pain in his heart, an extreme heartache. She was really too kind, he had treated her like that but she still spared his life. In that moment, Zhou Weiqing found that he had fallen for Shangguan Bing’er. If we were to say that previously, he felt unworthy of her, but now he would no longer have such a feeling. After all, he had also become a Heavenly Jewel Master, furthermore one with the legendary Alexandrite Cat’s Eye. He truly believed that if he worked hard in cultivating, one day he would be worthy of her, and he vowed silently that he would always take good care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, no matter what, Zhou Weiqing’s mind also always had some dirty thoughts. While he was deeply touched, this fellow was also thinking: \u003cem\u003eIf one day I bring Shangguan Bing’er home as my wife to show Dad, I wonder if that Dad of mine who never smiles would show any shocked expression.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at Zhou Weiqing leaving with a pitiable expression, Shangguan Bing’er suddenly seemed to collapse like a deflated balloon, and she sat down on the floor, the arrow dropping to the ground, and hugged her knees sobbing out loud. She had never been a particularly firm girl, and such a massive change and events caused her to be overwhelmed with emotion and to break down and cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had not gone very far, and hearing Shangguan Bing’er cry, he stopped in his tracks. He gingerly walked back, first taking up the arrow on the ground and throwing it further away, before carefully squatting down beside her. He did not know how to comfort her, and could only squat at the side in company. At the same time, he was thinking to himself: \u003cem\u003eShe is truly worthy of being called the top beauty in the Empire! Even when she’s crying she’s so beautiful!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-1-chapter-6-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-1-chapter-7-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-1-chapter-6-04","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
