They feared that I did not know how long I had slept, but I knew. Almost a hundred years had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the grand buildings of Imperial glory fallen to ruin, overrun with animals, and being used as quarries for those who came to take the stone. Huge statues had been toppled over and lay in the weeds. My old street was unrecognizable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the population had dwindled to no more than a few thousand souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, the Christians ministered to their own, and their virtue was most inspiring. And because the invaders had been in some cases Christians, many of the churches had gone unharmed. The Bishop of Rome sought to defend them against their overlords, and maintained strong ties with Constantinople, the city that ruled both East and West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the few old families who remained, there was only humiliation as they sought to serve their new barbarian masters, and to tell themselves that somehow the crude Goths and Vandals could acquire some polish and love of literature and some appreciation of Roman law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again I marveled at the pure resistance of Christianity, that it seemed to feed upon disaster as it had fed upon persecution, and as it prospered during interludes of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also marveled at the resilience of the old Patricians, who as I said, did not withdraw from public life, but strove to inculcate the old values as best they could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere one saw barbarians with mustaches, wearing crude trousers, their hair greasy and unkempt. Many were Arian Christians, holding different ceremonies from their \"orthodox\" Catholic brothers and sisters. What were they? Goths, Visigoths, Alemmani, Huns? Some I couldn\u0027t recognize at all. And the ruler of this great state lived not at Rome but at Ravenna in the North.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was also to discover that a new nest of the Satanic vampires had settled in a forgotten catacomb of the city, where they held ceremonies to their Serpent Devil before going out to prey upon the innocent and the guilty alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvicus and Mael, puzzled as to the origins of these new zealots, and most weary of them, had resolved to leave them alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walked through ruined streets and through empty houses, these zealot creatures spied upon me. I loathed them. But I hardly considered them a danger. In my starvation I had grown strong. Akasha\u0027s blood was in my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how wrong I was in my judgment upon the Satanic vampires, oh, how very wrong indeed. But I will come to that in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me return to those nights when I wandered the broken fragments of classical civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not as embittered by it as one might think. Indeed Akasha\u0027s blood had not only given me great new physical power, it had enhanced the clarity of my mind, my ability to concentrate, to take to myself what I prized, and to dismiss what was no longer good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless the state of Rome was demoralizing, and it was only likely to get worse. I looked to Constantinople to preserve what I called civilization and I was all too ready for the voyage ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it was time to help Avicus and Mael with the last preparations. And they assisted me in carefully wrapping the Divine Pair as mummies, with all reverence, and placing them in granite sarcophagi which no team of men could open, as had been done in the past by me, and would be done in the future every time that the Divine Parents had to be moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was most frightening for Avicus and Mael\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;to see the pair moved and then so completely covered with the white strips of linen. They knew nothing of the old prayers in Egyptian which I recited, which were charms for the safety of the journey scavenged from my years of reading, and I don\u0027t think this comforted them. But the Divine Couple were my concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I moved to wrap the eyes of Akasha, she closed them, and with Enkil there occurred the same thing. What a strange and momentary indication of consciousness. It sent a chill through me. Yet still I went about my duty, as if I were an old Egyptian wrapping a deceased Pharaoh in the Sacred House of the Dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Mael and Avicus accompanied me down to Ostia, the port from which we would sail, and we boarded the vessel, having the Divine Parents placed below deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the slaves that Avicus and Mael had purchased I found them most impressive, all handpicked and excellent even to the galley slaves who knew that they worked for future freedom in the East and rich rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong band of soldiers were to sail with us, each heavily armed, highly skilled and quite convinced of the same promise, and I was particularly impressed by the captain of this vessel, a Christian Roman by the name of Clement, a man of cleverness and wit, who would maintain the faith of the others in the final rewards as we made the long voyage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship itself was the largest galley I had ever beheld, with an immense and colorful sail, and it contained a massive and impregnable cabin containing three long chests modestly made of bronze and iron in which Mael, Avicus and I would sleep by day. These chests, like the sarcophagi, were impossible for mortals to open without enormous difficulty and also they were far too heavy for even a gang of men to lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last everything was in readiness, and armed to the teeth against pirates, we set out by night, guiding the ship with our supernatural eyes from floundering on any rocks as we moved swiftly along the coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis frightened our crew and our soldiery somewhat as can be imagined, for in those times ships almost invariably proceeded only by day. It was too dangerous for them to do otherwise, for they couldn\u0027t see the coast or the rocky islands they might encounter, and even though they might have good maps and skilled navigators, there was still the danger of a dreadful accident occurring in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reversed this age-old wisdom, and by day, our ship was in port so that those who served us might enjoy what the local town had to offer, and our slaves and soldiers were made all the more happy by this, and all the more devoted, while the captain kept a firm grip by allowing only some to go ashore at certain times, and insisting that some remain and keep watch or sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways we woke and emerged from our cabin to find our servants in high good humor, musicians playing under the moon for the soldiers, and Clement, the captain, delightfully drunk. There was no suspicion among them that we were other than three extremely bizarre human beings of immense wealth. Indeed, sometimes I eavesdropped on their theories about us\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that we were Magi from the Far East like unto the Three Kings who had come to lay gifts before the Christ Child* and I was most amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur only real problem was an absurd one. We had to ask for meals to be brought to us, and then to dispense with the food through the windows of our cabin, directly into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sent us into peals of laughter, yet I found it undignified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did periodically spend a night on shore so that we might feed. Our years had given us great skill in this matter. And we might even have starved for the entire journey, but this we chose not to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for our camaraderie aboard the ship, it was most interesting to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was living more closely with mortals than ever before. I talked with our captain and our soldiers by the hour. And I found I enjoyed it tremendously, and I was very much relieved that, in spite of my very pale skin, it was so easy to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself passionately attracted to our Captain Clement. I enjoyed the tales of his youth spent on merchant ships throughout the Mediterranean, and he amused me with descriptions of the ports he\u0027d visited, some of which I had known hundreds of years before, and some of which were wholly new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sadness was lifted as I listened to Clement. I saw the world through his eyes, and knew his hope. I looked forward to a lively household in Constantinople where he could call upon me as his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother great change had taken place. I was now definitely an intimate companion to both Avicus and Mael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany a night we spent alone in the cabin, with the full wine cups before us, talking about all that had occurred in Italy and other things as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvicus was of a keen mind as I had always imagined him to be, eager for learning and reading, and had over the centuries taught himself both Latin and Greek. But there was much he didn\u0027t understand about my world and its old piety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had with him histories by Tacitus, and Livy, and also the True Tales of Lucian, and the biographies written in Greek by Plutarch; but he was not able to understand this work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent many happy hours reading aloud to him as he followed along with me, explaining to him how the text could be interpreted. And I saw in him a great absorption of information. He wanted to know the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael did not share this spirit; but he was no longer against it as he had been a very long time ago. He listened to all we discussed, and perhaps he profited somewhat from it. It was plain to me that the two\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf; Avicus and Mael\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;survived as blood drinkers because of each other. But Mael no longer regarded me with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for me, I rather enjoyed the role of teacher, and it gave me new pleasure to argue with Plutarch as if he were in the room with me, and to comment on Tacitus as if he were there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Avicus and Mael had grown paler and stronger with time. Each had, he confessed, at some moment or other felt the threat of despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the sight of you, asleep in the shrine,\" Mael said without enmity, \"that kept me from going down into some cellar and resigning myself to the same slumber. I felt I should never awake from it, and Avicus, my companion Avicus, would not allow me to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Avicus had felt weary of the world and unable to continue, it had been Mael who kept him from the fatal sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth had suffered extreme anguish over my condition, and during the long decades when I lay unresponsive to their pleas, they had been too afraid of the Noble Parents to lay before them flowers, or to burn incense or to do anything to tend the shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We feared they would strike out at us,\" said Avicus. \"Even to look at their faces filled us with dread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded to all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Divine Parents,\" I said, \"have never showed a need of those things. I am the author of such devotions. Darkness may please them as well as burning lamps. Look how they slumber now in their wrappings and in their coffins, side by side beneath the deck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt emboldened by the visions I had had to say these things, though I never spoke of those visions or bragged that I had drunk the Sacred Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while we sailed there was the prospect of one great horror which hung over the three of us\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that our ship might be attacked either by day or night, and that the Divine Parents might be sunk into the sea. It was far too awful for us to talk of it, and that, perhaps, is why we did not. And whenever I brooded over this, I realized that we should have taken the safer route over land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in the small hours a terrible truth became known to me\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that if we did meet disaster, I might rise from the sea, and Those Who Must Be Kept might not. In the mysterious bottom of the great ocean what would become of these Parents? My agony of mind grew too great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put aside my anguish. I continued the pleasant talk with my companions. I went out on deck and looked upon the silvery sea and sent my love to Pandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeantime I did not share the enthusiasm of Mael and Avicus for Byzantium. I had lived in Antioch a long time ago, and Antioch was an Eastern city but with great Western influence, and I had left it to return to Rome, for I was a child of the West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we were heading to what I thought to be a purely Eastern capital, and I was afraid that in its great vitality I would find only what I could not possibly embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne must understand: from the Roman point of view, the East\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf; that is, the lands of Asia Minor and Persia\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;had always been suspect, for their emphasis on luxury and their general softness. It was believed by me and by many Romans that Persia had softened Alexander the Great thereby softening Greek culture. Then Greek culture with its Persian influence had softened Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course immense culture and art had come with this softening. Romans embraced Greek knowledge of all sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, I felt, deep in my soul, this age-old suspicion of the East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally I said nothing to Avicus and Mael. Their enthusiasm for this mighty seat of the Eastern Emperor was something not to be spoilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last after our long voyage, we came early one evening into the shimmering Sea of Marmara and beheld the high ramparts of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstantinople with their myriad torches, and for the first time, I understood the glory of the peninsula which Constantine had chosen so long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly our ship made its way into the magnificent harbor. And I was chosen to be the one to use his \"magic\" upon the officials of the dock to arrange our arrival and give us time within the port to find some proper lodgings before removing the sacred cargo which we carried, the sarcophagi of venerable ancestors brought back to be buried in their native land. Of course we had mundane questions as to where we might find an agent to help us with our lodgings, and more than one mortal was called to give us advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a matter of gold and the Spell Gift, and I had no difficulty. And soon we were onshore and ready to explore this mythic place where God had directed Constantine to create the greatest city in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot say I was disappointed that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first extraordinary surprise was that the merchants of Constantinople were required to put up torches outside their shops so that the streets were beautifully illuminated. And we at once realized that there was a wilderness of great churches for us to explore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city held some million inhabitants, and I sensed at once an immense vigor that had gone out of Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went immediately\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;leading my two agreeable companions with me\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;to the great open square called the Augusteum, and where I could gaze on the facade of Hagia Sophia\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;the Church of the Holy Wisdom\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;and upon other immense and regal buildings including the splendid public baths of Zeuxippus, which had been decorated with beautifully executed pagan statues taken from various cities of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to go in all directions at the same time. For here lay the great Hippodrome in which by day thousands witnessed chariot races which were the passion of the populace, and there the indescribably huge and complex royal palace into which we could easily have crept without being seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great street led westward from this square, and constituted the main thoroughfare of the city, in that there were other squares which opened off it, and also other streets, which fed, of course, innumerable lanes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael and Avicus continued to follow me politely as I led them hither and thither, and into the interior of Hagia Sophia to stand between its magnificent walls and beneath its immense dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was overcome by the beauty of the church with its myriad arches and the high ornate and detailed mosaics of Justinian and Theodora which were unbelievably splendid and glittering in the light of countless lamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the nights to come, there would be no end of splendid adventures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy comrades might tire of this, but I would not. I would penetrate the Imperial Court very soon, using my swiftness and cleverness to go about the palace. And for better or for worse I was in a city that was thriving where I would know the comfort of the proximity of many many human souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the weeks that followed we purchased for ourselves a splendid house, quite well fortified, its garden entirely enclosed, and made for ourselves a secret and safe crypt beneath the mosaic floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Divine Parents, I was adamant that they must be hidden some distance from the city. I had already heard plenty about the riots in Constantinople and I wanted the chapel to be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever I could find no old vaults or tombs in the countryside like the old Etruscan tomb I had used outside of Rome. And finally I had no choice but to have a sanctuary built beneath our house by a gang of slaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis unnerved me. In Antioch and in Rome, I had created the chapels. Now I must rely upon others. At last I pursued an intricate plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI designed a series of overlapping passages leading deep down to a large chamber which would require anyone going there to turn first right, then left, then right, then left again with exceedingly debilitating affect. Then I set pairs of heavy bronze doors at certain intervals, each pair having a heavy bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thick stone blocking the entrance to this winding and doubling passage was not only disguised as part of the mosaic flooring of the house, but was, as I so often say when describing such things, far too heavy for even a team of mortals to lift. Even the iron grips were so numerous and intricately designed as to seem part of the ornamentation of the overall floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael and Avicus thought all this quite extreme, but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey approved, however, when I had the walls of the chapel covered with gold mosaic of the very kind I saw in all the splendid churches, and the floor laid with the finest marble tile. A broad and gorgeous throne of hammered gold was prepared for the Royal Couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lamps were hung from the ceiling on chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was all this work done, you might ask, without compromising the secret of the underground chamber? Did I murder all those who had participated in the creation of this chapel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It was by use of the Spell Gift to confuse those brought to their labor, and by the use at times of simple blindfolds of which the slaves and even the artists could not complain. Gilded words as to \"lovers and brides\" smoothed over any mortal objections. And money did the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last came the night when I must take the Royal Parents to their chapel. Avicus and Mael politely confessed that they thought I would want to do this alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no objections. Like a powerful Christian Angel of Death, I carried first one sarcophagus and then the other down to the fine chapel and set them side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the linen wrappings from Akasha first, holding her in my arms as I knelt on the floor. Her eyes were closed. Then quite suddenly, she opened them, looking past me, her expression meaningless and simple as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I felt a curious deadening disappointment. But I whispered prayers to her to conceal it, as I cleaned away the linen and lifted her, and carried her, my silent bride, and seated her on the throne. There she rested, her clothes rumpled and incomplete, blind as ever, as I took the wrappings from Enkil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came the same strange moment when his eyes opened as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dared say nothing aloud to him. I lifted him, found him more pliant, and even almost light, and placed him on the throne beside his queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral nights passed before I could complete their raiment, but it must look perfect to the memories I still had of fine Egyptian garments, and then I sought to locate for them new and interesting jewels. Constantinople was full of such luxuries, and the craftsmen who dealt in them. All of this I did alone and with no difficulty, praying all the while in the most respectful tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the chapel was even more beautiful than the first one which I had made in Antioch, and far more lovely than that which had existed outside of Rome. I put in place the usual braziers in which I would burn incense, and I filled the many hanging lamps with sweet-smelling oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when all this was done did I go back to the matter of the new city, and how things were to be in it, and whether or not Akasha and Enkil were truly safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was very uneasy. I didn\u0027t even know the city yet, I realized. I was preoccupied. I wanted to continue visiting the churches and feasting off the beauty of the city; but I did not know whether or not we were the only vampires here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed extremely doubtful to me. After all, there were other blood drinkers in existence. Why wouldn\u0027t they come to the most beautiful city in the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Greek quality of Constantinople, I didn\u0027t like it. I am rather ashamed to say it, but it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like that the populace spoke Greek instead of Latin, though I myself could speak Greek very well, of course. And I didn\u0027t like all the Christian monasteries in which there seemed a deep mysticism that was more Oriental than Western.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art I found everywhere was impressive, yes, but it was losing all ties to the classical art of Greece and Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew statues presented men as stocky and crude with very round heads. Eyes were bulbous, faces without expression. And the Ikons or Holy Pictures which had become so common were highly stylized, with scowling faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the splendid mosaics of Justinian and Theodora\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;the figures in their long robes floating against the walls of the church\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;were rigid and dreamlike rather than classical, or beautiful according to standards that I had not learnt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a magnificent place but it was not my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, there was something inherently repulsive in the gigantic royal palace with its eunuchs and its slaves. When I crept into it and roamed about, visiting its throne rooms, audience halls, gorgeous chapels, immense dining room, and many bedchambers, I saw the licentiousness of Persia, and though I couldn\u0027t blame anyone for it, I felt ill at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the population, though it was huge and vital, could brawl in the streets over the outcome of the chariot races in the Hippodrome, or riot in the very churches, killing one another, over matters of religion as well. In fact, the endless religious quarrels bordered on sheer madness. And doctrinal differences kept the entire Empire in upheaval most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the problems of the Empire\u0027s borders they were as continuous as they had been in the time of the Caesars. The Persians perpetually threatened the East and there was simply no end to the barbarians who poured down into the Empire from the West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving long identified my own soul with the salvation of the Empire, I felt no consolation in this city. I felt suspicion and profound distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did however often roam into Santa Sophia to marvel at the enormous dome which seemed to float above with no means of support. Something ineffable had been captured in that grand church which could humble the most proud spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvicus and Mael were quite happy in this new city. And both seemed absolutely determined that I be their leader, and as I shopped the marketplace for books in the evening, Avicus was eager to join me, and eager for me to read to him what I found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeantime I furnished our house comfortably, and hired artisans to paint the walls. I did not want to become lost in my painted gardens again, and when I thought of my lost Pandora my anguish was worse even than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed I searched for Pandora. I told Avicus and Mael a few little stories, harmless and unimportant, of my nights with her, but principally of how I had loved her, so that images of her might exist in their minds in so far as they had the power to keep such images alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Pandora roamed these streets, if she came upon my companions perhaps she could divine from them that I was here and wanted so desperately to be reunited with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once I began to acquire a library, buying whole caskets of scrolls and going through them at my leisure. I set up a fine writing desk and began a rather neutral and impersonal diary of my adventures in the old code I had invented before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had been in Constantinople less than six months when it became clear to us that other blood drinkers were coming near to our house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe heard them in the early morning. They came, apparently to hear of us what they could with the Mind Gift and then they rushed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why have they taken so long?\" I demanded. \"They\u0027ve watched us and they\u0027ve studied us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And perhaps they are the reason,\" said Avicus, \"that we\u0027ve found no Devil worshipers here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was perhaps true, for those who spied on us now were not Devil worshipers. We could tell by the bits and pieces of mental imagery which we were able to glean from their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last they came at early evening and there was no mistaking their polite invitation to us to come with them to visit their mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went out of our house to greet them and discovered that there were two of them and that they were pale and beautiful boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn\u0027t have been more than thirteen when they were made, and they had very clear dark eyes, and had short curly black hair. They were dressed in long Eastern robes of the finest decorated cloth, trimmed in a fringe of red and gold. Their under tunics were of silk, and they wore ornate slippers and many jeweled rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo mortals carried the torches for them, and they appeared to be simple and expensive Persian slaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the radiant young blood drinker boys placed a small scroll in my hands, which I at once opened to read the beautifully written Greek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the custom before hunting my city to ask permission of me,\" it said. \"Please come to my palace.\" It was signed, \"Eudoxia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not care for the style of this any more than I had cared for the style of anything else in Constantinople. And I cannot say that it surprised me, but then here was an opportunity to speak with other blood drinkers who were not the fanatical worshipers of the Snake and that opportunity had never come before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso allow me to note that in all my years as a blood drinker, I had not seen any two others who were as fine and elegant and beautiful as these boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt the groups of Satan worshipers contained such blood drinkers, with fine faces and innocent eyes, but for the large part, as I have described, it was Avicus and Mael who slew them or came to terms with them, not me. Besides they had always been corrupted by their zeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something else here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese boys seemed infinitely more interesting by virtue of their dignity and their adornments, and the courage with which they looked at me. As for the name Eudoxia, I was ultimately more curious than afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go with you,\" I said immediately. But the boys gestured that Avicus and Mael should come as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is this?\" I asked protectively. But at once my companions let me know that they wanted to go too. \"How many are you?\" I asked the boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eudoxia will answer your questions,\" said the boy who had given me the scroll. \"Please do come with us without further conversation. Eudoxia has been hearing of you for some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were escorted a long way through the streets, until finally we came to a quarter of the city even richer than that in which we lived, and to a house much larger even than our own. It had the usual harsh stone facade, enclosing no doubt an inner garden and rich rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, the boy blood drinkers cloaked their thoughts very well, but I was able to divine, perhaps because they wanted me to do, that their names were Asphar and Rashid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were admitted to the house by another pair of mortal slaves who guided us into a large chamber completely decorated with gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorches burned all about us, and in the center of the room, on a gilded couch with purple silk pillows there reclined a gorgeous blood drinker woman, with thick black curls not unlike those of the boys who had come to us, though she wore them long and fretted with pearls, her damask robe and under dress of silk as fine as anything I\u0027d seen in Constantinople so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was small, oval, and as close to perfection as anything I\u0027ve ever beheld, even though she bore no resemblance to Pandora who was for me perfection itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were round and extremely large. Her lips were perfectly rouged, and there came a perfume from her that was no doubt made by a Persian magician to drive us out of our wits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were numerous chairs and couches scattered about on the mosaic floor where rampant Grecian goddesses and gods were as tastefully represented as they might have been some five hundred years before. I saw similar images on the walls surrounding us, though the slightly crude but ornate columns seemed of later design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the vampire woman\u0027s skin it was perfectly white, and so totally without a touch of humanity that it sent a chill through me. But her expression, which manifested itself almost entirely by a smile, was cordial and curious in the extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill leaning on her elbow, her arm covered in bracelets, she looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius,\" she said in cultured and perfect Latin, her voice as lovely as her face, \"you read my walls and floor as though they were a book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me,\" I said. \"But when a room is so exquisitely decorated, it seems the polite thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you long for old Rome,\" she said, \"or for Athens, or even for Antioch where you once lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a formidable blood drinker. She\u0027d plucked this knowledge of me from the deepest of my memories. I closed my mind. But I didn\u0027t close my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Eudoxia,\" she said. \"I wish I could say that I bid you welcome to Constantinople, but it is my city and I am not altogether pleased that you are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we not come to some understanding with you?\" I asked. \"We\u0027ve made a long and arduous journey. The city is vast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made some small gesture, and the mortal slaves withdrew. Only Asphar and Rashid remained, as if waiting for her command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to tell if there were other blood drinkers in this house, but I couldn\u0027t do this without her knowing I was doing it, and so my attempt was rather weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, all of you, please,\" she said. And at that invitation, the two beautiful boys, Asphar and Rashid, made to bring the couches in closer so that we might gather in a natural way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once I asked if I might have a chair. And Avicus and Mael in an uncertain whisper echoed the same request. It was done. We were seated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An old Roman,\" she said with a sudden luminous smile. \"You disdain a couch, and would have a chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed a small courteous laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then something quite invisible yet strong caused me to cast a glance at Avicus and to see that he was staring at this splendid female blood drinker as though Cupid had just sent an arrow right into his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Mael, he glared at her as he had glared at me in Rome many centuries before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about your friends,\" said Eudoxia suddenly, startling me completely. \"They\u0027re loyal to you and will follow you in whatever you say. It\u0027s you and I who must talk now. Understand that though this city is immense and there is blood enough for many, rogue blood drinkers come here often and must be driven away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we rogues? \" I asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but study her features, her rounded chin with its single dimple, and her small cheeks. She appeared as young in mortal years as the two boys. As for her eyes they were jet black, with such a fringe of lashes that one might suspect there was Egyptian paint on her face when in fact there was none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis observation put me suddenly in mind of Akasha, and I felt a panic as I tried to clear my mind. What had I done bringing Those Who Must Be Kept here? I should have stayed in the ruins of Rome. But again, I could not think on this matter now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked directly at Eudoxia, a bit dazzled by the countless jewels of her robe, and the vision of her sparkling fingernails, far brighter than any I\u0027d ever beheld except those of Akasha, and I gathered my strength again and tried to penetrate her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sweetly at me, and then she said, \"Marius, I am far too old in the Blood for what you mean to do, but I will tell you anything you want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I call you by the name you\u0027ve given us?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was my intent,\" she replied, \"in giving you the name. But let me tell you, I expect honesty from you; otherwise, I will not tolerate you in my realm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt a wave of anger emanating from Mael. I threw a warning glance to him, and once again I saw that totally entranced expression on the face of Avicus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized suddenly that Avicus had probably never beheld such a blood drinker as this. The young women blood drinkers among the worshipers of Satan were deliberately dirty and disheveled, and here, reclining on her magnificent couch lay a woman who looked like the Empress who reigned over Byzantium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, perhaps this was how this creature perceived herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as though all these thoughts were transparent to her, and then with a little movement of her hand she told the two blood drinker boys, Asphar and Rashid, to withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her eyes passed very calmly and slowly over my two companions as though she were drawing from them every single coherent thought which had ever passed through their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued my study of her, of the pearls in her hair, and the ropes of pearls about her neck, and the jewels that adorned her naked toes as well as her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, she looked to me, and a smile spread itself once more on her features, brightening her entire countenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I grant you permission to stay\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;and I am not at all sure that I mean to do it\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;you must show me loyalty when others come to break the peace that we share. You must never side with them against me. You must keep Constantinople only for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just what will you do if we don\u0027t show you loyalty?\" asked Mael with his old anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained staring at me for a long moment, as though to insult him, and then as though rousing herself from a spell, she looked at Mael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do,\" she asked Mael, \"to silence you before you say something foolish again?\" Then her eyes returned to me. \"Let me make this known to you all. I know that you possess the Mother and the Father. I know that you brought them here for safekeeping and that they are in a chapel deep beneath your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was brutally stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a wave of grief. Once again, I had failed to keep the secret. Even in Antioch long ago, I had failed to keep the secret. Would I not always fail to keep the secret? Was this not my fate? What was to be done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so quick to draw back from me, Marius,\" said Eudoxia. \"I drank from the Mother in Egypt centuries before you took her away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis statement stunned me all the more. Yet it held some strange promise. It cast a small light into my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wondrously excited suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere was one who understood everything about the ancient mysteries, just as Pandora had understood. This one, delicate of face and speech, was a world apart from either Avicus or Mael, and how gentle and reasonable she seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you my story if you want it, Marius,\" she said. \"I have always been a worldly blood drinker, never one given to the old religion of the Blood Gods of Egypt. I was three hundred years old in the Blood before you were born. But I\u0027ll tell you all you want to know. It is plain that you move through the world by means of questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"I do move through the world by means of questions, and too often I\u0027ve asked those questions in utter silence, or long centuries ago of people who gave me answers that were fragments which I had to piece together as though they were bits of old papyri. I hunger for knowledge. I hunger for what you mean to say to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and this seemed to give her extraordinary pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of us don\u0027t require intimate understanding,\" she said. \"Do you require it, Marius? I can read much in your thoughts, but this is a puzzle. Must you be understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was baffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must I be understood,\" I said, thinking it over, as secretly as I might. Did either Avicus or Mael understand me? No, they did not. But once long long ago the Mother had understood me. Or had she? Just possibly when I\u0027d fallen so in love with her, I had understood her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have an answer for you,\" I said softly. \"I think I have come to enjoy loneliness. I think when I was mortal I loved it. I was the wanderer. But why do you put this question to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t require understanding,\" she said, and for the first time there came a cold tone into her voice. \"But if you wish it, I\u0027ll tell you about my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want so much to hear your story,\" I answered. I was infatuated. Again, I thought of my beautiful Pandora. Here was an incomparable woman who seemed to have the same gifts. I wanted so to listen to her, and it was more than essential for our safety that I listen to her. But how could we deal with the uneasiness of Mael, and the obvious obsession of Avicus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the thought from me immediately, looking at Avicus gently and then turning her attention for a long sober moment on the infuriated Mael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a priest in Gaul,\" she said calmly to him, \"yet you have the attitude of a dedicated warrior. You would destroy me. Why is this so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t respect your authority here,\" Mael answered, trying to match her quiet tone. \"Who are you to me? You say you never respected the old religion. Well, I respected it. And Avicus respected it. Of this we\u0027re proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all want the same thing,\" she answered. She smiled, revealing her fang teeth. \"We want a hunting ground which is not overcrowded. We want the Satanic blood drinkers to be kept out for they multiply insanely and seek to foment trouble in the mortal world. My authority rests on my past triumphs. It\u0027s no more than habit. If we can make a peace...\" She broke off and in the manner of a man she shrugged her shoulders and opened her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Avicus broke in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius speaks for us,\" he said. \"Marius, make the peace with Eudoxia, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We give you our loyalty,\" I said, \"in so far as we do want the same things, as you\u0027ve described. But I want very much to speak with you. I want to know how many blood drinkers are here now. As for your history, let me say again that I do want to hear it. One thing we can give to each other is our history. Yes. I want to know yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose from the couch very gracefully, revealing herself to be a little taller than I had supposed. She had rather broad shoulders for a woman, and she walked very straight, her bare feet not making the slightest sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come into my library,\" she said, leading us into a chamber off the main room. \"It\u0027s better for talking, I believe.\" Her hair was long down her back, a heavy mass of black curls, and she moved gracefully despite the weight of her beaded and decorated robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe library was immense, with shelves for scrolls and codexes, that is, bound volumes such as we have today. There were chairs here and there, and some gathered in the center, and two couches for reclining and tables on which to write. The golden lamps looked Persian to me in their heavy worked designs, but I couldn\u0027t be certain of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carpets strewn about were definitely Persian, that much I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the moment I saw the books, I was overcome with pleasure. This always happens with me. I remembered the library in old Egypt in which I had found the Elder who had put the Mother and Father into the sun. I feel foolishly safe with books which can be a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of all that I had lost in the first siege of Rome. I couldn\u0027t help but wonder what Greek and Roman authors were here preserved. For the Christians, though they were kinder to the ancients than people now believe, did not always save the old works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your eyes are hungry,\" she said, \"though your mind is shut. I know you want to read here. You\u0027re welcome. Send your scribes to copy what you will. But I go ahead of myself, don\u0027t I? We must talk. We must see if we can achieve an agreement. I don\u0027t know that we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her eyes to Avicus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, you who are old, you who were given the Blood in Egypt, you are only just learning to love the realm of letters. How strange that it would take you so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel his immense excitement and tender confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m learning,\" he said. \"Marius is teaching me.\" And then the flame rose in his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Mael, I couldn\u0027t help but note his quiet fury, and it struck me that he had for so long been the author of his own unhappiness, but now something was truly happening which might be a legitimate cause of his pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it greatly distressed me that neither of them could keep their minds secret. Long ago in Rome when I had sought to find them they had done a better job of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s be seated,\" said Eudoxia, \"and let me tell you who I am.\" We took the chairs, which brought us closer together, and she began to tell her story in a quiet tone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-9.html","bookId":2594,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM"}
