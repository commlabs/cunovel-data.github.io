{"id":92257,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eJessica burst into Montresse House, terrified that everything had gone wrong, that the Master had come and called out to Mary, who was still under his thrall, and had been unable to fight back, even with Gareth\u0027s help. Jeremy and Nancy would have been useless, and against the Master, what hope could Stacey and Gareth have had?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGareth was at the front door. He stared at her with concern, then slowly arched a brow. She knew why. She never returned to her own house in leather, lace and latex. Tonight, however, she had been in far too great a hurry to worry about a costume change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The others...they\u0027re all right?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, looking perplexed. \"Of course. You were the one at the party. The Master-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Master didn\u0027t show,\" she said briefly. With disbelief, she added, \"He didn\u0027t come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s fine,\" he assured her. \"I was down here most of the night, but I just checked upstairs. Stacey and Jeremy are awake-and Mary, of course. Nancy is sleeping like a babe in arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Jessica started up the stairs. She heard Gareth setting the locks again in her wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she had ordered, Mary was confined to one small area, encircled by bowls of holy water, strings of garlic and crosses. She was apparently comfortable enough; they\u0027d provided her with a pillow and blanket, and plenty of O-positive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey and Jeremy were seated across the room from her, wide awake. As soon as he saw her, Jeremy leapt to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica!\" he cried with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey, too, jumped up. \"Jessica...thank God you\u0027re here. But you look like hell. What happened? Is he...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica shook her head. \"Tonight was a setup,\" she said flatly. She walked in, then sank down on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy was still, staring at her. \"My God,\" he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had forgotten that Jeremy hadn\u0027t known that she was the dominatrix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never saw the Master?\" Stacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He never showed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re...pretty beat-up,\" Stacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Stacey quickly became her efficient self. \"A shower is in order. I\u0027ll tell Gareth to make you something to eat. It\u0027s nearly dawn. Nothing else is going to happen tonight-I hope. And you have to get some rest. And soon...\" Her eyes moved to Mary, looking angelic inside her strange prison. \"Soon Mary will sleep. Then we\u0027ll have to-\" She broke off with a startled scream. The bedside phone had started to ring. \"I routed all calls in here,\" she explained. \"But who the hell would be calling now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it,\" Jessica assured her. She rolled over and picked up. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica? Thank God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as the sun rises, get over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, what\u0027s happened?\" Her heart sank. \"It\u0027s the Master, isn\u0027t it? What did he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you about it as soon as you come over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Wait till it\u0027s light. He\u0027s still out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica winced, tightening her fingers around the phone. \"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two,\" Maggie said softly. \"They were found with their throats slit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie hesitated, took a deep breath, then said, \"The hospital. They were cops. Jessica, stay there till sunrise, do you hear me? I swear, I won\u0027t tell you anything if you don\u0027t listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you soon, Maggie.\" She hung up. Stacey was staring at her. \"Well, I know where he was tonight,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hospital. He killed two cops. That\u0027s all I know so far. I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to change before you go out again,\" Stacey told her. \"Get in the shower-quickly. It\u0027s nearly dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" She started toward the bathroom, then froze. She should go now. Bryan MacAllistair was out there somewhere, as well. Would he come here? Would he believe her if she told him what was going on? Worse than that...could he possibly be...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButif he was, did he know that she...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause hewould have killed her already if he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how long would it take him to figure it out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Bryan brought the girl to the hospital, he saw the police cars and commotion going on. There were already news crews prowling the perimeter. And despite the fact it wasn\u0027t quite daylight, people were beginning to appear on the street, anxious to know what had happened. With that much of a crowd, there were rumors in abundance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had shed the old coat that held his weapons, then hung around after he set the unconscious girl down in the emergency room to make sure an orderly found her quickly and called for a doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drug overdose,\" he heard someone say wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was going to be all right. He could go outside and grill the lookie-loos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" he asked the people around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one really knows yet,\" an anxious matron told him. \"Someone said a couple of cops were viciously killed. Someone else said they got in a fight and killed each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, a girl, hugging her arms around her chest, offered, \"They say they were nearly decapitated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan had a feeling there was only one way to get close to the scene. He walked around the growing crowd and found a place where a group of uniformed cops were hovering, waiting for orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole thing is creepy. First there was that corpse that disappeared,\" one officer grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw the corpse,\" another cop said bitterly. \"Two of our own are dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first cop said, \"Do you believe what they\u0027re saying? That they killed each other? Santini couldn\u0027t ever stand to hurt a perp when he cuffed him. How the hell could he have gone after Clark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Clark went after him,\" a third cop said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fourth chimed in then. \"It\u0027s bullshit. It\u0027s all bullshit. How the hell could theyboth have their throats slit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought on a real silence. The first cop sighed. \"I\u0027ve got to find a john.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been leaning on his patrol car; now he straightened and headed toward a staff entrance to the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan followed him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridors were empty. Bryan followed the officer down a hall with a sign that bore a number of arrows. One pointed to \"Out-patient radiation, vending machines, billing and restrooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to let the man pee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited. When the cop came out of the bathroom, Bryan caught him with a quick blow. He fell without so much as a whimper. Bryan dragged him back into the restroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, buddy. I just need the uniform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, he found crime-scene tape blocking off the room. Pretending to ask about his assignment, he got close to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn\u0027t moved the bodies yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You there. Harrison,\" a big cop called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir?\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing up here? You\u0027re supposed to be downstairs. They\u0027ll be assigning you to crowd patrol soon. The mayor is going to be giving a statement, and things might get ugly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir. Sorry. I was told I should report to you...Sergeant Mendez,\" Bryan said, reading the man\u0027s badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Mendez, who stared back, fingering the crucifix around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange look entered Mendez\u0027s eyes; he crossed himself. \"You\u0027re not Harrison,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not,\" he said, keeping eye contact. \"But I need to see the bodies,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-you shouldn\u0027t be impersonating a cop,\" Mendez said, but there was no conviction in his words, and he stepped aside to let Bryan pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to block the hallway,\" Bryan said. \"Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mendez replied tonelessly, then stood firmly in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan saw that a reporter had just slipped in, and everyone was busy keeping him at bay. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved quickly, surveyed the bed, then the bodies. He knelt beside them, checking them out thoroughly. He saw the scalpels. The blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he saw the smudge in the blood where something had been written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed, then rose quickly, slipping out past the still-dazed Mendez and the crowd holding off the reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he left the building-through the front doors this time-he saw a number of cops again and frowned. He recognized one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Munro. The cop Stacey was dating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica reached Maggie\u0027s house just a few minutes after daylight. The children were still sleeping. Maggie looked as if she\u0027d been pacing for a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell happened last night?\" Jessica demanded. \"Two cops dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, made to look as if they\u0027d gotten into a fight and killed each other. But no way could two guys have slit each other\u0027s throats like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw them?\" Jessica asked weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Sean described the scene. And it wasn\u0027t any newborn creature seeking a meal, I can assure you. The Master was there. In the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were conned tonight. He set it up perfectly. The would-be vampires, the real thing, the old house...But the whole thing was a ploy. It\u0027s as if...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s as if it\u0027s been planned from the start,\" Maggie said. \"He\u0027s found you. All these years, all the deception, the elaborate masquerade you set up yourself, and he\u0027s found you, anyway, and wants to show you his power, make you suffer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To have discovered I was in New Orleans, practicing psychology, to have found out about a conference, found out I was going, then planned the party, knowing I\u0027d come....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s had years to plan all the revenge he wanted,\" Maggie reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why bother?\" Jessica murmured, but she knew the answer. Because he hated her with a passion that had outlasted centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what happened? You were there, you staked a bunch of the bad guys...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less,\" Jessica murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Bryan make an appearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you were the dominatrix?\" Maggie demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he didn\u0027t try to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God. You didn\u0027t killhim . You didn\u0027t kill a warrior, did you?\" Maggie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We came to an impasse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stared at her for a long moment. \"Kitchen,\" she said. \"There\u0027s coffee on.\" She held her peace until they were in the kitchen, until she had poured coffee. Jessica took her cup to the table and sat in silence. Maggie joined her. \"All right. Now, what the hell happened? In detail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was waiting to capture the Master in his performance room. I\u0027d...\u0027entertained\u0027 a few vampires while I was waiting, someone was there already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was still no Master, but then the feasting began downstairs. There were screams. We both ran down, fought...them, then each other, and then...we talked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just stopped fighting and youtalked? \" Maggie asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward intently. \"Jessica, Bryan is the king\u0027s warrior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just...I just can\u0027t believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, you can\u0027t believe it? You were lovers once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost a thousand years ago,\" Jessica protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie looked at her dryly. \"Since you\u0027ve only indulged in an affair every couple of hundred years, you should be able to recognize the one great love of your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stood, started to pace, then stopped, spun, set her hands on the table and stared at Maggie. \"If he is...\" She paused, wincing. \"If hewas Ioin MacDuncan, why didn\u0027t I hear hundreds of years ago that he was alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever said warriors were actually alive?\" Maggie asked. \"You know all about life without life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Existence,\" Jessica said. But Bryan is alive. He\u0027s no angel. He\u0027s flesh and blood and fire.Alive .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe in a way,\" Maggie conceded. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never known a warrior before. But then, I didn\u0027t even spend two hundred years as a vampire, and I\u0027ve never heard of anyone other than myself who\u0027s been bitten, then recovered more than a century later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica sat down again, deflated. \"I don\u0027t know. He knowswhat I am. He doesn\u0027t knowwho .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just going to have to tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, we\u0027re in real trouble here. First Mary, now two cops have been slaughtered. That wasn\u0027t the act of a vampire doing his best just to survive. It was vicious.Staged . Just as the parties have been staged. Jessica, you\u0027re the only one, human or vampire, who managed to injure him so severely that it took him hundreds of years to heal. He hates you. He\u0027ll go to any length to torment you, to destroy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica shook her head. \"No...no. I can\u0027t believe he knows I\u0027m here. That I\u0027m alive. The whole reason I created the persona of Kathleen, Countess Valor, was to make him think I\u0027d been evil, then that I was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The truth has a strange way of being discovered. Think about it. You\u0027ve been living quietly for several hundred years now. You have no idea how long he\u0027s been back. I know you took every precaution, that you barricaded the crypt with crosses. But there must have been a quake...something. He-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stopped abruptly, her eyes suddenly widening as she stared past Jessica toward the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica froze, then turned slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t knocked. And she could tell from the look in his eyes that he wasn\u0027t surprised to find her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him unflinchingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie rose. \"I didn\u0027t hear you knock,\" she said, her voice regally cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t.\" He smiled knowingly. \"I don\u0027t have to be asked in. I\u0027m not avampyr . And even if I were, you\u0027ve already asked me in.\" He stared hard at Maggie. \"Just what is the story with you, Mrs. Canady? You\u0027re not a vampire, and neither is your husband, but you\u0027re both aware of their existence. And there\u0027s something about you, about this house....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve just barged into my house unasked. Why don\u0027t you start by explainingyour self?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is there to explain? I have but one purpose. To kill vampires,\" he said very softly, and his gaze fell upon Jessica. \"There is one in particular for whom I\u0027ve been searching for years. And years,\" he added dryly. \"But then, you\u0027re both aware of that particular creature, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women stared at each other, barely daring to breathe. Maggie widened her eyes at Jessica, silently suggesting that she confess to everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica still balked at the idea, her mind racing. It couldn\u0027t be. Wouldn\u0027t she have known, somehow, even after all these years? Yet hadn\u0027t she felt the familiarity, felt the sense of...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t know about the Master until I reached Transylvania. He had been...out of commission, I suppose you\u0027d say, for hundreds of years,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan strode over to the table and stared hard at her. \"So you brought the dominatrix to life in Romania?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could hardly walk in looking like Sister Golden Hair,\" she said, then let out a sigh. \"You\u0027re so wrong about us. You have no idea how many of us fight against what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you walked in to kill the Master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun on Maggie so suddenly that she jumped. \"And you help Jessica with...with whatever it is she\u0027s doing? Your husband obviously knows and understands everything that is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understandexactly what she\u0027s going through,\" Maggie said. \"Iwas a vampire once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m...not one anymore. It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I have some time,\" Bryan said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth women just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal with Sean?\" Bryan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a cop, exactly what he looks like,\" Maggie said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, so is this just a small party going on, or are there more of your kind around here-goodvampires, as you claim?\" he demanded, turning to Jessica again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are more,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t kill any of your friends the other night?\" he queried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And I didn\u0027t start a staking campaign just to impress you, either. It\u0027s what we do. We don\u0027t kill indiscriminately-that\u0027s apparently your cause in life. We know the difference between good and evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are your buddies, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Maggie. \"Lucien and Jade are somewhere in Africa, in pursuit of a very old demon,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucien,\" he snapped. \"You\u0027re one-time king?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica held her breath. He knew more than she\u0027d realized, even that Lucien had been hailed as the king of their kind-until he had become a champion for justice, rather than a creature to be dreaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Professor, I refuse to allow this grilling to go on in my house,\" Maggie cut in. \"If we\u0027re going to answer your questions, you\u0027re going to have to answer a few of ours. We think we know what you are. A warrior. So does that make you an...angel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica offered a very unladylike snort. \"Angel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast her a sideways glance. \"No. Not an angel. A warrior as you said. I exist to fight the evil in the world.\" He stared at Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how do you survive?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord, this is the twenty-first century,\" she informed him. \"Haven\u0027t you ever heard of blood banks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where do you keep this blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re so brilliant, why didn\u0027t you search my house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I checked the refrigerator,\" he informed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently you weren\u0027t brilliant enough to find the secret drawer,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what now?\" he asked softly, pulling a chair and sitting down. Jessica sat across from him, and for a long moment they just stared. \"It\u0027s apparent that everyone was conned last night. The party was a setup. The Master never intended to show. I\u0027m a little surprised his plan wasn\u0027t to find Mary and force her into joining him in killing everyone at Montresse House, but he had something even more vile in mind. Not only were those two cops in the wrong place at the wrong time, the way he killed them sent a message as to just how evil he really is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what happened at the hospital?\" Maggie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded gravely, then returned his attention to Jessica. \"I think he\u0027s playing with you, showing you what he\u0027s capable of before he comes for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if he is baiting you?\" Jessica suggested. Then she waited, not breathing. If he wasn\u0027t the man she thought, he would deny it with a shrug. But there had been few men the Master had hated more in life than the king\u0027s right hand, the knight named Ioin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t deny the possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie, typically straightforward, said, \"I know exactly who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze riveted to her face and his brow arched. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie nodded. \"Ioin, champion of Robert the Bruce, who escaped a sure death at the hands of Edward III only because of your heroics. Robert was devastated by the loss of one of his illegitimate children-\" She broke off abruptly and managed not to look at Jessica. \"Anyway, you died so he could live. You stood alone against dozens of men while the king made his escape.\" She inhaled deeply. \"Your body was never found, though. And there was a priest who disappeared, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan stared back at Maggie, then, to Jessica\u0027s surprise, looked down as if ashamed. \"It wasn\u0027t a matter of bravery,\" he said simply. \"I don\u0027t believe I was sane at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s true?\" Maggie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You...\" Jessica said, trying not to give herself away. \"You...you didn\u0027t die? You became...what you are after the battle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not after the battle,\" he said, frowning as he studied her. \"Not exactly. I didn\u0027t awaken for hundreds of years. And when I awoke, Gregore, the priest, was still with me.\" He was quiet for a long moment. \"He lived long enough for me to learn to make my way in a new world. Long enough for me to understand the evil let loose in the world by a man who had been my most loathsome enemy in life, a man who brutalized women and children not on behalf of king or country but purely from a desire to rape, mutilate and kill. That was why I existed-to find him, however long it might take.\" He looked at Jessica and added softly, \"And to hatchet my way all others of his kind, so he could take no strength from them and evil might be utterly eradicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you have sought the Master all these years,\" Maggie murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had another goal as well,\" Bryan murmured, clenching his fingers. \"And that was to find and destroy the king\u0027s daughter. I loved her, you see. She had been a warrior herself, because villagers across our country had been victims for years, butchered and destroyed anytime an advancing army crossed their land. She defended the children, the women.... But she had been lost to the Master, tainted by his black cruelty and savagery, compounded by his pact with the Devil, if that was indeed where he gained his power. There is, you see, such a thing as an immortal soul. And I meant to find her and bring peace to what the Master had destroyed.\" He lifted his hands in a gesture of futility. \"I\u0027m almost completely convinced she took on the guise of an English countess who found residence at the French court of Louis XIV. And that others saw to her demise. Still, I have sometimes wondered. There is so much evil in the world, so many places for her to hide if she is still in existence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward. \"Now, Miss Jessica Fraser. Your turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. \"Well...I was bitten, of course,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould she lie? Or tell the truth? The truth? No, never. Not after what he had just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica said, \"Dublin, Ireland, the 1700s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as she spoke, Maggie was offering, \"Savannah, 1760.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth women broke off, staring at each other with alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Bryan said with deceptive calm. \"The truth would be quite interesting, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they never got a chance to attempt another lie, or even to offer up the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all froze as they heard the front door open and close and footsteps head toward the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the hall, Jessica realized, he could see only herself and Maggie. \"There you are! Thank God. Jessica. I didn\u0027t dare even mention this to Maggie on the phone.\" He strode over to Jessica, taking her by the shoulders, his back to Bryan, whom he clearly still hadn\u0027t seen. \"This is worse than what we feared. Jessica, he knows you\u0027re here. And he knows who you are. He wrote your name in blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica?\" Maggie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Sean replied. \"Her true name. In the blood of his victims, he wrote her true name. Igrainia.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kiss-of-darkness-alliance-vampires-7/page-16.html","bookId":2290,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM"}
