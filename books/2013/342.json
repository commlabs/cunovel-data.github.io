{"id":104450,"no":342,"title":"Page 342","content":"\u003cp\u003ePhaed raises the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind, flashes, scene after scene, the sordid list of this old woman’s constant slights, each one belittling Phaed, each one revealing to all nearby too many of Phaed’s secret terrors-no-one has the right to do that, no-one has the right to then laugh-laugh in the eyes if not out loud. All those insults, well, the time has come to pay them back. Here, with one hard thrust of the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifts the knife still higher, draws in her breath and holds it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stabs down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander’s hand snaps out, catches her wrist, hard, tightening as she twists round, lips peeled back, eyes blazing with rage and fear. Her wrist is a tiny thing, like a bony snake, caught, frenzied, seeking to turn the knife, to set the edge against Nimander’s hand. He twists again and bones break, an awful crunching, grinding sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knife clunks on the wooden floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander bears down on her, using his weight to crumple Phaed onto the floor beside the bed. She tries to scratch at his eyes and he releases the broken limb to grasp the other one. He breaks that one too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has not screamed. Amazing, that. Not a sound but her panting breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander pins her down and takes her neck in his hands. He begins to squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more, Phaed. I now do as would Anomander Rake. As would Silchas Ruin. As would Sandalath herself were she awake. I do this, because I know you-yes, even now, there, in your bulging eyes where all your awareness now gathers in a flood, I can see the truth of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emptiness inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour mother stares in horror. At what she has spawned. She stares, disbelieving, clinging desperately to the possibility that she has got it wrong, that we all have, that you are not as you are. But that is no help. Not to her. Not to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, stare up into my eyes, Phaed, and know that I see you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see you-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was being dragged away. Off Phaed. His hands were being pried loose, twisted painfully to break his grip-and he falls back, muscled arms wrapped about him now, and is dragged from Phaed, from her bloated face and the dreadful gasping-poor Phaed’s throat hurts, maybe is torn, even. To breathe is to know agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she lives. He has lost his chance, and now they will kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath screams at him-she has been screaming at him for some time, he realizes. She first screamed when he broke Phaed’s second wrist-awakened by Phaed’s own screams-oh, of course she had not stayed quiet. Snapping bones would never permit that, not even from a soulless creature as was Phaed. She had screamed, and he’d heard nothing, not even echoes-hands on the oar and squeeze!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what would happen? Now what would they do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nimander!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started, stared across at Sandalath, studied her face as if it were a stranger’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal held him, arms trapped against his sides, but Nimander was not interested in struggling. It was too late for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhaed had thrown up and the stink of her vomit was thick in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was pounding on the door-which in his wisdom Nimander had locked behind him after following Phaed into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath yelled that it was all right, everything was fine-an accident, but everything is fine now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut poor Phaed’s wrists are broken. That will need seeing to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now, Withal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands limp in my arms, wife. Can I release him now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, but be wary-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shall, no doubt of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Sandalath, positioned between Nimander and the still-coughing, gagging Phaed, took Nimander’s face in her hands and leaned closer to study his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you see, Sandalath Drukorlat? Gems bright with truths and wonders? Pits whispering at you that no bottom will ever be found, that the plunge into a soul never ends? Row, you fools! We’re sinking! Oh, don’t giggle, Nimander, don’t do that. Remain as you are, outwardly numb. Blank. What do you see? Why, nothing, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nimander.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s all right,’ he said. ‘You can kill me now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange look on her face. Something like horror. ‘Nimander, no. Listen to me. I need to know. What has happened here? Why were you in our room?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Phaed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why were you both in our room, Nimander?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, I followed her. I stayed awake-I’ve been doing that a lot. I’ve been watching her for days and days, nights and nights. Watching her sleep, waiting for her to wake up, to take out her knife and smile a greeting to the dark. The dark that is our heritage, the dark of betrayal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t remember when last I slept, Sandalath Drukorlat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to stay awake, always awake. Because of Phaed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he answer her then? Out loud, all those tumbling statements, those reasonable explanations. He wasn’t sure. ‘Kill me now, so I can sleep, I so want to sleep.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-342.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
