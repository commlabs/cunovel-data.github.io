Soon afterward, a friend told him Faith was dating someone else. It’d hurt, the way she’d handled their breakup, but that was easy to forgive now. They’d both been so young. Besides, Troy wouldn’t have married Sandy if Faith hadn’t severed their relationship. And he couldn’t imagine his life without Sandy….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got your sympathy card,” he said, explaining the reason for his call. “How did you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My son lives in Cedar Cove,” Faith said. “I was visiting him and the grandkids, and I saw the Chronicle. I always read the obituaries and…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s where you read about Sandy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is. I’m really sorry about your loss, Troy. I wasn’t sure you’d want to hear from me. That’s why I didn’t mail the card right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy didn’t know what else to say until he glanced down at the sympathy card and reread her short message. “What did you mean when you said Sandy stole me away?” His memory of their breakup was quite the opposite. Faith had dumped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laugh drifted over the phone. “Come on, Troy. You have to know you broke my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” He shook his head in bewilderment. She couldn’t have forgotten the callous way she’d treated him. “As I recall, you’re the one who broke up with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. “How can you say that?” she said. “You quit writing to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I most certainly did not,” he returned. He’d always wondered what had happened and wasn’t too proud to admit she’d hurt him badly. But none of that was important anymore. Hadn’t been in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on,” Faith said. “One of us seems to have developed a selective memory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I was thinking.” Strangely, Troy found he was enjoying this. He knew beyond a doubt that the selective memory was Faith’s—but he was willing to forgive her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said, “and it’s not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, then,” he said, “let’s review the events of that summer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea,” she concurred. “Practically as soon as we graduated from high school, you went into basic training.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” Troy was with her so far. “I remember clearly that you promised me your undying love when we said goodbye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did and I meant it.” She spoke without hesitation. “I wrote you every single day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the beginning.” He’d lived for Faith’s letters, and when she’d stopped writing he hadn’t known what to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every day,” she reiterated, “and then you stopped writing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy grew quiet. “I didn’t stop writing you, Faith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t stop writing you, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I phoned,” he said, “and your mother said you were out. Later, someone else told me you were seeing some other guy. I got the message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t date anyone other than you until after I left for college that September.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence seemed to hum between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother,” she breathed slowly. “My mother was the one who took out the mail every day and collected it, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t like me?” Troy couldn’t remember Mrs. Carroll being particularly hostile toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She liked you fine, but she thought we were too young to be serious,” Faith said. “I made the mistake of telling her I hoped you’d give me an engagement ring for Christmas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe irony was, Troy had planned on doing exactly that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean to say you believed I’d just stopped writing?” Faith asked. “Without saying a word? You honestly believed I’d do that to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes,” Troy admitted. “Just like you believed I’d given up sending you letters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then reluctantly agreed. “Did you try to get in touch with me when you finished basic training?” she asked. “You came home on leave, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I did,” Troy told her. “I went to your house—that was in late August—but by then you’d already left for college. I wanted to talk to you, but when I asked for your new address, your mother said it was probably best not to contact you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother,” Faith groaned. “I never suspected she’d do anything like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both seemed at a loss as to what to say next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she whispered, “You broke my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t come out of the relationship unscathed, either. “You broke mine,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith exhaled softly, then said, “It seems my mother has a great deal to answer for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she still alive?” Troy didn’t figure there was much point in dwelling on the sins of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. She died ten years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Despite everything, our lives worked out well, didn’t they?” he said. “Maybe not the way we expected, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Faith said. “I met Carl at Central Washington and we got married in 1970.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny little coincidences. “Sandy and I were married the same year. In June.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The twenty-third. What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The twenty-third.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was too weird. They’d each been married on the same day and in the same year—to someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Children?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two—a boy, Scott, and a girl, Jay Lynn. Scottie lives in Cedar Cove, like I said, and teaches at the high school. Jay Lynn’s married and the mother of two. She’s currently a stay-at-home mom. What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One daughter, Megan. She works at the framing shop down by the waterfront.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my goodness! Scottie just had her frame a picture I gave him of his great-grandparents. It was taken in the 1930s on the family farm in Kansas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir lives had intersected more than once. And in the last few years, she’d visited town to see her family; they could have run into each other at any time, yet never had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re the sheriff these days,” Faith said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Cedar Cove’s always been my home. I never wanted to live anywhere else. There aren’t that many of us from our graduating class around anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard about Dan Sherman’s death,” Faith told him. “Poor Grace. Scottie called me when his body was discovered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a rough one,” Troy said. He knew Dan but they’d never been close friends. “Grace is remarried—to a local rancher.” He paused. “You’d like Cliff. He’s a down-to-earth, no-nonsense kind of guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Olivia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he recalled, Faith and Olivia had been fairly good friends in high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always meant to keep in touch with Olivia, but life sort of crowded in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Olivia married a guy called Stan Lockhart when she graduated from college. They were divorced the year their son died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew she’d become a judge but I hadn’t heard that she’d lost a child. Or that her marriage broke up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It all happened more than twenty years ago now. You never attended any of the class reunions, did you?” He should know; he’d been to every one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately, yes.” Troy would’ve preferred to avoid them, but it was hard since he lived in town. And he’d been one of the senior class officers, so people expected him to plan the event. Against his will, he’d done it for most of the reunions, thanks mainly to Sandy and her organizational skills. His daughter had helped with the last reunion. He’d rather have stayed home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were going to be a nurse, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was…am,” she said, correcting herself. “Although I don’t work in the medical field now. I burned out about ten years ago.” She hesitated, as if uncertain she should continue. “I write a little but it’s no big deal. Articles about health, that sort of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? I’m impressed.” Troy had never been good at putting his thoughts on paper. Other than police reports, of course, and that was a matter of getting the facts and stating them clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. I dabble at it.” He could almost see her shrug. “I guess it’s a way to use some of my medical background.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey chatted for another few minutes and then there didn’t seem to be anything more to say. Troy searched for something to keep Faith on the line. All he knew was that he didn’t want to break the connection for fear it would be half a lifetime before they spoke again. If ever…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How often do you get to Cedar Cove these days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a lot. But Scottie’s been encouraging me to move back to town and I’m considering it.” She paused. “Why do you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking,” he said, shifting uncomfortably on his feet, “that we could get together the next time you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” she said immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could have coffee and pie at the PancakePalace.” They used to go there on dates, only it’d been a soda and fries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not Coke and French fries?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You remember that, too?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I do. We always shared both. I liked more salt than you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know when you’ll be in town?” he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could come next Saturday,” she said, “if that’s convenient.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was convenient. In fact, it couldn’t have been better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the last day of Anson Butler’s two-week leave from army training. In the morning he’d be flying to the east coast for advanced study in computer technology, working with army intelligence. Allison Cox was proud of him, proud of his success and determination. And she dreaded not being able to see him for another eight weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer parents had been wonderful to him. Together, as a family, they were sending Anson off with a big barbecue dinner. Even Eddie, her annoying younger brother, had helped decorate the patio with streamers and balloons. All their friends from school would be there, even the ones who’d believed Anson had been responsible for the fire that burned down The Lighthouse restaurant. He’d forgiven them, and if Anson could, then so could she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison had baked a cake that afternoon and was putting the finishing touches on it—smoothing out the chocolate frosting, adding candied flowers. After that, she’d go and pick up Anson at his mother’s place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You invited Mrs. Butler, didn’t you?” her mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison nodded, although she knew even before issuing the invitation that Cherry Butler would refuse. The truth was, she’d never been much of a mother. “Cherry said she’d think about it.” Allison would definitely prefer it if his mother decided not to come. Cherry’s presence would be uncomfortable and, especially if she drank, she was almost guaranteed to embarrass her son. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7/page-11.html","bookId":1948,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:25 AM"}
