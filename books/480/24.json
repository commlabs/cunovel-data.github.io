{"id":40776,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. ROUMANIAN POETRY.","content":"It is hardly necessary to remark that the history of Roumanian literature must needs be a scanty one as yet. Considering the past history of these people on either side of the frontier, and the manner in which they have been oppressed and persecuted, the wonder is rather to find them to-day so far advanced on the road that leads to immortality.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first Roumanian book (a collection of psalms, probably translated from the Greek) was printed at Kronstadt in 1577, and was succeeded by many other similar works, all printed in Cyrillian characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As historians and chroniclers, the names of Ureki, Miron Kostin, Dosithei, and of Prince Dimetrie Kantemir, all hold honorable positions between the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century. Political events then stemmed the current of progress for a time, and made of the rest of the eighteenth century a period of intellectual stagnation for all Roumanians, whether of Wallachia, Moldavia, or Transylvania. It was from the latter country that about the year 1820 was given the first impulse towards resurrection, connected with which we read the names of Lazar, Majorescu, Assaki, Mikul, Petru Major, Cipariu, Bolinteanu, Balcescu, Constantin Negruzzi, and Cogalnitscheanu.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was only after the middle of the present century that Latin characters began to be adopted in place of Cyrillian ones, and indeed it is not easy to understand why the Cyrillian alphabet ever came to be used at all. On this subject Stanley, writing in 1856, speaks as follows:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The Latinity of Rouman is, however, sadly disguised under the Cyrillic alphabet, in which it has hitherto been habited. This alphabet was adopted about 1400 A.D., after an attempt by one of the popes to unite the Roumans to the Catholic Church. The priests then burned the books in the Roman or European letters, and the Russians{159} have opposed all the attempts made latterly to cast off the Slavonic alphabet, by which the Rouman language is enchained and bound to the Slavonic dialects.... The difficulty of coming to an agreement among the men of letters, as to the system to be adopted for rendering the Cyrillic letters by Roman type, has retarded this movement as much, perhaps, as political opposition.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first Roumanian political newspaper was issued by Georg Baritiu in 1838. At present several Roumanian newspapers appear in Transylvania, of which the Observatorul and the Telegraful Roman are the principal ones. There are in the country two Greek Catholic seminaries for priests, and one Greek Oriental one, a commercial school at Kronstadt, four upper gymnasiums, and numerous primary schools, all of which are self-supporting, and receive no assistance from the Hungarian Government.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some portion of the rich store of folk songs which from time immemorial have been sung in the country by wandering minstrels, called cantari, has been rescued from oblivion by the efforts of Alexandri, and after him Torceanu, who, going about from village to village, have written down all they could learn from the lips of the peasants. One of the most beautiful and pathetic of the ballads thus collected by Alexandri is that of Curte d’Arghisch, an ancient and well-known Roumanian legend, the greater part of which I have here endeavored to reproduce in an English version. These ballads are, however, exceedingly difficult to translate at all characteristically, our language neither possessing that abundant choice of rhyme, so apt to drive a translator to envious despair, nor yet the harmonious current of sound which lends a peculiar charm to the loose and rambling metre in which these songs are mostly written.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e CLOISTER ARGHISCH.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I.\n\u003cbr\u003e By the Arghisch river,\n\u003cbr\u003e By the bonny brim,\n\u003cbr\u003e Goes the Voyvod Negru,[26]\n\u003cbr\u003e Other ten with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e {160}\n\u003cbr\u003e Nine of these his comrades,\n\u003cbr\u003e Master masons be,\n\u003cbr\u003e And the tenth is Manoll,\n\u003cbr\u003e Masters’ master he.\n\u003cbr\u003e And the ten are questing,\n\u003cbr\u003e Where along the tide\n\u003cbr\u003e They shall build the minster,\n\u003cbr\u003e And their fame beside.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then as on they stray,\n\u003cbr\u003e Meets them on the way\n\u003cbr\u003e A shepherd lad, that ditty sad\n\u003cbr\u003e Upon his pipe doth play.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Shepherd lad, dear shepherd lad,\n\u003cbr\u003e Mournful ditty playing,\n\u003cbr\u003e Up the river has thy flock\n\u003cbr\u003e And hast thou been straying?\n\u003cbr\u003e Down have strayed both thou and they,\n\u003cbr\u003e Down along the river?\n\u003cbr\u003e In thy wanderings where hast been,\n\u003cbr\u003e Say, hast thou a building seen\n\u003cbr\u003e Standing by the river,\n\u003cbr\u003e Built of moss-grown ancient stone,\n\u003cbr\u003e All unfinished and alone,\n\u003cbr\u003e Where the hazels, green and lank,\n\u003cbr\u003e Shoot amid the copsewood dank?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Ay, my master, that have I\n\u003cbr\u003e Sighted as I wandered by;\n\u003cbr\u003e Sooth, a wall doth on the strand\n\u003cbr\u003e Lonely and unfinished stand,\n\u003cbr\u003e At whose sight my hounds in haste\n\u003cbr\u003e Howling fled across the waste!”\n\u003cbr\u003e When this word the prince had heard,\n\u003cbr\u003e Joyful man was he:\n\u003cbr\u003e “Haste away!

The prince, delighted at the success of the building, asks the master masons whether they could undertake to raise a second church of yet nobler, loftier proportions than the first. This question being answered in the affirmative, the tyrannical Voyvod, probably afraid of their embellishing some other country with the work of their genius, orders the ladders and scaffolding to be removed from the building, so that the ten illustrious architects are left standing on the roof, there to perish of starvation. Hoping to escape this doom, each of the master masons constructs for himself a pair of artificial wings, or rather a sort of parachute, out of light wooden shingles, and by means of which he hopes safely to reach the ground.

Roumanian literature is in a transition state at present, and, despite much talent and energy on the part of its representatives, has not as yet regained any fixed national character. Perhaps, indeed, it would be more correct to say that precisely the talent and energy of some of the most gifted writers have harmed Roumanian literature more than they have assisted it, by dragging into fashion a dozen different modes utterly incongruous with one another, and with the mainsprings of Roumanian thought and feeling. No doubt the custom of sending their children to be educated outside the country is much to blame for this; and, naturally enough, French poets have been imported into the land along with Parisian fashions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Béranger and Musset, along with Shakespeare, Goethe, Byron, and Heine, have all been abused in this manner by men who should have understood that the strength of any literature does not lie in the successful imitation of foreign models, however excellent, but rather in the intelligent exploitation of its own historical and artistic treasures. Even Basil Alexandri, the first and most national of Roumanian poets, sometimes falls unconsciously into this error, still more perceptible in the works of Rosetti, Negruzzi, and Cornea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Odobescu, Gane, Alexi, and Dunca have acquired some fame as writers of fiction; and Joan Slavici in particular may here be cited for his charming sketches of rural life, which have something of the force and delicacy of Turguenief’s hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FET LOGOFET[29] (literally, YOUNG FOOLHARDY).\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou radiant young knight,\n\u003cbr\u003e With glance full of light,\n\u003cbr\u003e With golden-locked hair,\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, turn thy proud steed;\n\u003cbr\u003e Of the forest take heed—\n\u003cbr\u003e The dragon lies there.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou fairest of maids,\n\u003cbr\u003e With silken-like braids,\n\u003cbr\u003e So slender thy zone,\n\u003cbr\u003e {171}\n\u003cbr\u003e My good sword will pierce\n\u003cbr\u003e The monster so fierce,\n\u003cbr\u003e And fear I have none.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou wrestler, thou ranger,\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou seeker of danger,\n\u003cbr\u003e With eyes flashing fire;\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy fate will be dolesome;\n\u003cbr\u003e The dragon is loathsome,\n\u003cbr\u003e And fearful his ire.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou coaxer, thou pleader,\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou sweet interceder,\n\u003cbr\u003e My star silver bright!\n\u003cbr\u003e Both dragon and drake,\n\u003cbr\u003e Before me they quake,\n\u003cbr\u003e And fly at my sight.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou stealer of hearts,\n\u003cbr\u003e With golden-tipped darts,\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet list to my cry!\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou canst not escape,\n\u003cbr\u003e His open jaws gape,\n\u003cbr\u003e Turn water to sky!\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou angel-like child,\n\u003cbr\u003e With blue eyes so mild,\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet needst not to sigh;\n\u003cbr\u003e For this my good steed\n\u003cbr\u003e The wind can outspeed,\n\u003cbr\u003e And rear heaven-high!\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, radiant young knight,\n\u003cbr\u003e With eyes full of light,\n\u003cbr\u003e That masterful shine;\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, hark to my prayer,\n\u003cbr\u003e And do not go there—\n\u003cbr\u003e My heart it is thine!\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet needs I must ride\n\u003cbr\u003e To win as my bride\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou, maiden most sweet;\n\u003cbr\u003e I must gain renown—\n\u003cbr\u003e Either death or a crown—\n\u003cbr\u003e To lay at thy feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e THE FAULT IS NOT THINE. \n\u003cbr\u003e Full oft hast thou sworn that on this side the grave\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy love and thy heart should forever be mine;\n\u003cbr\u003e {172}\n\u003cbr\u003e But thou hast forgotten, and I—I forgave,\n\u003cbr\u003e For such is the world, and the fault is not thine.\n\u003cbr\u003e And again was thy cry, “Thou beloved of my heart,\n\u003cbr\u003e In heaven itself, without thee I’d pine!”\n\u003cbr\u003e On earth still we dwell—yet dwell we apart;\n\u003cbr\u003e ’Tis the fault of our age, and the fault is not thine.\n\u003cbr\u003e My arms they embraced thee, I drank with delight\n\u003cbr\u003e The dew from thy lips like a nectar divine;\n\u003cbr\u003e But the dew turned to venom, its freshness to blight,\n\u003cbr\u003e For such is thy sex, and the fault is not thine.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy love and thine honor, thy virtue and troth,\n\u003cbr\u003e Given now to another, were yesterday mine;\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou knowest not Love! then why should I be wroth?\n\u003cbr\u003e ’Tis the fault of thy race, and the fault is not thine.\n\u003cbr\u003e Far stronger than Love were both riches and pride,\n\u003cbr\u003e And swiftly and surely thy faith did decline;\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy wounds they are healed, thy tears they are dried,\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou couldst not remember—the fault is not thine.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet though thou art faithless, and falsely hast left me,\n\u003cbr\u003e My eyes can see naught but an angel divine;\n\u003cbr\u003e My heart flutters wildly whenever I see thee—\n\u003cbr\u003e ’Tis the fault of my love, and the fault is not mine!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I do not suppose that any one with the slightest knowledge of Roumania and Roumanians can fail to detect an alien note in both these compositions, despite the grace of the originals; nor can one help feeling that these authors should have been capable of far better things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And surely far better and grander things will come ere long from this nation, at once so old and so young! when, having regained its lost self-confidence, it comes to understand that more evil than good is engendered by a blind conformity to foreign fashions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Already a step in the right direction has been taken in the matter of national dress, which, thanks to the praiseworthy example of the Roumanian queen, has lately received much attention. And as in dress, so in literature, does Carmen Sylva take the lead, and endeavor to teach her people to value national productions above foreign importations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When, therefore, Roumanian writers begin to see that their force lies not in the servile imitation of Western models, but in working out the rich vein of their own folk-lore, and in bridging over the space which takes them back to ancient pagan traditions, then, doubtless, a new era will set in for the literature of the country. Let Roumanian poets leave Béranger and Musset to moulder on their book-shelves, and consign to oblivion Heinrich Heine, whose exquisitely morbid sentimentality is far too fragile an article to bear importation; let them cease from wandering abroad, and assuredly they will discover in their own forests and mountains better and more vigorous material than Paris or Germany can offer: the old stones around them will begin to speak, and the old gods will let themselves be lured from out their hiding-places. Then will it be seen that Apollo’s lyre has not ceased to vibrate, and the lays of ancient Rome will arise and develop to new life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2145/60661.html","bookId":480,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:54:12 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:54:12 PM"}
