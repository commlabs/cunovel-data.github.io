I trudge by her without saying a word, gingerly stepping over the remains of my crushed and mangled Vespa, which lies crumpled by the trash lining the curb, a cigarette dangling from my lips, my sunglasses on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, we were supposed to meet this morning,\" she says, clicking off the cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything, just busy myself looking for my keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They canceled the piece on you anyway,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you came to tell me in person?\" I find the keys. \"How intimidating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you care?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, take my sunglasses off. \"What did you think of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocks her head \"meaningfully,\" studies the sidewalk, squinting, then looks back up at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were well-nigh inscrutable,\" she says, mimicking a British accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thought you were a hodgepodge of banality,\" I say, mimicking a British accent too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door and step inside.
