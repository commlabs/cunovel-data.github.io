Yeah. It’s, um, a purity ring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. The old patriarchal chastity belt. Now in convenient ring form,” Adina snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not like that,” Mary Lou said, blushing. “It’s a symbol. It shows that you’ve made a pledge to bring your purity into the marriage. It’s the ultimate gift to your husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? Like you can’t just give him a gift card to GameStop or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou stopped smiling. “You don’t have to make fun of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Adina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some girls need protection,” Mary Lou mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Adina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. Jeez, I hope that thing isn’t active,” Mary Lou said, pointing to the volcano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No kidding. That’s all we need. Think we’ve got enough to make a fire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worth a shot,” Mary Lou answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the beach, the girls built a signal fire from sticks, palm leaves, and paper from their morals clause contracts, rescued from their official “Welcome, Miss Teen Dream” folders. Taylor lit it with a book of matches that had survived the crash. Night crouched around them, a hungry, patient animal. The girls lay in the sand, exhausted. Some cried themselves to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re on first watch, Miss New Hampshire. Don’t let us down,” Taylor said. She performed a few high kicks, stretched her long limbs, then settled under a tree to get her beauty sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMISS TEEN DREAM FUN FACTS PAGE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease fill in the following information and return to Jessie Jane, Miss Teen Dream Pageant administrative assistant, before Monday.

Unlike the others, she’d entered this cheesy pageant as a revolutionary act. She hated the Miss Teen Dream Pageant. Hated everything it stood for. Mostly, she hated how much her mother loved it. Ever since she was four, Adina and her mother had watched Miss Teen Dream. It had seemed to Adina then to be a TV fairy tale: All those pretty girls smiling and waving and showing off their tumbling skills. And the gowns! Such sparkles and movement!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those girls will never have trouble getting husbands. They’ll have their pick,” her mother had said dreamily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdina’s mom had had her pick, too. She’d gone from one guy to the next, in an act of downward husband mobility, until she’d married Alan the Tool. Alan, who ran self-improvement seminars for business leaders. Alan, who spoke in blowhard aphorisms like “A bird in the hand can still poop in your palm” and “If you want to beat a snake at its game, you have to think like a snake and not like a duck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was both Adina’s mom and Alan who encouraged her to enter the Miss Teen Dream Pageant to show that “just because you’re smart doesn’t mean you can’t also be pretty.” They told her if she placed in Miss New Hampshire, they’d buy her a bass for her all-girl punk band, Drink My Sweat. They figured once she got wrapped up in the pageant work, she’d forget all about the bass and the band and her journalistic aspirations. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-9.html","bookId":2717,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
