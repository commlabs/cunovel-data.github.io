He was dancing with a pretty girl wearing a pair of skintight black leather pants and a black midriff top. Her eyes were lined with kohl, she wore black lipstick. Her waist-length, silver blond hair stood out like a shining beacon in a sea of black tresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken threw back his head, laughing at something she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving toward the bar, Roshan asked the first single girl he came to if she would care to dance. Leading her onto the dance floor, he drew her into his arms. Careful to keep his back to Loken, he captured the girl\u0027s gaze with his. When she was pliant in his arms, he lowered his head, about to drink, when he overheard the voice of the blonde dancing with Loken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you looking for a vampire?\" she asked in a deliberately throaty voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fascinated by creatures of the night,\" Loken replied. \"Their lifestyle, their longevity, their ability to heal themselves of all but the most fatal of injuries. I\u0027m hoping to find a vampire who will bring me across.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027re in search of the Dark Gift?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Do you know someone who can bestow it on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might it be you?\" Loken asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027ve heard it rumored that a real vampire comes here now and then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan froze, the girl in his arms momentarily forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he come here often?\" There was no denying the excitement in Loken\u0027s voice. \"Do you think he\u0027ll be here tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s it worth to you if I can find out who it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, if you can do that, you can name your own price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan swore under his breath. Had someone seen him feeding? Or was the blonde simply telling Loken what he wanted to hear? Damn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleasing the girl in his arms from his power, Roshan led her back to the bar, then left the club, his anger rising with his hunger. Damn Loken! The man turned up at the worst times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. He had always been careful when he hunted at the Nocturne. Nevertheless, he would have to find a new place to hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith preternatural speed, he headed for the far side of town. He had little time to waste. Brenna was waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost eight o\u0027clock when he returned home. He made a quick trip down to his lair for a change of clothes, then headed for the shower. He noted, in passing, that the bedroom door was closed. He could hear Brenna humming softly inside, felt his desire quicken as he imagined her slipping into the lacy underwear she had told him about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later he knocked softly on the bedroom door. \"Brenna? Are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and she stood there, a vision in white silk, her red hair like a cloud of silken fire beneath her veil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, a half-smile playing over her lips as she waited for his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, my love,\" he murmured, \"you\u0027re beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna\u0027s gaze moved over the man who would soon be her husband. He looked resplendent in a black tuxedo, so handsome it fairly took her breath away. Even if she hadn\u0027t known he was a vampire, she would have known he wasn\u0027t mortal. No mere man could exude such power, such inner strength. It was a potent combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful not to muss her hair or her veil, Roshan drew her into his arms and kissed her lightly on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come,\" he said, smiling down at her. \"We don\u0027t want to be late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoonlight rained down on the little church in the woods, giving it an otherworldly aura. Lights shone through the stained glass windows, shedding faint rainbow-colored streaks on the ground. Roshan paused at the entrance, his preternatural senses probing the surrounding shadows and the interior of the building before he opened the door and followed Brenna inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Giovanni Lanzoni was standing at one side of the altar. The priest was of medium height. He had wavy black hair laced with silver at the temple. His eyes were hazel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slender, dark-haired man stood beside the priest. Roshan knew immediately that the dark-haired man was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman dressed in a deep purple gown and long white gloves sat in the first pew. She was not one of the undead, but supernatural power emanated from her. A witch, he thought, and wondered if his bride knew. The woman rose as Brenna drew near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear, how lovely you look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna smiled. \"Thank you. Myra, this is Roshan DeLongpre. Roshan, this is Myra Kavanaugh. She owns the bookstore I told you about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyra offered Roshan her hand. \"It\u0027s a pleasure to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I you,\" Roshan replied. Releasing her hand, he turned to the priest. \"Good evening, Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest smiled at him. \"It has been a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too long. Thank you for coming on such short notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if I would miss an occasion like this one,\" Father Lanzoni said with an easy grin. \"Roshan, this is Vincenzio Fonti. He will be your best man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan shook Fonti\u0027s hand. Power flowed between them. Roshan knew, without knowing how he knew, that Fonti was one of the ancient ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for coming,\" Roshan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am happy to do it,\" Fonti replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Lanzoni glanced from Roshan to Brenna. \"Are we expecting anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Roshan took Brenna\u0027s hand in his and gave it a squeeze. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna nodded. It suddenly seemed unreal that she was here, in this church, about to be married to a vampire by a vampire priest. She glanced at Myra, who was staring at Roshan, then at Vincenzio Fonti, who was watching Myra. Brenna clenched her free hand, wondering if Myra suspected something. Did she think it odd that the ceremony was taking place at such a late hour and that neither she or Roshan had any family present? Brenna knew little of what weddings were like in this time and place. In her own village, a marriage had been cause for celebration, with everyone from the oldest patriarch to the newest babe in attendance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Lanzoni took his place in front of the altar and Roshan and Brenna turned to face him. Myra stood at Brenna\u0027s left, Fonti at Roshan\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My children,\" Father Lanzoni began, \"we are gathered here this night to join Brenna Flanagan and Roshan DeLongpre in the bonds of holy wedlock, an institution ordained by God for the blessing of His children. There is no secret to a happy marriage,\" he said, glancing from Brenna to Roshan. \"You have only to put your loved one first and yourself second, to treat your spouse as you would be treated, to remember how much you love one another on this day and on every day that follows for as long as God grants you breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will say the words that bind you together, but the true marriage between the two of you must take place here, in your hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, do you promise to love and cherish Roshan, here present, for as long as you shall live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna looked at Roshan, her eyes glowing with love. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roshan, do you promise to love and cherish Brenna, here present, for as long as you both shall live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed deeply into her eyes. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, by the power vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith great tenderness, Roshan drew Brenna into his embrace. At that moment, he was acutely aware of how very fragile she was. As a mortal, she could easily fall prey to sickness; in a few short years, old age and death would come to steal her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will love you and no other for as long as you live.\" he murmured for her ears alone, and then he bent his head to claim his first kiss as her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat flowed between them, not the heat of passion, but the gentle warmth of heart speaking to heart as they sealed their vows with a fervent kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done,\" Father Lanzoni said with a quiet smile. \"Well done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan kissed Brenna one more time, then, taking hold of her hand as if he would never let go, he turned to face the priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure, my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFonti shook Roshan\u0027s hand. \"Congratulations,\" he said solemnly. \"I hope it works out for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFonti smiled at Brenna. \"I wish you every happiness, Mrs. DeLongpre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lovely ceremony, just lovely,\" Myra said, coming forward to give Brenna a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, and thanks again for being here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t have missed it,\" Myra assured her. She sent a speculative look at Vincenzio Fonti, and then at Roshan. \"No, indeed, I wouldn\u0027t have missed this for the world. I\u0027ve arranged for a small reception at my store,\" she said, smiling at Brenna. \"Nothing elaborate, just a small cake and some champagne. And no obligation, of course, if you\u0027ve already made other plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not sure what Roshan wants to do,\" Brenna replied, looking up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want is fine with me.\" He looked at Father Lanzoni and Fonti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am afraid I cannot stay,\" Father Lanzoni said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor I,\" Vincenzio said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" Myra said, and there was real regret in her tone. \"But you\u0027ll come, won\u0027t you?\" she said, glancing from Brenna to Roshan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Roshan said, \"if that\u0027s what Brenna wishes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe for just a little while,\" Brenna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s settled then,\" Myra said, beaming. \"I\u0027ll just go open up the shop and see you there.\" She gave Brenna\u0027s hand a squeeze and hurried out of the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something about that one,\" Fonti said. \"She is not one of us, but she has powers. Could she be a witch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A witch!\" Brenna exclaimed. \"Do you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFonti nodded. \"Her aura is similar to yours, though not so strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna frowned. Was Myra a witch? If so, why hadn\u0027t she ever mentioned it? And then, realizing what Fonti had said, she looked at him askance. \"You think my powers are stronger than hers?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-37.html","bookId":2299,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM"}
