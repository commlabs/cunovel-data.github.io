But those assets would come, oh, yes they would, shortly after the butte was wrenched from enemy hands. In the meantime, the Helljumpers would use what ground-pounders always use: their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst Lieutenant Melissa McKay had landed safely, as had most of her 130- person company. Three of her people had been killed in action on the Autumn , and two were missing and presumed dead. Not too bad, all things considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs luck would have it, McKay hit the dirt only half a klick away from the homing beacon, which meant that by the time a perimeter had been established she had already humped her gear across the hardpan, located Major Silva, and reported in. McKay was one of his favorites. The ODST officer nodded by way of a greeting. “Nice of you to drop in, Lieutenant . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to wonder if you’d taken the afternoon off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir,” McKay responded. “I dozed off on the way down and slept through my wake-up alarm. It won’t happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva managed to keep a straight face. “Glad to hear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, then pointed. “You see that butte? The one with the structures on top? I want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay looked, brought her binoculars up, and looked again. The butte’s range appeared along the bottom of the image and was soon chased out of the frame by coordinates that Wellsley inserted to replace the concepts of longitude and latitude which worked on most planetary surfaces, but not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was “setting” but there was still enough light to see by. As she surveyed the target area, a Covenant Banshee took off from the top of the butte, circled out toward the “west,” and came straight at her. The only thing that was surprising about that was the fact that it had taken the enemy so long to respond to their landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks like a tough nut to crack, sir. Especially from the ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is,” Silva agreed, “which is why we’re going to tackle it from both the air and the ground. Lord only knows how they did it, but a group of Pelican pilots were able to launch their transports before the Old Man brought the Autumn down, and they’re hidden about ten klicks north of here. We can use them to support an airborne operation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay lowered her binoculars. “And the Autumn ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s KIA back thataway,” Silva replied, hooking his thumb back over a shoulder. “I’d like to go pay my final respects, but that will have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we need is a base, something we can fortify, and use to hold the Covenant at bay. Otherwise they’re going to hunt our people down one, two, or three at a time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which is where the butte comes in,” McKay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly,” Silva answered. “So, start walking. I want your company at the foot of that butte ASAP. If there’s a path to the top I want you to find it and follow it. Once you get their attention, we’ll hit them from above.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud bang as one of the first company’s rocket jockeys fired her M19 SSM man-portable launcher, blew the incoming Banshee out of the sky, and a put a period to Silva’s sentence. The battalion cheered as the Banshee bits dribbled smoke and wobbled out of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, yes sir,” McKay answered. “When we get up there, you can buy me a beer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fair enough,” Silva agreed, “but we’ll have to brew it first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Grunts had to be granted some rest once in a while, which was why long, cylindrical tanks equipped with air locks had been shipped to Halo’s surface, where they were pumped full of methane and used in lieu of barracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving survived the nearly suicidal attack on the Autumn by rescuing a wounded Elite, and insisting that the warrior be evacuated rather than left to die, Yayap had extended the duration of his own life, not to mention those of the Grunts directly under his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, by way of celebrating that victory, the alien soldier was curled in a tiny ball, fast asleep. One leg twitched slightly as the Grunt dreamed of making his way through the swamps of his home world, past naturally occurring pillars of fire, to the marshy estuary where he had grown up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, before he could cross a row of ancient stepping-stones to the reedy hut on the far side of the family’s ancestral fish pond, Gagaw shook his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yayap! Get up quick! Remember the Elite we brought down from the ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s outside, and he wants to see you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap sprang to his feet. “Me? Did he say why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” the other Grunt replied, “but it can’t be good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much was certainly true, Yayap reflected as he waded through the chaos of equipment that hung in untidy clusters along the length of the cylinder. He entered the communal lavatory, and hurried to don his armor, breathing apparatus, and weapons harness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was more dangerous, he wondered, to show up disheveled, and have the Elite find fault with his appearance, or to show up later because he had taken the time required to ensure that his appearance would be acceptable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDealing with Elites always seemed to involve such conundrums, which was one of the many reasons that Yayap had a hearty dislike for their kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, having decided to favor speed over appearance, Yayap entered the air lock, waited for it to cycle him through, and emerged into the bright sunlight. The first thing he noticed was that the sentries, who could normally be found leaning against the tank discussing how awful the rations were, stood at rigid attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you the one called Yayap?” The deep voice came from behind him and caused the Grunt to jump. He turned, came to attention, and tried to look soldierly. “Yes, Excellency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elite named Zuka ’Zamamee wore no helmet. He couldn’t, not with the dressing that was wrapped around his head, but the rest of his armor was still in place. It was spotlessly clean, as were the weapons he wore. “Good. The medics told me that you and your file not only pulled me off the ship—but forced the assault boat to bring me down to the surface.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap felt a lump form in his throat and struggled to swallow it. The pilot had been somewhat reluctant, citing orders to wait for a full load of troops before breaking contact with the human ship, but Gagaw had been quite insistent—even going so far as to pull his plasma pistol and wave it about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Excellency,” Yayap replied, “but I can explain—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no need,” ’Zamamee replied. Yayap almost jumped; the Elite’s voice lacked the customary bark of command. It sounded almost . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap was anything but reassured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saw that a superior had been wounded,” the Elite continued, “and did what you could to ensure that he received timely medical treatment. That sort of initiative is rare, especially among the lower classes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap stared at the Elite, unable to reply. He felt disoriented. In his universe, Elites didn’t offer accolades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To show my appreciation I’ve had you transferred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap liked the normally sleepy unit to which he was attached, and had no desire to leave it. “Transferred, Excellency? To what unit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, to my unit,” the Elite replied, as if nothing could be more natural. “My assistant was killed as we boarded the human ship. You will take his place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap felt his spirits plummet. The Elites who acted as special operatives of the Prophets were fanatics, chosen for their limitless willingness to risk their lives—and the lives of those under their command. “Th-thank you, Excellency,” Yayap stuttered, “but I don’t deserve such an honor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense!” the Elite replied. “Your name has already been added to the rolls. Gather your belongings, say good-bye to your cohort, and meet me here fifteen units from now. I’m scheduled to appear in front of the Council of Masters later this evening. You will accompany me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Excellency,” Yayap said obediently. “May I inquire as to the purpose of the meeting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may,” ’Zamamee replied, allowing a hand to touch the bandage that circled his head. “The human who inflicted this wound was a warrior so capable that he represents a danger to the entire battle group. An individual who, if our records can be believed, is personally responsible for the deaths of more than a thousand of our soldiers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYayap felt his knees start to give. “By himself, Excellency?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. But never fear, those days are over. Once I receive authorization, you and I will find this human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find him?” Yayap exclaimed, protocol forgotten. “Then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then,” ’Zamamee growled, “we will kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dawn air was cold, and McKay could see her breath as she stared upward and wondered what awaited her. Half the night had been spent marching across the stretch of intervening hardpan to get into position below the butte, and the other half had been spent between trying to find a way up to the top, and grabbing a little bit of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second task had been easy, perhaps a little too easy, because other than a sloppily constructed barricade, the foot of the four-foot-wide ramp was entirely unguarded. Still, the last thing the Covenant expected was for a human ship to appear out of Slipspace, and land infantry on the surface of the construct. Viewed in that light, a certain lack of preparation was understandable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the path started at ground level, spiraled steadily upward, and hadn’t been used in some time judging from what she could see. That’s the way it appeared , anyway, although it was hard to be sure from below, and Silva was understandably reluctant to send in one of the Pelicans lest it give the plan away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, McKay and her troops would have to wind their way up along the narrow path, engage whatever defenses the Covenant might have in place, and hope that the Pelicans arrived quickly enough to take the pressure off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lieutenant eyed the readout on the transparent boom-mounted eye- screen attached to her helmet, waited for the countdown to complete itself, and started up the steep incline. Company Sergeant Tink Carter turned to face the men and women lined up behind him. “What the hell are you waiting for? An engraved invitation? Let’s get it in gear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile B Company marched toward the butte, and C Company marched off to rendezvous with the Pelicans, the rest of the battalion used the remaining hours of darkness to prepare for the following day under Major Silva’s watchful eye. Wireless sensors were placed two hundred meters out and monitored by Wellsley; three-person fire teams took up positions a hundred fifty meters out; and a rapid response team was established to support them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t any natural cover here, so the Helljumpers moved their gear up onto a low rise, and did what they could to place fortifications around it. Dirt excavated from the firing pits was used to build a low barrier around the battalion’s perimeter, connecting trenches were dug, and a landing pad was established so that Pelicans could put down within the battalion’s footprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, standing at the very highest point of the pad, and gazing off to the west, Silva listened as Wellsley spoke into his ear. “I have good news and bad news. The good news is that Lieutenant McKay has started her climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news is that the Covenant is about to attack from the west.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva lowered his glasses, turned, and looked to the west. An enormous dust cloud had appeared during the five minutes that had passed since he looked that way. “What kind of attack?” the ODST officer demanded curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s rather difficult to say,” Wellsley replied deliberately, “especially without the ships, satellites, and recon drones that I normally rely on for information. However, judging from the amount of dust, plus my knowledge of the Covenant weapons inventory, it looks like an old-fashioned cavalry charge similar to the one that Napoleon threw my way at Waterloo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t at Waterloo,” Silva reminded the AI as he brought the binoculars up to his eyes. “But, assuming you’re correct, what are they riding?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rapid attack and reconnaissance vehicles which our forces refer to as Ghosts,” Wellsley replied pedantically. “Perhaps a hundred of them . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejudging from the dust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva swore. The timing couldn’t have been worse. The Covenant had to respond to his presence, he knew that, but he had hoped for a little more time. Now, with fully half his strength committed elsewhere, he was left with roughly two hundred troops. Still, they were ODST troops, the best in the UNSC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” Silva said grimly, “if they want to charge, let’s give them the traditional counter. Order the pickets to pull back, tell Companies A and D to form an infantry square, and let’s get all the backup ammo below ground level. I want assault weapons in the pits, launchers halfway up the slope, and snipers up on the pad. No one fires until I give the command.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Silva, Wellsley knew that the Roman legions had used the infantry square to good effect, as had Lord Wellington, and many since. The formation, which consisted of a box with ranks of troops all facing outward, was extremely hard to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI relayed the instructions to the troops, who, though surprised to be deployed in such an archaic way, knew exactly what to do. By the time the Ghosts arrived and washed around the rise like an incoming tide, the square was set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva studied the rangefinder in his tac display and waited until the enemy was in range. He keyed the all-hands freq and gave the order: “Fire! Fire! ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheets of armor-piercing bullets sleeted through the air. The lead machines staggered as if they had run into a wall, Elites tumbled out of their seats, and a runaway machine skittered to the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were a lot of the attack vehicles and as the oncoming horde sprayed the Marines with plasma fire, ODST troopers began to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the weapons that fired the energy bolts were fixed, which meant that the rise would continue to offer the humans a good deal of protection, so long as the Ghosts weren’t allowed to climb the slopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso operating in the Helljumpers’ favor were the skittish nature of the machines themselves, some poor driving, and a lack of overall coordination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the Elites seemed eager to score a kill: They broke formation and raced ahead of their comrades. Silva saw one attack craft take fire from another Ghost, which crashed into a third machine, which subsequently burst into flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the Elites were quite competent, however, and after some initial confusion, they went to work devising tactics intended to break the square. A gold-armored Elite led the effort. First, rather than allowing the riders to circle the humans in whatever direction they chose, he forced them into a counterclockwise rotation. Then, having reduced collisions by at least a third, the enemy officer chose the lowest pit, the one against which the fixed plasma cannons would be most effective, and drove at it time and time again. Marines were killed, the outgoing fire slackened, and one corner of the square became vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva countered by sending a squad to reinforce the weak point, ordering his snipers to concentrate their fire on the gold Elite, and calling on the rocket jockeys to provide rotating fire. If the humans’ launchers had a weakness, it was the fact that they could only fire two rockets before being reloaded, which left at least five seconds between volleys. By alternating fire, and concentrating on the Ghosts closest to the hill, the Marine defenders were able to leverage the weapons’ effectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis strategy proved effective. Wrecked, burned, and mangled Ghosts formed a metal barricade, further protecting the humans from plasma fire, and interfering with new attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva lifted his binoculars and surveyed the smoke-laced battle area. He offered a silent thanks to whatever deity watched over the infantry. Had he led the assault, Silva would have sent in air support first to pin the Helljumpers down—followed by Ghosts from the west. His opposite number had been trained differently, had too much confidence in his mechanized troops, or was just plain inexperienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the reason, the Banshees were thrown into the mix late, apparently as an afterthought. Silva’s rocket jockeys knocked two of the aircraft out of the air on the first pass, nailed another one on the second pass, and sent the fourth running south with smoke trailing from its failing engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, with the gold Elite dead, and more than half of their number slaughtered, the remaining Elites withdrew. Some of the Ghosts remained untouched, but at least a dozen of the surviving ships carried extra riders, and most were riddled with bullet holes. Two, their engines destroyed, were towed off the field of battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why we need the butte, Silva thought as he surveyed the carnage, to avoid another victory like this one. Twenty-three Helljumpers were dead, six were critically injured, and ten had lesser wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic burped in his ear, and McKay’s voice crackled across the command freq. “Blue One to Red One, over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva swung toward the butte, raised his glasses, and saw smoke drift away from a point about halfway up the pillarlike formation. “This is Red One— go. Over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we have their attention, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Major grinned. It looked more like a grimace. “Roger that, Blue One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe put on a show for them, as well. Hang tight . . . help is on the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay ducked back beneath a rocky overhang as the latest batch of plasma grenades rained down from above. Some kept on falling, others found targets, bonded to them, and exploded seconds later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trooper screamed as one of the alien bombs landed on top of his rucksack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sergeant yelled, “Dump the pack!” but the Marine panicked, and backpedaled off the path. The grenade exploded and sprayed the cliff face with what looked like red paint. The infantry officer winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger, Red One. Sooner would be a whole helluva lot better than later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWellsley ordered the Pelicans into the air as Silva stared out over the plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if his plan would work, and if he could stomach the price. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-flood-halo-2/page-5.html","bookId":1634,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:00 PM"}
