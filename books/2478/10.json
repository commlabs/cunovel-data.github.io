{"id":83460,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eSEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost Show\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatan came shambling out into the red spotlight. There was a chorus of screams and jeers. Behind the foul-smelling mask, Billy said, \"Don\u0027t forget to tell your friends to see Dr. Mirakle\u0027s Ghost Show . . . or I\u0027ll be seeing you!\" He shook his plastic pitchfork at the dozen or so people who sat before the stage, and heard the muffled thump! as Dr. Mirakle sneaked back inside the black cabinet and closed the lid. Haze drifted in the air from the smoke bombs Mirakle had exploded. At the tent\u0027s ceiling bobbed papier-mache ghosts and skeletons as eerie tape-recorded organ music played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly was glad to get backstage and take off the mask of his Satan suit. Last night someone had pelted him with a tomato. He switched the laboring engine to reverse, which drew all the wires and dangling figures backward behind the stage curtain. Then Billy turned on the tent\u0027s lights. Dr. Mirakle was \"freed\" from the black cabinet - though the lock was a fake and had never been locked at all - and the night\u0027s last show was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly checked all the chains and wires that operated the Ghost Show figures, then went out to pick up the litter of cigarette butts and empty popcorn boxes. Dr. Mirakle went backstage, as he did every night, to place the prop figures in their little individual boxes, like small white coffins. They had one more day in a shopping-center parking lot south of Andalusia; about this time tomorrow night the carnival would be on its way to another small town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was finished, Billy went backstage and washed his hands in a bucket of soapy water, then changed into a fresh shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where are you going?\" Mirakle asked, carefully placing a ghost into a styrofoam box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly shrugged. \"I thought I\u0027d just walk up the midway, see What\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, even though you know every game on the midway is as crooked as a pig\u0027s tail. Let\u0027s see: clean hands, fresh shirt, combed hair - if I recall my ancient history, \u0027spiffing up\u0027 is what I used to do when I was about to meet a member of the opposite sex. Do you have a certain young lady in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walking up the midway, eh? You wouldn\u0027t be planning to visit a certain sideshow that\u0027s got all the roustabouts in such agitation, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly grinned. \"I thought I might look in on it.\" The Jungle Love show, down at the far end of the midway, had joined the carnival at the first of the week. There were pictures of the girls out front, and a red-painted legend read see tigra! santha the pantha! barbie balboa! leona the lioness! Not all of the girls were so attractive, but one picture had caught Billy\u0027s eye when he\u0027d strolled over there a few days before. The girl in it had short, curly blond hair, and it looked as if all she wore was a black velvet robe. Her legs were bare and shapely, and her pretty gamine face sent out a direct sexual challenge. Billy felt his stomach do slow flipflops every time he looked at that picture, but he hadn\u0027t had the time yet to go inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirakle shook his head. \"I did tell your mother I\u0027d look after you, you know, and I hear some rough customers hang around that exhibition.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that. Once a young man sees a nude woman gyrating on stage a few feet from his face, he\u0027s never quite the same again. Well, go ahead if your hormones are in such a galloping fit. I\u0027ll just finish putting the kiddies to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly left the tent, walking into the humid August night. Around him the air glowed with lights. Some of the sideshows were closing down, but most of the rides still jerked and swung their passengers through the night, their engines growling like wild beasts. The carousel, topped with white and blue bulbs, was spinning merrily as recorded calliope music rang out. The Ferris wheel was a jeweled pendant set against the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly had received a letter from home today. The letters sometimes caught up with him late, though he tried to let his Mother know in advance where the carnival would be stopping. There was a message in his father\u0027s scrawl: Hope you are fine. I went to the doctor yesterday. I feel good. Love, Dad. He\u0027d written back that he was doing fine, and business was good; he left out the fact that he had to dress up as Satan. He also didn\u0027t mention that he\u0027d seen the black aura several times in the throng of customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d found out that Dr. Mirakle\u0027s real name was Reginald Merkle, and that he had a real affinity to J.W. Dant bourbon. Several times the man had gone through his Ghost Show routine barely able to stand. Dr. Mirakle had started out to be a dentist, he\u0027d told Billy, until he realized he couldn\u0027t stomach the idea of peering into people\u0027s mouths all day long. Billy at one point had inquired about Mirakle\u0027s family, but the man quickly said he had no family except for the little figures of ghosts and skeletons. He had names for all of them, and he treated them like children. Billy was puzzled about the picture of the young man Dr. Mirakle carried in his wallet, but it was obvious Dr. Mirakle didn\u0027t want to discuss his personal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly saw the blinking red neon sign ahead: jungle love . . . jungle love. He could hear the faint booming of bass drums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother new sideshow had been added to the midway as well. It stood between the Ghost Show and the Tiltawhirl on the other side of the midway, its white clapboard structure festooned with garish paintings of snakes with venom-dripping fangs. The entrance was through the open mouth of a huge snake, and above the entrance the sign read alive! see killer snakes of the world! alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a strange thing, Billy thought, but after four days he still hadn\u0027t seen the man who ran the snake show. The only sign of life over there, besides the paying customers, was that the entrance was open at three in the afternoon and closed at eleven. Right now he saw that the door was slightly ajar. The huge red-painted snake eyes seemed to watch Billy as he hurried past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" he heard someone wail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please . . . going too fast . . . !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween Billy and the Jungle Love sideshow loomed another new ride that was shaped like the skeleton of a huge umbrella. Pour gondolas - yellow, red, purple, and one still wrapped up in a Protective green tarpaulin - whirled on the end of thick metal spokes connected to a central piston mechanism. Hydraulics hissed, and the gondolas wildly pitched up and down. Screams erupted as the ride went faster and faster, the gondolas dipping to within three feet of the ground and then quickly pitching upward to almost thirty feet. The entire mechanism groaned, swinging in a fierce circle. Two people were riding in each of the three gondolas, which had safety canopies of wire mesh that closed down over their heads. At the control lever, his foot poised above a metal brake pad, was a thin man with lank, shoulder-length brown hair. A sign with mostly burnt-out bulbs said octopus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... please stop it!\" a voice wailed from one of the gondolas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly saw the man give it more speed. The Octopus was vibrating, the noise of pounding pistons was almost shaking the ground. The man was grinning, but Billy saw that his eyes were dead. The machine seemed barely in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly stepped closer to him and touched his shoulder. \"Mister - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s head whipped around. For an instant Billy saw a red gleam in his eyes, and he started, remembering the way the beast had grinned at him out on that highway in the dead of night. Then the man blinked. \"Shitfire!\" he shouted, and stomped down on the brake as he disengaged the gears. With a high metallic shriek, the Octopus began to slow. \"Damn it, boy!\" the man said. \"Don\u0027t you sneak up on people like that!\" A jagged scar ran through the man\u0027s right eyebrow, and in a breath of wind from the Octopus his hair lifted to show he was missing an ear. One hand had only three fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Octopus was slowing. The whine of brakes had faded. But in the absence of noise Billy imagined he heard another sound: a high-pitched, eerie screaming - like a dozen voices at once. The sound faded in and out, and Billy felt his flesh crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man went to each gondola and unlocked the mesh canopies, letting out angry and tearful kids. \"So sue me!\" he shouted at one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly stared at the Octopus. He saw scaly, rust-eaten metal behind a hanging flap of tarpaulin. The faint screaming went on and on, drifting in and out. \"Why\u0027s that gondola covered up?\" he asked the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Needs work. Gonna repaint it. Don\u0027t you have nothin\u0027 better to do?\" He glared up at a couple of approaching teenagers and snapped, \"We\u0027re closed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, the eerie voices stopped, as if they\u0027d been silenced by a stronger force. Billy felt himself stepping closer to the hidden gondola. He had the sudden urge to climb into it, to close the canopy over his head, to let the Octopus whirl him high into the air. It would be the best ride in the world, he thought. The most thrilling ever. But for the most excitement, the very most, you have to ride in the covered gondola. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped in his tracks, and he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something deadly in that scabrous gondola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you lookin\u0027 at?\" the man said uneasily. When Billy turned toward him, he saw a heavy set woman with a sad face and coarse blond hair coming out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buck?\" she said tentatively. \"Buck, it\u0027s time to close down now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother me, woman!\" he shouted, and then he paused, frowning. \"I\u0027m sorry, hon,\" he said wearily, and then he looked again at the Octopus. Billy saw a strange combination of fear and love on his face. \"You\u0027re right. It\u0027s time to shut it down for tonight.\" Buck started walking to the generator that powered the ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman came toward Billy. \"Get away from that machine, boy. Get away from it right now!\" she warned him. And then the Octopus sign went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with it?\" he asked her, quietly so the man wouldn\u0027t hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, obviously afraid to say any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on about your business!\" Buck shouted at him. \"This is a good ride, boy!\" Something was about to break behind the man\u0027s eyes. \"I was in control all the time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly saw the torment in both their faces, and he hurried away. Lights were flickering off all over the midway. He saw the Jungle Love sign go out, and knew he\u0027d missed the last show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Octopus had just gone up this morning. He remembered that one of the roustabouts had split his hand open on a bolt, but then he\u0027d thought nothing of it because accidents were common. The roustabout had bled a great deal. He decided to stay away from that machine, because he remembered his mother telling him that evil could grow in the most unexpected places - like an oak tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr a machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams were silenced, Billy thought, as if the machine had offered them up to whet his curiosity. When he looked over his shoulder, the man and woman were gone. The midway was clearing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly glanced over at the Jungle Love sideshow. There was a figure standing near the entrance, where the sexy photographs were tacked to a display board. He decided to walk over, to find out if the man worked with the sideshow. But before Billy could reach him, the man stepped into the darkness between the Jungle Love trailer and the Mad Mouse maze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Billy reached the display board, he saw that the photograph of the blond girl - the one who troubled his dreams so much - had been ripped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better slow down,\" Helen Betts said. \"Wayne won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the wheel of his fire-engine-red Camaro, Terry Dozier was watching the speedometer climb to sixty-five. Before the headlights, the highway - ten miles north of Fayette - was a yellow tunnel cut through the mountain of night. Terry smiled, his eyes full of devilment. No one, not even his steady girl friend, Helen, knew that one of Terry\u0027s favorite hobbies was beating out the brains of stray cats with a Louisville Slugger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne was stretched out in the backseat, his legs sprawled on a half-empty box of Falconer Crusade Bibles, the last of a dozen boxes that Terry and Helen had helped Wayne hand-deliver. Fayette County residents who\u0027d donated upward of one hundred dollars during the highly publicized \"Bible Bounty Week\" got a Bible and a visit from Little Wayne Falconer. It had been a long, tiring day, and Wayne had healed whole families today of everything from inner-ear trouble to nicotine addiction. His restless sleep was haunted by two recurring dreams: one of a snake of fire fighting an eagle of smoke; and one in which the Creekmores were standing in that hospital waiting room, the woman\u0027s eyes fixed on him as if she could see right through his skin to the soul, her mouth opening to say Do you know what you\u0027re doing, son?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe feared he was falling under some kind of spell, because he couldn\u0027t get his mind off the woman and boy. They were using strong power on him, he thought, to draw his mind from the straight-and-narrow path. He\u0027d been reading a lot lately about demon possession, about demons that were so strong they could inhabit both the living and the dead, and nothing scared him any worse. Praying in the chapel at home seemed to ease his brain for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne came up out of a light sleep and saw Helen\u0027s autumn hair blowing in the breeze from the open window. Both she and Terry were going to college in a few weeks on Falconer Crusade scholarships. Helen was a pretty girl, he mused. Her hair smelled nice, like peppermints. He was horrified when he realized he was getting an erection, and he tried to blank out the thought of sinful sex. Nude girls sometimes cavorted in his mind, begging him to take off his clothes and join them. Stop it! he told himself, squeezing his eyes shut. But as he drifted off again he thought: I\u0027ll bet Helen and Terry do it do it do it. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" she asked Terry in a nervous whisper. \"You missed the turnoff!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On purpose, babe. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me where, Terry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve Dickerson\u0027s having a party, isn\u0027t he? We were invited, weren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . sure, but . . . that\u0027s not exactly Wayne\u0027s type of crowd. I mean . . . with everybody going off to college and all, it might be kinda wild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what? It\u0027ll do old Wayne good.\" He squeezed her thigh and she gave his hand a little love-slap. \"And if somebody gets drunk, Wayne can just touch his hand and draw out the deeeemon of al-ke-hall!\" He giggled as Helen looked at him, horrified. \"Oh come on, Betts! You don\u0027t take that healing crap seriously, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen blanched, turning quickly to make sure Wayne was still sleeping. She was sure glad it was such a clear August night, no thunderstorms around - struck by lightning would be a bad way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dickerson house was a two-story colonial on the edge of a six-acre lake. There was a long expanse of emerald green lawn, dew glittering in the squares of light cast from the windows. Terry whistled softly when he saw the tough specimens of high-horsepower cars parked along the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked the Camaro and winked at Helen. \"Wayne? We\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? We\u0027re home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . no, not just yet. We\u0027re at Steve Dickerson\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne sat up, bleary-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, before you say anything,\" Terry told him, \"there\u0027s a party goin\u0027 on. Steve\u0027s folks are out of town this weekend, so he invited everybody. I thought we could all . . . you know, unwind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But\" - Wayne stared at the house - \"Steve Dickerson isn\u0027t saved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helen and I worked hard today, didn\u0027t we? By the time we take you home and come back, it\u0027ll be pretty late. So why don\u0027t we go in for a while, just to be social?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. My . . . my father\u0027s expecting me home by . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it!\" Terry was getting out. Helen was irritated at him for dragging Wayne to this party, because she knew the hell-raisers of Indian Hills High would be here, the kind of people Terry associated with before he\u0027d been saved. Sometimes she thought that Being Saved was rubbing off Terry like old paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUneasily, Wayne followed them up the flagstone walkway. They could hear the muffled thump of loud music from inside. Helen said nervously, \"Wayne, it\u0027ll be fun. I bet there are a lot of girls who\u0027d like to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne\u0027s heart skipped a beat. \"Girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Terry rang the doorbell. \"Girls. You know what they are, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, and the riotous noise of a party in full swing came crashing out. Hal Baker stood on the threshold, his arm around a skinny blond girl who looked drunk. \"How\u0027s it hangin\u0027, Terry!\" Hal said. \"Come on in! Old Steve\u0027s around here some - \" His blurry gaze fell upon Wayne Falconer, and his face went into shock. \"Is that . . . Little Wayne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" Terry chortled, \"sure is. Thought we\u0027d stop by to check out the action!\" Terry and Helen stepped into the house, but Wayne paused. Laughter and music were thunderous inside there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond girl\u0027s nipples were showing through the purple halter-top she wore. She smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comin\u0027 in?\" Terry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ... I think I\u0027d better ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, man?\" the girl asked him, a foxy grin on her face. \"You afraid of big bad parties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m not afraid.\" And before he\u0027d realized it, Wayne had taken a step forward. Hal closed the door behind him. The Amboy Dukes singing \"Journey to the Center of the Mind\" blasted from the rear of the house. Sinful drug music, Wayne thought, as he followed Terry and Helen through a mass of people he didn\u0027t know. They were drinking and smoking and running as wild as bucks through the entire house. Wayne\u0027s spine was as stiff as pineboard. He felt as if he\u0027d stepped onto another planet. An aroma of burning rope scorched his nostrils, and a boy stumbled past him stinking drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry pressed a paper cup into Wayne\u0027s hand. \"There you go. Oh, don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s just Seven-Up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne sipped at it. It was Seven-Up, all right, but it had gone flat and tasted like the inside of an old shoe. It was as hot and smoky as Hades inside this house, and Wayne sucked on the ice in his cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mingle, Wayne,\" Terry told him, and pulled Helen away into the crowd. He didn\u0027t dare tell her that he\u0027d laced Wayne\u0027s drink with gin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne had never been to an unchaperoned party before. He wandered through the house, repelled and yet fascinated. He saw many pretty girls, some wearing tight hotpants, and one of them even smiled at him across the room. He blushed and hurried away, trying to hide the stirring in his pants. On the patio that overlooked the dark, still lake, people were dancing to the roar of a stereo. Dancing! Wayne thought. It was inviting sin! But he watched the bodies rub, transfixed. It was like watching a pagan frenzy. That burned-rope smell followed him everywhere, and he saw people smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. His eyes began to water. Across the patio he saw Terry talking to a girl with long black hair. He tried to catch Terry\u0027s attention, because he was feeling a little light-headed and needed to get home; but then Terry and Helen had started dancing to Steppenwolf music, so Wayne went off toward the lakeshore to get away from the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party, to him, was like the inside of a nervous breakdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost stumbled over a pair of bodies entwined on the ground. Catching a glimpse of exposed breasts, he apologized and continued on as a boy cursed at him. Walking far away from the house, Wayne sat down on the shore near a couple of beached canoes and sucked on his ice. He was trembling inside, and wished he\u0027d never stepped across that doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all alone?\" someone asked. A girl\u0027s voice, with a thick backhills accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked up. He couldn\u0027t see her face, but she had thick waves of black hair and he thought she was the same girl Terry had been talking to. She was wearing a low-cut peasant blouse and bell-bottoms, rolled up as if she\u0027d been wading in the water \"Want some company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swigged from a can of beer. \"This party\u0027s fucked up. I hear Dickerson put acid in the punch. That would really fuck everybody\u0027s mind, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced at the first use of that awful four-letter sex word; the second gave him a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach. She was the kind of girl who did it, he realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretend I\u0027m blind,\" the girl said, and crouched down in front of Wayne. She ran her hand all over Wayne\u0027s face. He flinched because she smelled so strongly of beer. \"See, I\u0027m blind and I\u0027ve got to feel what you look like. You go to Indian Hills?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I graduated.\" Beneath the beer odor was another aroma: the rich, musky, forbidden scent of a woman. He told himself to get up and go back to the car. But he didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Lonnie. What\u0027s yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wayne.\" He almost said Falconer, but the name hung on his lips. He shifted his position, hoping she wouldn\u0027t notice his swelling penis. Tell her who you are, he told himself, so she\u0027ll get up and leave you alone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Randy Leach? Well me and him broke up tonight. Sonofabitch is going to Samford University in Birmingham, says he\u0027s got to date other girls. Shit!\" She drank from the beer and offered it to him, but he shook his head. \"I wasted a whole summer on that bastard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s how it goes I guess.\" She looked at him and laughed. \"Hey, what\u0027s wrong? You look like a whore in church, you\u0027re so tense!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlasphemy and sacrilege! Wayne thought. He looked at her in the darkness, but could only make out the pale oval of her face, He couldn\u0027t tell if she was pretty or not, but he knew she was a lost sinner. \"Are you saved, girl?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of shocked silence. Then the girl laughed uproariously. \"Oh, wow! I thought you really meant that! You sounded just like my damn momma, always after me to go to churchy-wurchy! Are you rich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rich?\" Wayne echoed. \"I . . . guess I am,\" he said truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it. Know how I knew? \u0027Cause there\u0027s somethin\u0027 so squeaky-clean about you. And you don\u0027t even drink beer, do you, \u0027cause it\u0027s too low-class for you. Where you going to college?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up in Tennessee.\" Tell her it\u0027s the Southeastern Bible College!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could sense the girl staring at him. \"You\u0027re sweet,\" she said softly. \"Who\u0027d you come here with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terry Dozier and Helen Betts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know them.\" She sat close to him and looked out toward the lake. Wayne could feel her body heat, and again he shifted uncomfortably. The images tumbling through his mind were nasty and sinful, and he knew he was walking close to the Pit. \"I\u0027ve went with a lot of boys,\" Lonnie said after a while. \"How come every boy I ever go with just wants to have sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJezebel! Wayne thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, I know I\u0027ve got a good body and all. I was in the Miss Fayette Junior High contest last year, and I got the most points in the swimsuit competition. But seems like everybody tries to take advantage of me. Wonder why that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Wayne said in a husky voice. From a black part of his mind a sibilant voice said, She wants to do it and she uses the four-letter sex word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, before Wayne could shift away again, Lonnie leaned toward him and whispered in his ear, \"Why don\u0027t we go out in one of them canoes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve . . . I\u0027ve got my good clothes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled and tugged at his shirt. \"Then take your good clothes off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better get back to the party. Somebody\u0027ll miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss me? Naw! Randy left with somebody else! Come on, sweet thing, let\u0027s go out in a canoe. Okay? You\u0027re so tense, what\u0027s wrong? Little Lonnie make you nervous?\" She took his hand and tugged at him until he stood up, and then she pulled him with her to the nearest canoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne\u0027s head was dizzy, throbbing from the echo of the rock music from way up on the patio. Lake water lapped softly at the shore. \"I don\u0027t see any paddles in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed in carefully and rummaged around, then held up a paddle. \"Here you go. Just one, though, so you\u0027ll have to drive the boat.\" She sat down. \"What\u0027re you waitin\u0027 for, sweet thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . don\u0027t think we should go out on the lake in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said softly and invitingly, \"I trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked over his shoulder at the house, where kids were dancing on the patio. He had a strange sense of isolation, a feeling that all wasn\u0027t right and he should know what was wrong, but it evaded him. Wasn\u0027t it right, he thought, that he should be a human being too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do it, sweet thing,\" the girl whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne had to step through the water to shove the canoe off. He slipped into it, almost capsizing them and bringing a squeal of laughter from her; then they were gliding through the dark water, leaving the party noise behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" Lonnie said. \"Ain\u0027t this nice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne heard water rolling in the bottom of the canoe. His expensive loafers were getting ruined. The moon was rising, an amber scythe that looked so close and sharp you could cut your throat on it. Bullfrogs croaked from the shore, and the night closed around the drifting canoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonnie sighed deeply, a sexy, needful sigh, and Wayne thought his head might crack open like an eggshell. \"There\u0027s somethin\u0027 awful familiar about you,\" she said. \"It\u0027s your voice, I guess. Do I know you from somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music faded to a low murmur. The Dickerson house was a distant glow on the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark object lay ahead. Wayne said, \"What\u0027s that?\" and then the canoe grazed a square wooden diving platform. He took the paddle out of the water and held it over his knees. His heart was beating harder, and when Lonnie\u0027s voice came, it was like balm on a fever blister. \"We could rest here for a little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost laughed. Rest? Oh, she was a sinful Jezebel! She wanted him, he knew. She wanted to be naked for him, and to do it, \"If you want to,\" he heard himself say, as if from a stranger\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne found a rope trailing from the platform and tied up the canoe. Then he was helping Lonnie out onto the platform, and she was pressing herself against him and he could feel her breasts, her nipples jutting against his chest. His heart was pounding, his head was filled with heat and he couldn\u0027t think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m cold,\" she whispered. \"Please hold me, I\u0027m cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his arms around her, and realized it was he who was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonnie pulled him down onto the platform, as lake water chuckled around them and the smell of moss drifted up. A dam of pent-up passions cracked inside Wayne - she wants to do it and there\u0027s nobody to see, nobody to know! - and he fumbled at her clothes, his breathing harsh. His hands roamed over her body, as she held him close and whispered urgings in his ear. Her blouse came open. Wayne worked at her bra and then her breasts were free and warm against his hands. Her body pressed against his as his penis throbbed with heat. She rubbed at his crotch and then began pulling his belt loose, her teeth nipping at his neck. His pants started coming down. \"Hurry,\" she whispered. \"Hurry hurry, please ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis penis was exposed as his underwear came down, and the girl put her hand on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Wayne heard in his head the crack of his father\u0027s voice like a lash across his back: Sinner! Would you lie down with Jezebel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was excited and dizzy, his eyes squeezed shut, his mind tormented between what he wanted and what he knew he shouldn\u0027t do. She gripped his penis, and he opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no longer in the embrace of a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something that looked like a beast, a wild boar, red-eyed and grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne tried to pull away, but then the vision passed and it was Lonnie again, dark-haired Lonnie, faceless Lonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinner! Would you lie with Jezebel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Lonnie said. \"Make it big again! Make it big!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . can\u0027t . . . I . . .\" He was concentrating, trying as hard as he could. His father\u0027s voice rang in his brain, a bass rumble of Doom: Sinner! He\u0027d go to Hell for lying with a harlot, he\u0027d been tricked by Satan into coming out here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it big!\" Lonnie was saying, a note of anger and frustration in her voice. She handled his penis like a small twig. \"Come on, can\u0027t you get it up?\" After another minute or two, she released him and sat over on the platform\u0027s edge, putting her bra and blouse back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, hurriedly getting his pants on. He felt slimed by the Jezebel\u0027s touch, but wicked needs and desires still coursed through him. \"Next time,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just ... I don\u0027t feel right about this. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it. I need a man, not a little boy who can\u0027t even get it up! Come on, take me back to shore!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was ugly. The sound of it scared Wayne. \"I just . . . you won\u0027t tell anybody about this, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you? Are you queer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Please . . . you won\u0027t tell anybody, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonnie buttoned her blouse. He saw her head tilted to one side, as if in concentration. Then, slowly, she turned toward him. \"Why not? It\u0027d be somethin\u0027 for a laugh, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Satan\u0027s in you,\" he whispered. \"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He thought she smiled in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a Jezebel, a dirty sinner and oh God I shouldn\u0027t have come out here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I know where I\u0027ve heard your voice!\" the girl said and Wayne cringed. \"My momma made me listen to that Crusade crap on the radio! You\u0027re - oh, wow! You\u0027re the little healer himself, ain\u0027t you?\" She whooped with laughter. \"Yeah! You\u0027re Little Wayne Falconer! Oh, wow, everybody\u0027s gonna laugh their - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said forcefully, and she was silent. \"You\u0027re not going to tell anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says? Take me back or I\u0027ll start screamin\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to make her understand! He had to make her see he was a righteous boy! He took a step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Lonnie abruptly turned toward shore and yelled, \"HELP!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" he hissed, and pushed her. She staggered across the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HELP!\" she shouted again, her voice echoing across the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne exploded. He pushed her as hard as he could, and suddenly Lonnie\u0027s feet slipped out from under her on the moss-slick boards. She fell backward, her arms windmilling. There was a violent, sickening crunch! as the side of her head hit a corner of the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell into the lake, and the black water covered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once Wayne reached down to grasp her, but she was gone. Bubbles burst upward, smelling of lake mud. He leaned down, whining with panic, and thrust his arms underwater to find her. He got up, ran across the platform to the canoe to retrieve the paddle, and used that to probe the depths. He looked up toward the house, and started to scream for help. No! he thought. She\u0027s not hurt, she\u0027s all right! She only bumped her head a little bit, she\u0027ll come up in just a few seconds!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lonnie!\" he whispered. \"Come on up, now! Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack water sighed around the platform. He reached underwater again - and felt her hair. He gripped it and wrenched upward. It was a rotten tree limb with a green mane of algae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to ease himself into the water to look for her, but realized that if he got wet everyone would know at the party. She was probably swimming to shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lonnie?\" he called out, a little louder. Only crickets and bullfrogs answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while he began to cry, and he prayed as he\u0027d never prayed before. The dark voice in his mind whispered, She was a Jezebel a dirty sinner and she deserved what she got! He sat on the platform for a long time, shaking, his head bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne was sitting in the Camaro\u0027s backseat when Terry and Helen found him about an hour later. His face was very pale. The gin got to him, Terry thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027ve you been, Wayne?\" Terry asked as he slipped behind the wheel. \"We were lookin\u0027 for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne\u0027s smile made his face look like a skull. \"Just around. I went for a long walk. The music was too loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You meet any of those pretty girls?\" Helen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not a one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great party, huh?\" Terry started the engine. \"Listen, Wayne. Since I\u0027m on a scholarship, you . . . uh . . . won\u0027t tell your dad about this, will you? I mean, I didn\u0027t smoke or drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I won\u0027t tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Terry winked at Helen. \"It\u0027ll be our secret, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Wayne said. \"Our secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after eleven o\u0027clock, and Wayne was way late getting home. Jimmy Jed Falconer, in his robe and slippers, stood on the front porch in the cool night air and looked out toward the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d slipped out of bed without waking Cammy, because he didn\u0027t want her to be worried. His belly bulged the knot at the front of his robe, but still his stomach growled for food. Where could the boy be at this time of night? he wondered. He stood on the porch for a few minutes longer, then went back through the large, rambling house to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched on the lights, opened the refrigerator, and brought out a piece of blueberry pie Esther the cook had baked just that afternoon. Pouring himself a cold glass of milk, he sat down for a late-night snack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer was almost over. And what a glorious summer it had been, too! The Crusade had held tent revivals throughout Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana - hitting the larger towns and the cities - and next year would be ready for expansion into Texas and Arkansas. An ailing Fayette radio station had been purchased, as well as a South Carolina publishing company, and the first issue of Forward, the Crusade\u0027s magazine, would be out in October. Wayne had touched and healed a few thousand people over the course of the summer: the boy was a masterful orator, and could hold that stage like he\u0027d been born on it. When Wayne had finished the healing segment of the program, the offering plates came back filled to the brim. Wayne was a good boy, and he was as smart as a whip; but he had a stubborn streak in him, too, and he persisted in going out in the airfield where his Beechcraft Bonanza was hangared and flying without a co-pilot, getting up m the sky and doing all kinds of crazy loops and rolls. That sort of thing scared Falconer to death: what if the plane should crash? Wayne was a good pilot, but he took a lot of risks, and he seemed to enjoy the danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer gulped down the milk and chewed on a bite of pie. Yessir! It had been a glorious summer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he realized his left arm was tingling. He shook the hand, thinking it had somehow fallen asleep. It was very hot here in the kitchen, he noticed; he\u0027d begun sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you know what you\u0027re doing, son?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer stopped with another piece of pie right at his mouth. He\u0027d thought about the night in May many times, and the question the Hawthorne witch-woman had posed to Wayne. That question had surfaced in his mind as he\u0027d watched the pale and hopeful faces of the sick and infirm passing by in the Healing Line, reaching up with trembling hands toward Wayne. Suddenly, the blueberry pie tasted like ashes. He put the fork down on his plate, and touched his chest where a quick needle-jab of pain had pierced. Now it had passed. The pain was gone. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his mind was wandering in dangerous territory. What if -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what if - the witch-woman was right? And he\u0027d known it all along, that Wayne\u0027s internal battery was getting weaker and weaker, and that was why he never dared ask Wayne to heal his diseased heart. And what if Wayne knew it, too, and was continuing to play the part because . . . because it was all he\u0027d ever been taught to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Falconer thought. Wayne healed Toby, didn\u0027t he? And thousands of letters came in from people who said they were healed by Wayne\u0027s touch and presence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recalled a letter from long ago, sent to the Crusade office a week or so after the tent revival in Hawthorne. It had been from a woman named Posey, and Falconer had thrown it away as soon as he\u0027d read it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Rev. Falconer, we just want to tell you that our son Jimmie has been took by Jesus. Your boy healed him at the revival in Hawthorne, but Jesus must have a purpose for our Jimmie in Heaven. I have paid my sin for selling my baby to Mr. Tillman. May the Lord be with you, and all of your teachings. Sincerely, Laura Posey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer had made sure Wayne would never see that letter, nor the few dozen letters similar to it that the Crusade had gotten. No, it was better that the boy never, never doubt himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising unsteadily from the kitchen table, Falconer went to the den and sat down in his easy chair. The framed Falconer Crusade poster, with him looking much younger and braver and stronger, was spotlit by a ceiling light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain speared his chest. He wanted to get up now, and go upstairs to bed, but he couldn\u0027t make his body respond. Maybe he needed to take some Tums, that was all. His mind was tormented with the thought of Ramona Creekmore looking at his son and knowing it was all a lie; she had the eyes of Satan, and that boy of hers was walking Death, and it wasn\u0027t until he\u0027d met them that his heart had begun to get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you know what you\u0027re doing, son?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES HE KNOWS! Falconer raged. HE KNOWS, YOU SATAN-SPAWN BITCH! When Wayne got home, Falconer would tell the boy how they would run the Creekmores out of Hawthorne, drive them off like dogs, far away to where their wicked influence couldn\u0027t seep back into the Falconer Crusade. Pain ran up and down his body, lancing across his ribs. \"Cammy!\" he moaned. \"Cammy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePluck them out! he thought. PLUCK THEM OUT!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CAMMY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands curled around the armrests, the knuckles whitening.
