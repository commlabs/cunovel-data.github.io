{"id":92256,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eDavid felt good. So good, in fact, that he didn\u0027t know just what the hell he was doing in a hospital, but so far, they hadn\u0027t shown any sign of letting him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the cop on duty seemed to be a little bit of a wacko. He had hung something along the inner frame of the window, and though David tried not to think that New Orleans\u0027 finest might be really and totally nuts, he was pretty sure that it was garlic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guy\u0027s name was Santini. Officer Giovanni Santini. Aside from being crazy, he was a nice guy. But David wasn\u0027t at all sure why he needed an officer watching over him. It had something to do with the fact that the corpse had disappeared on his shift. He still couldn\u0027t remember much about it. He had a feeling, though, that there had been a woman. A really beautiful naked woman with great breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay, kid?\" He almost started; Santini had been so quiet over in his chair, that he had thought the man was sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I just wish I could go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon enough,\" Santini said cheerfully, fingering the big cross he wore on a chain around his neck, twin to the one David had found himself wearing when he woke up the first time after the...incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you need anything, you just let me know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to go home,\" he told Santini mournfully. \"I need to sleep all night without a nurse waking me up to take my temperature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSantini laughed. \"Sorry, kid. But if you wake up and need anything, you let me know right away. Now go to sleep,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid tried to. He even drifted off at one point, but before he fell deeply asleep, he woke again. He wasn\u0027t sure why, at first. He just sensed something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, though, it wasn\u0027t a nurse. It was a doctor, and he was one huge guy. He had David\u0027s arm in his tight grip when a light came on, aimed straight at David\u0027s face, keeping him from seeing the man, who became a silhouette against the glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn the other way, kid,\" the doctor said. \"I\u0027ve got to take some blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you taking blood in the middle of the night?\" David asked. He wanted to shield his eyes from the light, but he felt as if the sleep he couldn\u0027t quite get was somehow hanging on to him, rendering his muscles useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need it,\" the doctor said. \"Turn aside, I\u0027ll get my pints, and then you can go back to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned as bidden. Then the words hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll get my pints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePints-with anS .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned-and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor held his arm, and his teeth were sunk into his vein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, Santini was out of his chair. Without even looking up, the doctor flung back one of his arms, slamming Santini against the chest and sending him flying across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the room burst open. A second uniformed cop had appeared. The doctor still didn\u0027t ease up on David\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop or I\u0027ll shoot!\" the officer warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor turned at last. David never saw him move, but somehow he was in front of the officer and the gun was on the floor. There was a horrible keening sound. The officer was off his feet, held one-handed by the doctor, who had bitten his neck, and was sucking...smacking his lips, sucking more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSantini was up, shaking his head. He headed for the doctor\u0027s back, but once again the doctor knew he was there. He threw out an arm, and Santini dropped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awful sucking sounds continued, seeming to go on and on as David tried to scream and the world faded to a sea of red-tinged black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jessica cried, turning around in a fury, the stake in her hand. The room was dark, filled with the red mist. She couldn\u0027t see her attacker, but it hadn\u0027t been the voice of the Master that threatened her; she knew that much. As she prepared to strike, a massive blow caught her arm; her stake went flying across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt her attacker coming for her again, but she knew how to fight, and as split seconds flashed by, she waited. Then she lashed out with a hard kick, catching her opponent off balance, sending him staggering back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found her stake, wrenched open the door and went racing down the hall. She took the stairs in a single sweep, coming to the landing crouched and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had destroyed many wolves, but many yet remained, and they had not waited for any command to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly in front of her, a painfully thin woman dressed in a skintight black dress stood with her fingers twined into the hair of a young man in Gothic attire, ready to sink her fangs deep into his neck. Others were on the attack all over the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went for the vampire in the black dress first, since she was closest. A quick plunge of the stake into the back of the temptress and she was dust. Jessica heard a furious hiss and turned; an ancient vampire with gray hair and long skeletal arms was preparing to leap at her. She ducked, letting him fly overhead, then jumped atop him and sent the stake plunging downward. She saw a body go flying by-and burst into fragments of dust and bone as it passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, she turned in a rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in the low-brimmed hat and frock coat was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stared, he reached under his coat for a small crossbow as a vampire rushed at him. An arrow caught the attacker when he was just inches from the dark man\u0027s face, and he fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors were open, screams rode the sudden wind of violence whipping through the crumbling manor, and the lambs were spilling out of the plantation house in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica whirled, watching as the man in the low-brimmed hat strode through the room, arrow after arrow flying from his small crossbow. She turned again, under attack, ducking when a knife would have sliced through her neck, then rising to stake her opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly there was silence. The room had emptied. The wolves were dust. The lambs had fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only the two of them left: herself and the man with the crossbow-which was aimed at her as he felt in his jacket for an arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flew across the room, slamming into him just as his fingers closed around the arrow. He flew backwards, and she flew with him. This was the man, she realized, who had attacked her upstairs. And he was about to kill her if he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had landed hard against the wall, and she had landed on top of him, gasping for breath. She pushed against his chest, scrambling up, then turned to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late. His arm shot out, his hand catching her ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell hard to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a second he was atop her, his weight bearing her down. She wedged an arm between them, throwing him off again, and tried to scramble away. She made it to her feet, but he was up, as well, and caught her by the shoulder. Without effort, he threw her across the room, sending her crashing against the newel post. Stunned, she nearly fell, then braced herself against the newel post and kicked out with all her strength as he came near, forcing him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain she spun away in an attempt to escape, but he was there, in front of her. She tried to strike; he caught her arm. Off balance, she fell to the floor and landed next to the knife, one of the vampires had used against her earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for it as he followed her down, straddling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the knife. She could have used it, but something, some sixth sense, stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no longer on the attack, either. He simply straddled her, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared defiantly back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet Jesu,\" he whispered. \"You.\" And the sound of the words was worse than any agony she had known in years and years...and years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean had practically been crawling up the walls. He knew something was about to happen. He just didn\u0027t know where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the call came, and he moved as quickly as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the hospital room, one of the rookie cops was coming out of it, throwing up all over the place. George Mendez was there, too, having come as quickly as possible when the call went out. He followed the rookie from the room, and Sean called to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mendez,\" Sean said. \"What have you got so far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in my car when the call came. We\u0027ve got the M.E. on his way up, and a crime-scene unit. I had to walk in-\" He paused, taking a deep breath. \"I knew our men were dead, but the kid was alive. I carried him out. The only other person who\u0027s been in the room is the nurse who found the bodies. She was on duty and she heard a scream and saw the officer on duty in the hallway go in. When he didn\u0027t come back she called Security and went to check. She was standing there screaming when Security got here, and they called 911.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean looked through the doorway. The bed was empty. There was a smear of blood on the sheets. Just a smear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the rest of the room...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bloodbath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been made to look as if Santini and Clark-those were our officers, I know you can\u0027t recognize them now-went after each other. They\u0027re...a mess.\" Mendez paused. He was a toughened officer, but he was also one of the most humane and religious men with whom Sean had ever worked. There were tears in his eyes. \"Santini...he was one of my best friends. And he was a good cop. Clark, too. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make it look like they attacked each other with scalpels, but it\u0027s bull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gloves, shoe covers, sir.\" Another officer offered Sean the required crime-scene gear. He didn\u0027t even look toward the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Rohan,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I didn\u0027t have gloves or shoe covers,\" Mendez muttered. \"I...uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right. You said the kid is alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. They\u0027re giving him a transfusion now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Sean murmured. \"Maybe...maybe he\u0027ll survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" Mendez didn\u0027t sound as if he believed it for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean walked carefully into the hospital room. It was just as Mendez had described it. The two officers had died almost on top of each other, each of them with his fingers loosely wrapped around a scalpel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hunkered down and shook his head, gritting his teeth. The men\u0027s throats were both deeply cut, almost to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, Sean inspected the bodies. Santini\u0027s throat had been slashed through clean and hard, with tremendous force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Clark\u0027s neck...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClark\u0027s neck hadn\u0027t been neatly slashed. It had been cut again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attempt, Sean was certain, to hide the marks left by the killer\u0027s fangs. He started to rise. The crime-scene unit would come, but they wouldn\u0027t find any answers, only more puzzles. There would be no footprints, no fingerprints. Nothing would explain this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he hunkered back down again. By Clark\u0027s outstretched fingers, something was written in the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean stared at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing silently, with a sinking heart, he pretended to take another look at Clark\u0027s fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smeared the single word written in blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThename .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he rose, stepped out of the room. Mendez was staring at him dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendezknew .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I stay with the kid?\" Mendez asked dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean lowered his head. \"It would be good,\" he said. He looked the man straight in the eye. \"But you can\u0027t fall asleep. You can\u0027t be taken by surprise. And you have to be prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez offered him a hollow, humorless laugh. \"Oh, Sir. I have been prepared. Trust me, I\u0027m prepared. Hey, I was here with the young lady, Mary. Take a look at my hair, sir. I practically bathed in holy water.\" He took a deep breath. \"Santini really fought. You can tell. You think he\u0027s an angel now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Sean said. Hell, what else could he say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better get going, sir,\" Mendez said. \"I won\u0027t leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sean left, he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez had seen the name printed in blood, but did he know what it meant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Bryan repeated, looking down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor MacAllistair,\" she murmured back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down, and she almost cringed, but all he did was toss the black wig and cat\u0027s eye mask aside. He let out a sigh. \"Contact lenses, I presume?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged where she lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027rethe dominatrix?\" he demanded sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no real dominatrix,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached under his coat. Reaching, she was certain, for one of his deadly arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me,\" she pleaded. \"The dominatrix is all an act. I created her with rumor. I had to find a way to get into the Master\u0027s parties without appearing to be suspicious. I swear to you, the dominatrix never appeared in the flesh until Transylvania.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back, his weight on his haunches, but his thighs like iron. \"So you were at the debacle in Transylvania. Feasting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you idiot. How could you have missed what happened here tonight? I killed more of those evil creatures than you did,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hiked a brow. \"I hardly think so. And what does it matter? Vampires have a habit of turning on one another when the need arises. And youare a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, then swallowed hard. Her voice, when she spoke, was barely a whisper. \"There are good vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the agony streak across his rugged features. \"There is no such thing as a good vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there is,\" she whispered. \"There is. I swear it.\" Her mind raced. He knew she was a vampire. Was that all he knew? \"How do you think all those people escaped while you were battling the Master in Transylvania? How do you think so many survived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his eyes defiantly, as if daring him to doubt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where is the Master?\" he demanded harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no right to say that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bastard! You know nothing,\" she charged. \"And while we\u0027re here fighting each other...it was a setup,\" she said. \"He\u0027s out there somewhere, killing, and we\u0027re here. He probably intended for us to kill each other. Damn you, I came here to killhim .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that convinced him at last; she would never know. They were both distracted by a bloodcurdling scream from the yard just outside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was up in a moment, and she leapt to her feet a split second later. They both tore for the door, but he was ahead of her, racing into the red darkness. She saw him, moving as if he flew. Then she heard a hollow cry and a roar of anger, saw a figure go flying....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow stuck the figure, and it burst into dust in mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were sobs, and then the harsh demand, \"Were you bitten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no...I don\u0027t think so,\" a feminine voice said pathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever else went on there that night, Jessica decided, Bryan could handle it. It was time for her to make an exit-as speedily as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was, after all, a warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Master was out there...somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young girl, wearing too much makeup and a too-short skirt, stared at Bryan blankly. She was ashen and shaking, and looked as if she had gone entirely stupid, as if her mind had burned within her skull. She\u0027d been drinking, maybe taking drugs. Would she even remember this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come over here,\" he commanded impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you...one of them?\" she stuttered in fear. Mascara streaked her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here. For the love of God, I\u0027m out of time. I\u0027ve got to get you out of here, but I have to be certain-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear I wasn\u0027t bitten. Don\u0027t stake me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, gripped her arm and pulled her close. She didn\u0027t struggle. He saw a bruise on her neck; it was amazing she had managed to scream when she had been so nearly strangled by the vampire\u0027s grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe searched her arms, any bared flesh. She just stood there, shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could find no marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look clean. If you\u0027re lying to me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her for a minute, praying that instinct would kick in. He could usually trust his instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had failed with Jessica. He had heard a heartbeat when he held her. She had been as warm as fire. He had, in fact, never felt such a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore suddenly. \"Where are your friends? Who did you come here with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I...Cindy and Jean. They\u0027re gone. They ran...faster. My shoe caught in a tree root. I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed off, staring at him. Then she burst into tears, threw herself against him and passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" he swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get her back to people and light and safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no cop cars coming tonight. Tonight had all been a sham. The Master was somewhere else. They had all been conned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed deeply.
