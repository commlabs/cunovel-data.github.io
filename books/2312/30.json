Improve the man’s wording, that is. ‘Being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.’ He said that as well, and I defy anyone to comment more trenchantly on the experience, or to say it better.” He beamed at Keller. “I owe you more than a glass of brandy and a well-turned Johnsonian phrase. This little rascal whose life you’ve saved is my grandson, and the apple-nay, sir, the very nectarine-of my eye. And we’d have all stood around drinking and laughing while he drowned. You observed, and you acted, and God bless you for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did you say to that? Keller wondered.It was nothing? Well, shucks? There had to be an apt phrase, and maybe Samuel Johnson could have found it, but he couldn’t. So he said nothing, and just tried not to look po-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t even know your name,” the white-haired man went on. “That’s not remarkable in and of itself. I don’t know half the people here, and I’m content to remain in my ignorance. But I ought to know your name, wouldn’t you agree?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller might have picked a name out of the air, but the one that leaped to mind was Boswell, and he couldn’t say that to a man who quoted Samuel Johnson. So he supplied the name he’d traveled under, the one he’d signed when he checked into the hotel, the one on the driver’s license and credit cards in his wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Michael Soderholm,” he said, “and I can’t even tell you the name of the fellow who brought me here. We met over drinks in the hotel bar and he said he was going to a party and it would be perfectly all right if I came along. I felt a little funny about it, but-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” the man said. “You can’t possibly propose to apologize for your presence here. It’s kept my grandson from a watery if chlorinated grave. And I’ve just told you I don’t know half my guests, but that doesn’t make them any the less welcome.” He took a deep drink of his brandy and topped up both glasses. “Michael Soderholm,” he said. “Swedish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A mixture of everything,” Keller said, improvising. “My great-grandfather Soderholm came over from Sweden, but my other ancestors came from all over Europe, plus I’m something like a sixteenth American Indian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Which tribe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cherokee,” Keller said, thinking of the jazz tune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m an eighth Comanche,” the man said. “So I’m afraid we’re not tribal bloodbrothers. The rest’s British Isles, a mix of Scots and Irish and English. Old Texas stock. But you’re not Texan yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it can’t be helped, as the saying goes. Unless you decide to move here, and who’s to say that you won’t? It’s a fine place for a man to live.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy thinks everybody should love Texas the way he does,” the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everybody should,” her father said. “The only thing wrong with Texans is we’re a long-winded lot. Look at the time it’s taking me to introduce myself! Mr. Soderholm, Mr. Michael Soderholm, my name’s Garrity, Wallace Penrose Garrity, and I’m your grateful host this evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo kidding, thought Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party, lifesaving and all, took place on Saturday night. The next day Keller sat in his hotel room and watched the Cowboys beat the Vikings with a field goal in the last three minutes of double overtime. The game had seesawed back and forth, with interceptions and runbacks, and the announcers kept telling each other what a great game it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller supposed they were right. It had all the ingredients, and it wasn’t the players’ fault that he himself was entirely unmoved by their performance. He could watch sports, and often did, but he almost never got caught up in it. He had occasionally wondered if his work might have something to do with it. On one level, when your job involved dealing regularly with life and death, how could you care if some overpaid steroid abuser had a touchdown run called back? And, on another level, you saw unorthodox solutions to a team’s problems on the field. When Emmitt Smith kept crashing through the Minnesota line, Keller found himself wondering why they didn’t deputize someone to shoot the son of a bitch in the back of the neck, right below his star-covered helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it was better than watching golf, say, which in turn had to be better than playing golf. And he couldn’t get out and work, because there was nothing for him to do. Last night’s reconnaissance mission had been both better and worse than he could have hoped, and what was he supposed to do now, park his rented Ford across the street from the Garrity mansion and clock the comings and goings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo need for that. He could bide his time, just so he got there in time for Sunday dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some more potatoes, Mr. Soderholm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re delicious,” Keller said. “But I’m full. Really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we can’t keep calling you Mr. Soderholm,” Garrity said. “I’ve only held off this long for not knowing whether you prefer Mike or Michael.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mike’s fine,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then Mike it is. And I’m Wally, Mike, or W.P., though there are those who call me ‘The Walrus.’ ” Timmy laughed, and clapped both hands over his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Though never to his face,” said the woman who’d offered Keller more potatoes. She was Ellen Garrity, Timmy’s aunt and Garrity’s daughter-in-law, and Keller was now instructed to call her Ellie. Her husband, a big-shouldered fellow who seemed to be smiling bravely through the heartbreak of male-pattern baldness, was Garrity’s son Hank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller remembered Timothy’s mother from the night before, but hadn’t got her name at the time, or her relationship to Garrity. She was Rhonda Sue Butler, as it turned out, and everybody called her Rhonda Sue, except for her husband, who called her Ronnie. His name was Doak Butler, and he looked like a college jock who’d been too light for pro ball, although he now seemed to be closing the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank and Ellie, Doak and Rhonda Sue. And, at the far end of the table, Vanessa, who was married to Wally but who was clearly not the mother of Hank or Rhonda Sue, or anyone else. Keller supposed you could describe her as Wally’s trophy wife, a sign of his success. She was young, no older than Wally’s kids, and she looked to be well bred and elegant, and she even had the good grace to hide the boredom Keller was sure she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the lot of them. Wally and Vanessa, Hank and Ellen, Doak and Rhonda Sue. And Timothy, who he was assured had been swimming that very afternoon, the aquatic equivalent of getting right back on the horse. He’d had no cramps this time, but he’d had an attentive eye kept on him throughout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven of them, then. And Keller… also known as Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re here on business,” Wally said. “And stuck here over the weekend, which is the worst part of a business trip, as far as I’m concerned. More trouble than it’s worth to fly back to Chicago?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them were in Wally’s den, a fine room paneled in knotty pecan and trimmed out in red leather, with western doodads on the walls-here a branding iron, there a longhorn skull. Keller had accepted a brandy and declined a cigar, and the aroma of Wally’s Havana was giving him second thoughts. Keller didn’t smoke, but from the smell of it the cigar wasn’t a mere matter of smoking. It was more along the lines of a religious experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seemed that way,” Keller said. He’d supplied Chicago as Michael Soderholm’s home base, though Soderholm’s license placed him in Southern California. “By the time I fly there and back… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve spent your weekend on airplanes. Well, it’s our good fortune you decided to stay. Now what I’d like to do is find a way to make it your good fortune as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve already done that,” Keller told him. “I crashed a great party last night and actually got to feel like a hero for a few minutes. And tonight I sit down to a fine dinner with nice people and get to top it off with a glass of outstanding brandy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heartburn told him how outstanding it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I had in mind,” Wally said smoothly, “was to get you to work for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhom did he want him to kill? Keller almost blurted out the question until he remembered that Garrity didn’t know what he did for a living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t say who you work for,” Garrity went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the job’s hush-hush for now. Well, I can respect that, and from the hints you’ve dropped I gather you’re here scouting out something in the way of mergers and acquisitions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m sure it’s well paid, and you must like the work or I don’t think you’d stay with it. So what do I have to do to get you to switch horses and come work for me? I’ll tell you one thing- Chicago ’s a real nice place, but nobody who ever moved from there to Big D went around with a sour face about it. I don’t know you well yet, but I can tell you’re our kind of people and Dallas ’ll be your kind of town. And I don’t know what they’re paying you, but I suspect I can top it, and offer you a stake in a growing company with all sorts of attractive possibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller listened, nodded judiciously, sipped a little brandy. It was amazing, he thought, the way things came along when you weren’t looking for them. It was straight out of Horatio Alger, for God’s sake-Ragged Dick stops the runaway horse and saves the daughter of the captain of industry, and the next thing you know he’s president of IBM with rising expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I’ll have that cigar after all,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, come on, Keller,” Dot said. “You know the rules. I can’t tell you that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s sort of important,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the things the client buys,” she said, “is confidentiality. That’s what he wants and it’s what we provide. Even if the agent in place-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The agent in place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s you,” she said. “You’re the agent, and Dallas is the place. Even if you get caught red-handed, the confidentiality of the client remains uncompromised. And do you know why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the agent in place knows how to keep mum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mum’s the word,” she agreed, “and there’s no question you’re the strong silent type, but even if your lip loosens you can’t sink a ship if you don’t know when it’s sailing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller thought that over. “You lost me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it came out a little abstruse, didn’t it? Point is you can’t tell what you don’t know, Keller, which is why the agent doesn’t get to know the client’s name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dot,” he said, trying to sound injured. “Dot, how long have you known me?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-30.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
