The floor tiles, chairs, tables, candles, and everything else that could be taken away was soon gone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, it was nothing more than an empty shell, and Bai Xiaochun’s heart was pounding as he thought of the gains he had made.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he didn’t forget the delicious food and fine wine. After scanning the entire area with divine sense, he found that whatever race of people had once existed here had plenty of hidden reserves. Licking his lips, he took it all, and then scanned the surrounding ruins one last time to make sure he hadn’t missed anything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFeeling very pleased, he returned to the fan to find Bai Xiaochi waiting for him, an envious look on his face. Without any further ado, they turned the fan and headed off into the distance. By this point, the brothel’s spell formation wasn’t working anymore, and therefore, they easily escaped the area.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs the fan flew through the void, and as Bai Xiaochun sat there cross-legged, continuing to work on the formula for thirty-colored flame, court was being held back in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty in the Eternal Immortal Domains!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDuring times when Bai Xiaochun wasn’t present, matters of national concern were handled by Zhou Zimo, Song Junwan, Hou Xiaomei, the Grand Heavenmaster, the Giant Ghost King, Li Qinghou, and Gongsun Wan’er.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDabao had long since grown up, and acted his part as Bai Xiaochun’s heir. He wasn’t impulsive and belligerent like he had been when he was young, although his fundamental personality hadn’t changed. As far as his cultivation base went, he had made shocking progress, and was already in the Demigod Realm!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of fleshly body, even the Giant Ghost King had to admit that his grandson was probably the toughest person he had ever met, other than Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eXiaoxiao’s cultivation base was a bit higher than Dabao’s. However, she had spent most her time in recent years in secluded meditation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith more and more celestials, the Arch-Emperor Dynasty’s foundation grew stronger and stronger. However, because it was public knowledge that Bai Xiaochun was in seclusion, rumors began to spread.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe talk wasn’t heard in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, but rather, in the Saint-Emperor Dynasty and Vile-Emperor Dynasty. According to the rumors, Bai Xiaochun actually didn’t have archaean-level battle prowess. Instead, he had paid a huge price to come out on top in the conflicts of the past, and as a result, had been forced to spend the time afterward in meditation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was true that he had occasionally come back to spend time with Xiaoxiao, Dabao, and the rest of his family. However, most of his time was spent on his research, and his travels in the void. Sometimes, he would only come back once in an entire year, and wouldn\u0027t stay for very long when he did.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The gossip is most abundant in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty,” the Grand Heavenmaster said. “There is definitely someone intentionally spreading the rumors. If His Majesty doesn’t make a public appearance soon, I fear it will lead to troublesome developments.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Most important of all is His Majesty’s cultivation base….” At the moment, everyone was trying to come up with a plan for what to do next. Bai Xiaochun hadn’t visited for several years now, and no one knew about the fact that he was now an archaean. And because he was so determined to succeed with thirty-colored flame as soon as possible, he hadn’t taken the time to check in on the situation back home.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven as everyone in the grand hall frowned and tried to think of good suggestions about what to do, a massive, rumbling boom filled the sky above!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like heavenly thunder, and it didn’t just affect the Arch-Emperor Dynasty. The Saint-Emperor Dynasty and Vile-Emperor Dynasty also experienced the same thing…. All of the Eternal Immortal Domains were filled with the deafening sound!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMassive waves rolled across the Eternal Sea as the entire world shook. At the same time, everyone felt an incredible pressure descending from the heavens!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! What… what is that sound!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCountless people all over the world were thrown into alarm. At the same time, the most powerful experts in the three imperial dynasties flew out into the open and looked up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat was the origin of the sound!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo everyone’s shock, the enormous sovereign who had existed for countless years without ever moving… had suddenly moved! His eyes had twitched!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of the powerful experts could sense it, and it immediately caused all of their minds to reel!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The giant moved!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not seeing things, am I? He… he actually twitched!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How could this be? The legends… are actually true!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor flew out at almost the same time, and hovered above their respective imperial cities. A somber look could be seen in the Saint-Emperor’s eyes, whereas a mysterious glow was visible in the Vile-Emperor’s.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven as all of the countless cultivators looked on, hearts pounding with sensations of deadly crisis, the twitching of the enormous sovereign’s eyes caused more than a hundred boulders to dislodge from his forehead, and shoot down toward the Eternal Immortal Domains like meteors!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey moved with incredible speed, and even seemed to be self-aware. No matter how quickly the Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor reacted, they couldn’t block them all!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMassive booms echoed out from the ground below from the impacts of those that made it through!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithout the slightest hesitation, the Saint-Emperor issued orders to his people.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“All celestials and all demigods will immediately search the Saint-Emperor Dynasty for those fallen rocks. If any of them seem to be alive, destroy them!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSimilar orders were passed down in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, except that instead of ordering any living things to be destroyed, they were to be collected.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSoon, both of the dynasties were fully mobilized. Even the sea areas were not overlooked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was not present, but the Grand Heavenmaster and other leaders of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty made the same decision as the others, sending celestials and demigods out to search!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Bai Xiaochun was back on his treasured fan, expression somber as he focused on a bit of fire taking shape in front of him. The transformations occurring within this fire were different than in twenty-nine-colored flame. It was impossible to see the colors within the flame, as though all of the colors had combined together, making the fire transparent!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun had already completed the main outline of the formula, and with every test he did, he inched closer to completion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven still, after all of the failures, Bai Xiaochun was starting to come to the conclusion… that success was not a foregone conclusion. He was perfectly prepared, and completely qualified in terms of experience. And yet, every time he tried, there was still a high chance of failure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Does concocting thirty-colored flame all come down to luck…?” he murmured. He had already failed dozens of times, something that would drive most people to despair. After all, every failure involved a huge wastage of souls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven with the massive stockpile he had built up, it was still a shocking loss. Based on his calculations, he only had enough for about twenty more tries, after which he would be out of souls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDuring his years traveling in the void, he hadn’t collected all of the souls there were to be had, but had definitely acquired a good portion. Whatever scattered souls that still remained in random locations would be very troublesome to track down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I have to make this work!” Sighing, he continued to work hard. A few days later, intense rumblings sounds erupted out, and an unsightly expression appeared on Bai Xiaochun’s face. After sitting there in a bit of a daze for a while, he started working again….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, the days marched by. A month later, he had eight more failures under his belt, each one seemingly due to a different reason. He still couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was. Another month passed, and he was starting to form the kernel of an idea about what was going on. His next session of conjuring went very smoothly….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis heart pounded, and he stopped breathing as he focused completely on his task at hand. His mind emptied of everything, as he concentrated completely on… the sea of fire!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAn unknown amount of time passed. Eventually, he began to regain his faculties, whereupon he found himself looking at… a dazzling tongue of flame, floating right there in front of him!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty colors….” Shivering with excitement, he thought back to all of the hard work that had gone into this moment, and what it would be like to resurrect Bai Hao. And then, he started laughing at the top of his lungs!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1250\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1252\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1251","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
