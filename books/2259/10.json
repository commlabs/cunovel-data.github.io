The pets actually had enormous power over their wolves, and the wolves were well aware of it. Even the humans who were bloodmates were naturally submissive. The bloodmatch wouldn’t have chosen them otherwise. It was the way the bloodmatch worked, and there had rarely been a mistake. Of course there had been a few aberrations along the way. He’d heard rumors, especially from the other packs, and he wondered briefly if his own mate might not be one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “aberration” in question looked up at him, his eyelashes fluttering with the sensations he was feeling. God, he was so beautiful. Gavin groaned, pushing his finger in deeper, adding another one and working them in and out. Pressing up he searched for the little bundle of nerves and found the spot, watching the sweet face in front of him come apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you want me to stop, sweetheart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Tucker seemed confused at the question. “No…don’t stop…more…harder…I-I need more…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin groaned and slid his cock carefully into him, trying to go slow and easy. He might still be a little sore after the weekend before. He checked Tucker’s erection. He was still hard as hell and leaking pre-cum. Gavin slowly increased his thrusts. He didn’t know if he could resist claiming Tucker much longer—he had to make this fast, or he would give him the mating bite, which would mean they’d be in bed all day. Sliding his hand down the length of Tucker’s cock, he put his thumb over the slit and dipped inside gently, causing him to arch his back, cry out and come hard, at the same time Gavin thrust deeply inside him again and again. Tucker spurted all over Gavin’s chest and his own stomach, the hot cum gluing their bodies together. Gavin moved deep and hard inside him, unable to hold back as he pumped Tucker’s cock through his orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker reached up and grabbed Gavin’s shoulders, holding on with a tight grip as Gavin rode him, going in as far as the gland would let him, his balls slapping against Tucker’s sweet ass. With a cry Gavin came, arching up over Tucker and then collapsing on top of him, kissing his face and his neck, licking and nipping at him in his passion. For at least five minutes, he lay on top of Tucker, catching his breath and trying to calm down. He’d never climaxed so hard in his life. It had been mind-blowing, excruciating, fucking wonderful. If every time with his pet was like this, he wouldn’t survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out finally and rolled to the side of the bed before walking into the bathroom to clean up. He wrapped a towel around his waist, wet a warm cloth and brought it back to the bed to clean up his lover tenderly. Tucker watched his every move with those amazing eyes. Gavin fell back down beside him, and kissed him once more before leaning on his elbow and gazing down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Much as I’d like to keep you in my bed all day, we’ve got a little problem, you and me. I need to tell you some things, and I have a feeling you’re not going to like them too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker looked up at him. He was almost afraid of what Gavin had to tell him. He decided he’d ask his own questions first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gavin, you have to tell me what the hell happened last night. Was I hallucinating? Did you put something in my drink? Tell me, please! Ihave to know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin sat up too, shifting his gaze to the window. “You weren’t hallucinating, Tucker. The killer was after you last night—the same one who killed the others. This time he came after you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker put one knuckle under his chin and turned Gavin’s face back toward him. He knew Gavin was telling him the truth, and it was scaring him some. Why did the murderer come after him? Was it just because he was a cop like two of the other victims? Why were they here in Gavin’s hotel room instead of at the police station? Something was terribly wrong about all of this. “Gavin, please,” he said softly. “What exactly happened to the murderer? I-I have some crazy images in my head, but I had to be tripping on drugs or something. Someone slipped me something, or…Gavin, why didn’t we stay on the beach to wait for the police?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…uh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful, Gavin. Don’t lie to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin flushed and looked up at him. “I’m not going to lie, and you weren’t drugged. What you saw was real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Tucker’s raised eyebrow, Gavin made a sound of impatience and started to get up. Tucker put a hand on his chest. “Gavin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell you any more after all, Tucker. This was a bad idea. I probably need to take you up to the mountains with me. This can’t be said down here—it sounds too farfetched, but it’s all true, and I need you to believe me. Maybe if I can get you back home, you can see.” He pushed against Tucker’s hand, and Tucker was a little surprised at how strong he was. In a sudden move, Tucker swung a leg over him and straddled his body, looking down at him. Gavin looked up in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what? And what do you mean a bad idea? Am I a bad idea, Gavin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, baby, not you; of course not. It’s just…look, I can’t talk about any of this. You’re very stubborn, Tucker, but I can be stubborn too.” He put his hands on Tucker’s waist and picked him up as if he were a child, placing him carefully on the bed beside him and getting to his feet, almost in one rapid move. He pulled on the sweats and a T-shirt and turned to face Tucker. How could he be so strong? Tucker wasn’t big, but hell, he wasn’t that little. A sudden memory of being carried off the beach in Gavin’s arms the night before came back to him. He didn’t remember Gavin even being out of breath. Gavin smiled down at the lookon Tucker’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not guilty of anything, Tucker. And yes, I know you have a lot to sort out right now, but I think this is a bad idea. We have to go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, go home? You’re not going anywhere until I figure this out.” Tucker scrambled up to stand facing him, clenching his fists at his side. Gavin looked down at him with a strange expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to fight me, Tucker? I won’t fight you. I can’t hurt you.” He put a hand out to cup Tucker’s face tenderly, but Tucker shrugged him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll have to, if you think you’re getting me out of here without giving me some answers. I mean it, Gavin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did occur to Tucker just how ridiculous this might seem if there had been an onlooker. Two naked men squaring off to each other in hotel room—well, one was naked and squaring off, the other was dressed and just gazing back serenely. Damn it, how could Gavin be so casual about this, and how did Tucker always seem to be naked while Gavin was dressed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a tense moment neither of them moved, and then Gavin sighed and sat back down on the side of the bed. “All right, pet. Ask your questions. I won’t fight you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker stood fidgeting for a moment, wanting to lighten the mood and make up for the argument, somehow. He rubbed his hand over his face and heaved a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, I saw some coffee on the counter. Can I fix you some? We can drink it,and we’ll talk—that’s all. I’m sorry I sounded like such a jerk. I don’t want to fight either.” Tucker held a hand out to him. “Please, Gavin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a little sigh, Gavin accepted his hand and allowed himself to be pulled into the sitting area. There was a small coffee maker in the room and Tucker bustled around for a few minutes with water and coffee packets, darting glances at Gavin from time to time to make sure he was still sitting calmly, giving himself time to get it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-uh…I didn’t mean to get so pushy with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin nodded, but didn’t say anything. While the coffee was brewing, Tucker leaned against the dresser, searching for a neutral topic, but coming up empty. He noticed Gavin’s eyes on him and realized he was still completely naked. He gave Gavin a slow grin. “Guess I need to put some clothes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not on my account. I like looking at you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker felt the heat of a slow blush sliding up his body. A little flustered, he shrugged and busied himself with putting out the plastic cups, sugar and creamer. When he got close to the sofa, Gavin reached for him and pulled him over into the circle of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker gazed down at him in surprise. Used to playing the more dominant role in the bedroom, this turnaround wasn’t something he was comfortable with. Gavin pulled him close and kissed his stomach below his navel. His fingers trailed along the little concave spot just above his thigh. “You don’t like compliments, do you, pet? Idon’t mean to embarrass you, but it’s true. You have an amazing body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker snorted, feeling a slow hot flush coming up his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s true.” Gavin’s fingers moved around the back and gripped his ass. “And this little ass—so round and tight. Really gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, enough about my ass!” Gavin dropped his hands, and sat back, but not before Tucker saw a flash of hurt in his eyes. Shit! Tucker made himself stand still and not bend over to hug him, even though he was itching to. “Uh…about that pet thing you’re calling me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes? Does it bother you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker shrugged. “It sounds like something in S\u0026amp;M. I’m not a sub. Not your pet. Look, sometimes two kind of dominant guys get together, I get that, and one of them has to be the bottom, I suppose, but that’s not really my deal—you know, long term and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin narrowed his eyes, regarding him seriously. “You don’t have to be anything one way or the other to let me take care of you and make you feel good. But okay. If you say so.” He shrugged and dropped his arms, turning back to his coffee. “This smells good,” he said, taking a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot letting him change the subject seemed important right then. Gavin ignored the comment about the coffee. “Well, I do say so,and I don’t need anyone to take care of me,” Tucker said, not letting it go. When Gavin continued to drink his coffee, Tucker shrugged, beginning to feel foolish standing there naked, serving Gavin coffee while all the time protesting he wasn’t a sub. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-on-the-rise-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-7/page-10.html","bookId":2259,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:18:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:18:12 PM"}
