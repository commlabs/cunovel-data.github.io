{"id":50029,"no":332,"title":"Book 12, Chapter 15 - Dire Circumstances","content":"\u003cp\u003eAlthough Ji Ning and Yu Wei were wary, they weren’t afraid. As they saw it, the only one of the six who they needed to be careful of was Adept Danzhu. Ning had broken through to the twelfth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], and he was completely confident in being able to defeat Adept Danzhu. What he didn’t realize was that although Adept Danzhu was formidable, in this six-person squad, Adept Blackstone and Adept Ninedeaths were even more frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh! The bald, barefoot, black-skinned youth suddenly smirked, and instantly, streaks of light shot out everywhere like bolts of lightning. They were ancient, plain-looking Fuxi Staffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuxi Staffs! A formation!” Ning was startled. There were very few supreme geniuses who also trained in formations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreaks of light intersected and runes formed and flowed. The formation appeared, locking down the nearby region of space for ten kilometers, completely capturing Ning and Yu Wei within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done.” The black-skinned youth said calmly, “I’ve already sealed this area off. There’s no place these two can run to. Whether you decide to kill them or release them is up to you.” He actually sat down in the lotus position towards the edges of the sealing barrier, planting his gnarled staff next to him. He just sat there, clearly not wanting to intervene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already had enough talismans; for him to set up this grand sealing formation against the enemies was enough of a show of kindness for his teammates. Have him do battle as well? He couldn’t be bothered to… and in his bones, he wasn’t the type of person who enjoyed battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ji Ning.” Xiamang Qi said coldly, “Obediently hand over all of your talismans, and the two of you can live. Otherwise… death is your only escape!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hand over your talismans!” Kindwater Qi barked as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hand them over,” the silver-haired maiden, Adept Snowfly, barked at them as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese three didn’t have enough talismans yet. Naturally, they felt the most urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdept Danzhu smiled. “Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, to tell you the truth, there are people in this squad who are more powerful than me. I urge you to cease any attempts at struggling and hand over the talismans. That way, you will stay alive. You’ve only trained for a very short period of time; your potential is limitless. There’s no need for you to push yourself too far in this Conclave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing stood there in the distance. “Come and take them, if you can.” He replied coldly, “You want me to just give them up to you? Keep dreaming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside Ning’s voice, an enormous Waterflame Lotus suddenly appeared and bloomed. The layers of fiery lotus petals and watery lotus petals were incomparably beautiful as they continuously swiveled. Ning and Yu Wei were in the center, protected by the enormous Waterflame Lotus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t waste words with them,” the silver-haired maiden said coldly. “Attack.” As she spoke, a horsetail whisk suddenly appeared in her hand. She flicked it outwards, and thousands of white strands flew towards the air, then formed into a bizarre beast’s head. This snowy white beast’s head appeared incomparably savage. Its mouth was filled with rows on rows of jagged teeth that gnashed against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowy white beast head opened its mouth, then bit downwards towards Ning and Yu Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Waterflame Lotus, however, continued to protect the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. The snowy white head bit down against the Waterflame Lotus, and its countless teeth ground against each other, easily biting through a layer of leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Ning was secretly startled. Still, as he had expected, no one who was able to survive to this stage would be easy to handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill.” Kindwater Qi’s hands formed together into a hand-seal. Instantly, layers of black light flew out from his body, forming giant serpents that appeared in midair. A total of six giant black serpents appeared, wildly assaulting Ning and Yu Wei and also breaking through a layer of leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too stubborn.” Adept Danzhu let out a soft sigh, but then her eyes suddenly lit up. An invisible divine will attack instantly swept towards Ning and Yu Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei’s face turned white. As for Ning, he felt as though his soul was being stabbed at by a needle-like divine will. However, his soul and his divine body had now completely fused together, and it was far more durable against this sort of attack. He was able to completely withstand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ninedeaths, kill them!” Xiamang Qi howled as he transformed into a fifty-four-meter-tall giant. His entire body glowed with a golden light, and he radiated an aura that filled the heavens. He was wielding a giant warblade in his hands, and he trampled past the already-shattered lotus leaves as he charged towards Ning and Yu Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ji Ning? Seems pretty powerful.” The dirty-looking maiden chortled. With a flicker, she transformed to a size of sixty meters, but her body didn’t give off a hint of any aura at all. She seemed quite ordinary, just enormous, and she charged forward with completely empty hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five of them had instantly attacked in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“F*ck off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing suddenly exploded with power, becoming a fifty-four-meter-tall giant with an aura that similarly filled the heavens. Letting out an enraged roar, his divine will formed into countless invisible swords, warblades, and longspears that immediately struck towards Adept Danzhu, Adept Snowfly, Adept Ninedeaths, Kindwater Qi, and Xiamang Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a Ki cultivator broke through to the Primal Daoist level, it was his soul that benefited the most. Similarly, once a Fiendgod Body Refiner broke through to the Primal level, his soul would be tremendously benefited as well. Ning had reached the twelfth stage, and his soul had been nourished by his divine body, resulting in it explosively increasing in strength. In fact, it was already almost comparable to his Primaltwin’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this clash, the faces of all five immediately changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“BREAK!” Ning, his aura filling the heavens, wielded two enormous Immortal swords in his hands as he charged forward, sending the swords howling forth as his sword-light chopped directly against that enormous snowy white beast’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowy white beast’s head was immediately chopped apart and collapsed, transforming back into countless white strands that flew back to the silver-haired maiden with the flywhisk. She had a look of shock on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go!” After breaking through the snowy white hound with one sword chop, Ning sent his dominating sword-light forward once more, charging straight against the six giant black snakes, knocking all of them flying backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill!” With the next step, Ning arrived in front of Xiamang Qi, and his sword-light chopped directly towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Block!” Xiamang Qi was frightened by Ning’s ferocious, savage aura. He didn’t dare to be overconfident, and he focused on defense. CLANG! With a loud sound, Xiamang Qi’s enormous, fifty-four-meter-tall giant body was knocked backwards like a meteor, slamming directly against the walls of the distant sealing barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s this powerful?!” Xiamang Qi, Kindwater Qi, and Adept Snowfly were both awestruck. Against the three of them, Ning had absolutely suppressed and crushed them; if they were fighting one-on-one, he probably would’ve taken their lives in just two or three exchanges of blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh. Right at this moment, the dirty-looking youth charged straight forward towards Ning. She struck out with her palm, and it hacked downwards like a knife towards Ning. This palm-blow… it was simply perfectly exquisite. Ning could sense the unfathomable profoundness of it, a profoundness which absolutely surpassed his own sword technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing raised his own sword as well to meet the palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBANG!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword-light and the palm collided against each other; the dirty-looking maiden was knocked backwards and forced to take three steps back, while Ning only took a single step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?!” Ning was shocked. During the final few months in the world of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, he had always immediately used the [Starseizing Hand] when he attacked; he didn’t dare to hold anything back at this point. After all, none of the survivors were easy to deal with. For example, against Xiamang Qi, even though he had immediately used the [Starseizing Hand], he still hadn’t been able to kill him with a single blow. Clearly, all of the survivors were extremely powerful! But this maiden actually dared to block his sharp sword with her hands, and did so successfully?! This was insane!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rest of you, go handle that woman. Leave this Ji Ning to me.” The dirty-looking maiden was clearly quite excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing’s body blurred momentarily, and he instantly transformed into a three heads and six arms form. With six swords in his hands, he charged straight towards the dirty-looking maiden. “If you don’t want to die, then hurry up and leave!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so rare for me to encounter a good opponent.” Instead of leaving, the dirty-looking maiden went to welcome his attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill, kill, kill!” Ning showed no mercy at all. After using [Three Heads, Six Arms], his sword-light rained down like a curtain of lightning. This dirty-looking maiden, however, relied on her pair of palms. They danced in front of her and were actually able to block the majority of the sword-light. Although the remaining sword-light blows were able to pierce onto her body… they were only able to leave some minor wounds on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can her body be as tough as magic treasures?! My full-force blows can cause even Earth-ranked magic treasures to be torn asunder… but are only able to leave small wounds on her skin?” Ning was completely awestruck. “I can’t waste time with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a flash, Ning moved to charge towards Adept Snowfly and Kindwater Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are mine!” The dirty-looking maiden’s body flashed as well. She, too, transformed with the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique. She moved alongside Ning as though she were flying water, and her six palms continuously smashed and hacked towards Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?!” Ning was frantic. The maiden in front of him was completely insistent on continuing to fight against him. Although Ning’s swordplay was ferocious, against a person whose entire body was comparable to an unbreakable magic treasure, there was nothing he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdept Snowfly, Kindwater Qi, Xiamang Qi, and Adept Danzhu, seeing the situation, all began to focus against Yu Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Black and white.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taiji.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei stood there, the black phoenix and the white phoenix twirling around her. She was like an unbreakable steel wall, simultaneously dealing with the attacks of all four. The giant snowy white beast head, the six giant black serpents, and an enormous semi-translucent grand seal in the skies created by Adept Danzhu through a secret art… they came smashing down towards her two phoenixes repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Junior apprentice-brother,” Yu Wei sent a frantic mental call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior apprentice-sister.” Ning understood that she wasn’t going to be able to hold much longer. Although her power had increased tremendously, and although she was an expert at defense… she still wasn’t going to be able to defend against four at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three-headed, six-armed Ji Ning roared furiously, “Get the f*ck away!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t strong enough to make me.” The dirty-looking maiden, also with three heads and six arms, had completely tied him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing hadn’t even felt this stifled when fighting against Xiamang Zishan. Not only did this maiden have a body like a magic treasure, she also had an extremely, extremely high level of comprehension regarding the Dao. Each of her techniques were unfathomably miraculous, and she was able to completely tie him down, giving him no chance to run away from her at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Junior apprentice-brother,” Yu Wei’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind, and as it did, Ning saw what was happening from afar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white phoenix finally collapsed, and the fifty-four-meter-tall Xiamang Qi charged towardsYu Wei, warblade at the ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go.” Ning frantically summoned the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Instantly, more than seven hundred swords appeared, floating in midair and condensing their power to form a streak of sword-light that shot out towards Xiamang Qi. Although Ning’s close combat power had increased tremendously, the power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] hadn’t improve that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClang! Xiamang Qi was able to block the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] with one saber blow. Although his body trembled from the collision, he continued to charged towards Yu Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single black phoenix was left, and it was struggling to defend against the grand seal, the giant black snake, and the snowy white beast head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiamang Qi was charging into close combat… Yu Wei hurriedly moved to retreat, but given that they were trapped within this grand sealing formation and being attacked from all sides, where could she retreat to?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClang! After Xiamang Qi’s warblade blocked the attack from the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], his right arm suddenly began to emanate hundreds of bizarre colors and even a strange black ki that caused one’s heart to tremble as he grabbed towards Yu Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The [Myriad Hibernating Venoms]!” Yu Wei’s face immediately changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she struggled to block, how could she compare in close combat to a Fiendgod Refiner like Xiamang Qi? Instantly, his right arm, still emanating that terrifying black aura, pierced directly through her flank, and the terrifying venoms instantly invaded her entire body, causing her face to instantly turn a deathly dark gray color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-12-chapter-14\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-12-chapter-16\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-12-chapter-15","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:12 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:12 AM"}
