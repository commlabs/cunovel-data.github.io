But, without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I\u0027d imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then,\" he said, his voice seething with disapproval. \"Up you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped me onto his back, and took off running. Even after all this time, it felt routine. Easy. Evidently this was something you never forgot, like riding a bicycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even��dark enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn\u0027t burn my eyes the way the wind in the big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. Like the thick quilt I\u0027d played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to have to close my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred times better than the motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my face toward him and pressed my lips into the cold stone skin of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he said, as the vague, black shapes of trees raced past us. \"Does that mean you\u0027ve decided you\u0027re awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. The sound was easy, natural, effortless. It sounded right. \"Not really. More that, either way, I\u0027m not trying to wake up. Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll earn your trust back somehow,\" he murmured, mostly to himself. \"If it\u0027s my final act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust you,\" I assured him. \"It\u0027s me I don\u0027t trust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain that, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d slowed to a walk��I could only tell because the wind ceased��and I guessed that we weren\u0027t far from the house. In fact, I thought I could make out the sound of the river rushing somewhere close by in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well��\" I struggled to find the right way to phrase it. \"I don\u0027t trust myself to be�� enough. To deserve you. There\u0027s nothing about me that could hold you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and reached around to pull me from his back. His gentle hands did not release me; after he\u0027d set me on my feet again, he wrapped his arms tightly around me, hugging me to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your hold is permanent and unbreakable,\" he whispered. \"Never doubt that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how could I not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never did tell me��\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What your greatest problem is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you one guess.\" I sighed, and reached up to touch the tip of his nose with my index finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027m worse than the Volturi,\" he said grimly. \"I guess I\u0027ve earned that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"The worst the Volturi can do is kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited with tense eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can leave me,\" I explained. \"The Volturi, Victoria�� they\u0027re nothing compared to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the darkness, I could see the anguish twist his face��it reminded me of his expression under Jane\u0027s torturing gaze; I felt sick, and regretted speaking the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" I whispered, touching his face. \"Don\u0027t be sad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled one corner of his mouth up halfheartedly, but the expression didn\u0027t touch his eyes. \"If there was only some way to make you see that I can\u0027t leave you,\" he whispered. \"Time, I suppose, will be the way to convince you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked the idea of time. \"Okay,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was still tormented. I tried to distract him with inconsequentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So��since you\u0027re staying. Can I have my stuff back?\" I asked, making my tone as light as I could manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy attempt worked, to an extent: he laughed. But his eyes retained the misery. \"Your things were never gone,\" he told me. \"I knew it was wrong, since I promised you peace without reminders. It was stupid and childish, but I wanted to leave something of myself with you. The CD, the pictures, the tickets��they\u0027re all under your floorboards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, seeming slightly cheered by my obvious pleasure in this trivial fact. It wasn\u0027t enough to heal the pain in his face completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" I said slowly, \"I\u0027m not sure, but I wonder�� I think maybe I knew it the whole time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only wanted to take away the agony in his eyes, but as I spoke the words, they sounded truer than I expected they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some part of me, my subconscious maybe, never stopped believing that you still cared whether I lived or died. That\u0027s probably why I was hearing the voices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a very deep silence for a moment. \"Voices?\" he asked flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, just one voice. Yours. It\u0027s a long story.\" The wary look on his face made me wish that I hadn\u0027t brought that up. Would he think I was crazy, like everyone else? Was everyone else right about that? But at least that expression��the one that made him look like something was burning him��faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got time.\" His voice was unnaturally even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pretty pathetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure how to explain. \"Do you remember what Alice said about extreme sports?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke the words without inflection or emphasis. \"You jumped off a cliff for fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, right. And before that, with the motorcycle��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motorcycle?\" he asked. I knew his voice well enough to hear something brewing behind the calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I didn\u0027t tell Alice about that part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, about that�� See, I found that�� when I was doing something dangerous or stupid�� I could remember you more clearly,\" I confessed, feeling completely mental. \"I could remember how your voice sounded when you were angry. I could hear it, like you were standing right there next to me. Mostly I tried not to think about you, but this didn\u0027t hurt so much��it was like you were protecting me again. Like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou didn\u0027t want me to be hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, well, I wonder if the reason I could hear you so clearly was because, underneath it all. I always knew that you hadn\u0027t stopped loving me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, as I spoke, the words brought with them a sense of conviction. Of rightness. Some deep place inside me recognized truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words came out half-strangled. \"You�� were�� risking your life�� to hear��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" I interrupted him. \"Hold on a second. I think I\u0027m having an epiphany here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of that night in Port Angeles when I\u0027d had my first delusion. I\u0027d come up with two options. Insanity or wish fulfillment. I\u0027d seen no third option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if you sincerely believed something was true, but you were dead wrong? What if you were so stubbornly sure that you were right, that you wouldn\u0027t even consider the truth? Would the truth be silenced, or would it try to break through?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOption three: Edward loved me. The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that what I\u0027d been trying to tell myself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Okay. I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your epiphany?\" he asked, his voice uneven and strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love me,\" I marveled. The sense of conviction and Tightness washed through me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough his eyes were still anxious, the crooked smile I loved best flashed across his face. \"Truly, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart inflated like it was going to crack right through my ribs. It filled my chest and blocked my throat so that I could not speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really did want me the way I wanted him��forever. It was only fear for my soul, for the human things he didn\u0027t want to take from me, that made him so desperate to leave me mortal. Compared to the fear that he didn\u0027t want me, this hurdle��my soul��seemed almost insignificant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my face tightly between his cool hands and kissed me until I was so dizzy the forest was spinning. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, and I was not the only one breathing harder than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were better at it than I was, you know,\" he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better at what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surviving. You, at least, made an effort. You got up in the morning, tried to be normal for Charlie, followed the pattern of your life. When I wasn\u0027t actively tracking, I was�� totally useless. I couldn\u0027t be around my family��I couldn\u0027t be around anyone. I\u0027m embarrassed to admit that I more or less curled up into a ball and let the misery have me.\" He grinned, sheepish. \"It was much more pathetic than hearing voices. And, of course, you know I do that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was deeply relieved that he really seemed to understand��comforted that this all made sense to him. At any rate, he wasn\u0027t looking at me like I was crazy. He was looking at me like�� he loved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only heard one voice,\" I corrected him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and then pulled me tight against his right side and started to lead me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just humoring you with this.\" He motioned broadly with his hand toward the darkness in front of us as we walked. There was something pale and immense there��the house, I realized. \"It doesn\u0027t matter in the slightest what they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This affects them now, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led me through the open front door into the dark house and flipped the lights on. The room was just as I\u0027d remembered it��the piano and the white couches and the pale, massive staircase. No dust, no white sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward called out the names with no more volume than I\u0027d use in regular conversation. \"Carlisle? Esme? Rosalie? Emmett? Jasper? Alice?\" They would hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle was suddenly standing beside me, as if he\u0027d been there all along. \"Welcome back, Bella.\" He smiled. \"What can we do for you this morning? I imagine, due to the hour, that this is not a purely social visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I\u0027d like to talk to everyone at once, if that\u0027s okay. About something important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help glancing up at Edward\u0027s face as I spoke. His expression was critical, but resigned. When I looked back to Carlisle, he was looking at Edward, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Carlisle said. \"Why don\u0027t we talk in the other room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle led the way through the bright living room, around the corner to the dining room, turning on lights as he went. The walls were white, the ceilings high, like the living room. In the center of the room, under the low-hanging chandelier, was a large, polished oval table surrounded by eight chairs. Carlisle held out a chair for me at the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never seen the Cullens use the dining room table before��it was just a prop. They didn\u0027t eat in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I turned to sit in the chair, I saw that we were not alone. Esme had followed Edward, and behind her the rest of the family filed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle sat down on my right, and Edward on my left. Everyone else took their seats in silence. Alice was grinning at me, already in on the plot. Emmett and Jasper looked curious, and Rosalie smiled at me tentatively. My answering smile was just as timid. That was going to take some getting used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle nodded toward me. \"The floor is yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. Their gazing eyes made me nervous. Edward took my hand under the table. I peeked at him, but he was watching the others, his fate suddenly fierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I paused. \"I\u0027m hoping Alice has already told you everything that happened in Volterra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything,\" Alice assured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw her a meaningful look. \"And on the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, too,\" she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I sighed with relief. \"Then we\u0027re all on the same page.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited patiently while I tried to order my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I have a problem,\" I began. \"Alice promised the Volturi that I would become one of you. They\u0027re going to send someone to check, and I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a bad thing��something to avoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so, now, this involves you all. I\u0027m sorry about that.\" I looked at each one of their beautiful faces, saving the most beautiful for last. Edward\u0027s mouth was turned down into a grimace. \"But, if you don\u0027t want me, then I\u0027m not going to force myself on you, whether Alice is willing or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme opened her mouth to speak, but I held up one finger to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, let me finish. You all know what I want. And I\u0027m sure you know what Edward thinks, too. I think the only fair way to decide is for everyone to have a vote. If you decide you don\u0027t want me, then�� I guess I\u0027ll go back to Italy alone. I can\u0027t have them coming here.\" My forehead creased as I considered that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the faint rumble of a growl in Edward\u0027s chest. I ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking into account, then, that I won\u0027t put any of you in danger either way, I want you to vote yes or no on the issue of me becoming a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half-smiled on the last word, and gestured toward Carlisle to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" Edward interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him through narrowed eyes. He raised his eyebrows at me, squeezing my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something to add before we vote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the danger Bella\u0027s referring to,\" he continued. \"I don\u0027t think we need to be overly anxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression became more animated. He put his free hand on the shining table and leaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see,\" he explained, looking around the table while he spoke, \"there was more than one reason why I didn\u0027t want to shake Aro\u0027s hand there at the end. There\u0027s something they didn\u0027t think of, and I didn\u0027t want to cine them in.\" He grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which was?\" Alice prodded. I was sure my expression was just as skeptical as hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Volturi are overconfident, and with good reason. When they decide to find someone, it\u0027s not really a problem. Do you remember Demetri?\" He glanced down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. He took that as a yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He finds people��that\u0027s his talent, why they keep him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, the whole time we were with any of them, I was picking their brains for anything that might save us, getting as much information as possible. So I saw how Demetri\u0027s talent works. He\u0027s a tracker��a tracker a thousand times more gifted than Jarres was. His ability is loosely related to what I do, or what Aro does. He catches the�� flavor? I don\u0027t know how to describe it�� the tenor�� of someone\u0027s mind, and then he follows that. It works over immense distances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But after Aro\u0027s little experiments, well��\" Edward shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he won\u0027t be able to find me,\" I said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smug. \"I\u0027m sure of it. He relies totally on that other sense. When it doesn\u0027t work with you, they\u0027ll all be blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how does that solve anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite obviously, Alice will be able to tell when they\u0027re planning a visit, and I\u0027ll hide you. They\u0027ll be helpless,\" he said with fierce enjoyment. \"It will be like looking for a piece of straw in a haystack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Emmett exchanged a glance and a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis made no sense. \"But they can find you,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I can take care of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent plan, my brother,\" he said with enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stretched out his arm to smack Emmett\u0027s fist with his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Rosalie hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice.\" Jasper\u0027s voice was appreciative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Idiots,\" Alice muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme just glared at Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened up in my chair, focusing. This was my meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. Edward has offered an alternative for you to consider,\" I said coolly. \"Let\u0027s vote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked toward Edward this time; it would be better to get his opinion out of the way. \"Do you want me to join your family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were hard and black as flint. \"Not that way. You\u0027re staying human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded once, keeping my face businesslike, and then moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jasper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, voice grave. I was a little surprised��I hadn\u0027t been at all sure of his vote��but I suppressed my reaction and moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, biting down on her full, perfect bottom lip. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my face blank and turned my head slightly to move on, but she held up both her hands, palms forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me explain,\" she pleaded. \"I don\u0027t mean that I have any aversion to you as a sister. It\u0027s just that�� this is not the life I would have chosen for myself. I wish there had been someone there to vote no for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded slowly, and then turned to Emmett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, yes!\" He grinned. \"We can find some other way to pick a fight with this Demetri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still grimacing at that when I looked at Esme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course, Bella. I already think of you as part of my family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Esme,\" I murmured as I turned toward Carlisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was suddenly nervous, wishing I had asked for his vote first. I was sure that this was the vote that mattered most, the vote that counted more than any majority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle wasn\u0027t looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Edward growled. His jaw was strained tight, his lips curled back from his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way that makes sense,\" Carlisle insisted. \"You\u0027ve chosen not to live without her, and that doesn\u0027t leave me a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward dropped my hand, shoving away from the table. He stalked out of the room, snarling under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you know my vote.\" Carlisle sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still staring after Edward. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn earsplitting crash echoed from the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched, and spoke quickly. \"That\u0027s all I needed. Thank you. For wanting to keep me. I feel exactly the same way about all of you, too.\" My voice was jagged with emotion by the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme was at my side in a flash, her cold arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dearest Bella,\" she breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged her back. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Rosalie looking down at the table, and I realized that my words could be construed in two ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Alice,\" I said when Esme released me. \"Where do you want to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice stared at me, her eyes widening with terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No! NO!\" Edward roared, charging back into the room. He was in my face before I had time to blink, bending over me, his expression twisted in rage. \"Are you insane?\" he shouted. \"Have you utterly lost your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed away, my hands over my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Bella,\" Alice interjected in an anxious voice. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ready for that. I\u0027ll need to prepare��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised,\" I reminded her, glaring under Edward\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but�� Seriously, Bella! I don\u0027t have any idea how to not killyou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it,\" I encouraged. \"I trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward snarled in fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice shook her head quickly, looking panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle?\" I turned to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward grabbed my face in his hand, forcing me to look at him. His other hand was out, palm toward Carlisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle ignored that. \"I\u0027m able to do it,\" he answered my question. I wished I could see his expression. \"You would be in no danger of me losing control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good.\" I hoped he could understand; it was hard to talk clearly the way Edward held my jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Edward said between his teeth. \"It doesn\u0027t have to be now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no reason for it not to be now,\" I said, the words coming out distorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can think of a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can,\" I said sourly. \"Now let go of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe freed my face, and folded his arms across his chest. \"In about two hours, Charlie will be here looking for you. I wouldn\u0027t put it past him to involve the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All three of them.\" But I frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was always the hardest part. Charlie, Renee. Now Jacob, too. The people I would lose, the people I would hurt. I wished there was some way that I could be the only one to suffer, but I knew that was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, I was hurting them more by staying human. Putting Charlie in constant danger through my proximity. Putting Jake in worse danger still by drawing his enemies across the land he felt bound to protect. And Renee��I couldn\u0027t even risk a visit to see my own mother for fear of bringing my deadly problems along with me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a danger magnet; I\u0027d accepted that about myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccepting this, I knew I needed to be able to take care of myself and protect the ones I loved, even if that meant that I couldn\u0027t be with them. I needed to be strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the interest of remaining inconspicuous,\" Edward said, still talking through his gritted teeth, but looking at Carlisle now, \"I suggest that we put this conversation off, at the very least until Bella finishes high school, and moves out of Charlie\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a reasonable request, Bella,\" Carlisle pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Charlie\u0027s reaction when he woke up this morning, if��after all that life had put him through in the last week with Harry\u0027s loss, and then I had put him through with my unexplained disappearance��he were to find my bed empty. Charlie deserved better than that. It was just a little more time; graduation wasn\u0027t so far away��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips. \"I\u0027ll consider it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward relaxed. His jaw unclenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should probably take you home,\" he said, more calm now, but clearly in a hurry to get me out of here. \"Just in case Charlie wakes up early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Carlisle. \"After graduation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, smiled, and turned back to Edward. \"Okay. You can take me home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward rushed me out of the house before Carlisle could promise me anything else. He took me out the back, so I didn\u0027t get to see what was broken in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a quiet trip home. I was feeling triumphant, and a little smug. Scared stiff, too, of course, but I tried not to think about that part. It did me no good to worry about the pain��the physical or the emotional��so I wouldn\u0027t. Not until I absolutely had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to my house, Edward didn\u0027t pause. He dashed up the wall and through my window in half a second. Then he pulled my arms frcm around his neck and set me on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking, but his expression surprised me. Instead of furious, it was calculating. He paced silently back and forth across my dark room while I watched with growing suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you\u0027re planning, it\u0027s not going to work,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh. I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh,\" I groaned, throwing myself back on the bed and pulling the quilt over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound, but suddenly he was there. He flipped the cover back so he could see me. He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elying next to me. His hand reached up to brush my hair from my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027d much rather you didn\u0027t hide your face. I\u0027ve lived without it for as long as I can stand. Now�� tell me something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked, unwilling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you could have anything in the world, anything at all, what would it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the skepticism in my eyes. \"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head impatiently. \"Something you don\u0027t already have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure where he was trying to lead me, so I thought carefully before I answered. I came up with something that was both true, and also probably impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would want�� Carlisle not to have to do it. I would want you to change me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched his reaction warily, expecting more of the fury I\u0027d seen at his house. I was surprised that his expression didn\u0027t change. It was still calculating, thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you be willing to trade for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe my ears. I gawked at his composed face and blurted out the answer before I could think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled faintly, and then pursed his lips. \"Five years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face twisted into an expression somewhere between chagrin and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said anything,\" he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but�� you\u0027ll use the time to find a way out of it. I have to strike while the iron is hot. Besides, it\u0027s just too dangerous to be human��for me, at least. So, anything but that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Three years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it worth anyrhing to you at all? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about how much I wanted this. Better to keep a poker face, I decided, and not let him know how very much that was. It would give me more leverage. \"Six months?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes. \"Not good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One year, then,\" I said. \"That\u0027s my limit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least give me two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way. Nineteen I\u0027ll do. But I\u0027m not going anywhere near twenty. If you\u0027re staying in your teens forever, then so am I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for a minute. \"All right. Forget time limits. If you want me to be the one��then you\u0027ll just have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto meet one condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Condition?\" My voice went flat. \"What condition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were cautious��he spoke slowly. \"Marry me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, waiting�� \"Okay. What\u0027s the punch line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"You\u0027re wounding my ego, Bella. I just proposed to you, and you think it\u0027s a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, please be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am one hundred percent serious.\" He gazed at me with no hint of humor in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, c\u0027mon,\" I said, an edge of hysteria in my voice. \"I\u0027m only eighteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m nearly a hundred and ten. It\u0027s time I settled down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away, out the dark window, trying to control the panic before it gave me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, marriage isn\u0027t exactly that high on my list of priorities, you know? It was sort of the kiss of death for Renee and Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting choice of words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled deeply. \"Please don\u0027t tell me that you\u0027re afraid of the commitment,\" his voice was disbelieving, and I understood what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not it exactly,\" I hedged. \"I\u0027m�� afraid of Renee. She has some really intense opinions on getting married before you\u0027re thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she\u0027d rather you became one of the eternal damned than get married.\" He laughed darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you\u0027re joking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, if you compare the level of commitment between a marital union as opposed to bartering your soul in exchange for an eternity as a vampire��\" He shook his head. \"If you\u0027re not brave enough to marry me, then��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I interrupted. \"What if I did? What if I told you to take me to Vegas now? Would I be a vampire in three days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, his teeth flashing in the dark. \"Sure,\" he said, calling my bluff. \"I\u0027ll get my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit.\" I muttered. \"I\u0027ll give you eighteen months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No deal,\" he said, grinning. \"I like this condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll have Carlisle do it when I graduate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s what you really want.\" He shrugged, and his smile became absolutely angelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re impossible,\" I groaned. \"A monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"Is that why you won\u0027t marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned toward me; his night-dark eyes melted and smoldered and shattered my concentration. \" Please, Bella?\" he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot how to breathe for a moment. When I recovered, I shook my head quickly, trying to clear my suddenly clouded mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would this have gone better if I d had time to get a ring.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No rings!\" I very nearly snouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027ve done it,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie\u0027s getting up; I\u0027d better leave,\" Edward said with resignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stopped beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gauged my expression for a second. \"Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whispered eagerly. \"Stay. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward smiled and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seethed in the darkness as I waited for Charlie to check on me. Edward knew exactly what he was doing, and I was willing to bet that all the injured surprise was part of the ploy. Of course, I still had the Carlisle option, but now that I knew there was a chance that Edward would change me himself, I wanted it bad. He was such a cheater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy door cracked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hey, Bella.\" He sounded embarrassed at getting caught. \"I didn\u0027t know you were awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027ve just been waiting ior you to wake up so I could take a shower.\" I started to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Charlie said, flipping the light on. I blinked in the sudden brightness, and carefully kept my eyes away from the closet. \"Let\u0027s talk for a minute first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t control my grimace. I\u0027d forgotten to ask Alice for a good excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you\u0027re in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just about went crazy these last three days. I come home from Harry\u0027s funeral, and you\u0027re gone. Jacob could only tell me that you\u0027d run off with Alice Cullen, and that he thought you were in trouble. You didn\u0027t leave me a number, and you didn\u0027t call. I didn\u0027t know where you were or when��or if��you were coming back. Do you have any idea how�� how��\" He couldn\u0027t finish the sentence. He sucked in a sharp breath and moved on. \"Can you give me one reason why I shouldn\u0027t ship you off to Jacksonville this second?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. So it was going to be threats, was it? Two could play at that game. I sat up, pulling the quilt around me. \"Because I won\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now just one minute, young lady��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Dad, I accept complete responsibility for my actions, and you have the right to ground me for as long as you want. I will also do all the chores and laundry and dishes until you think I\u0027ve learned my lesson. And I guess you\u0027re within your rights if you want to kick me out, too��but that won\u0027t make me to go to Florida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turned bright red. He took a few deep breaths before he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to explain where you\u0027ve been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, crap. \"There was�� an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows in expectation of my brilliant explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI filled my cheeks with air and then blew it out noisily. \"I don\u0027t know what to tell you, Dad. It was mostly a misunderstanding. He said, she said. It got out of hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited with a distrustful expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, Alice told Rosalie about me jumping off the cliff��\" I was scrambling frantically to make this work, to keep it as close to the truth as possible so that my inability to lie convincingly would not undermine the excuse, but before I could go on, Charlie\u0027s expression reminded me that he didn\u0027t know arything about thecliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor oops. As if I wasn\u0027t already toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I didn\u0027t tell you about that,\" I choked out. \"It was nothing. Just messing around, swimming with Jake. Anyway, Rosalie told Edward, and he was upset. She sort of accidentally made it sound like I wa? trying to kill myself or something. He wouldn\u0027t answer his phone, so Alice dragged me to�� L.A., to explain in person.\" I shrugged, desperately hoping that he would not be so distracted by my slip that he\u0027d miss the brilliant explanation I\u0027d provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s face was frozen. \"Were you trying to kill yourself, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. Just having fun with Jake. Cliff diving. The La Push kids do it all the time. Like I said, nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s face heated up��from frozen to hot with fury. \"What\u0027s it to Edward Cullen anyway?\" he barked. \"All this time, he\u0027s just left you dangling without a word��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI interrupted him. \"Another misunderstanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face flushed again. \"So is he back then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure what the exact plan is. I think they all are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, the vein in his forehead pulsing. \"I want you to stay away from him, Bella. I don\u0027t trust him. He\u0027s rotten for you. I won\u0027t let him mess you up like that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie rocked back onto his heels. \"Oh.\" He scrambled for a second, exhaling loudly in surprise. \"I thought you were going to be difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\" I stared straight into his eyes. \"I meant, \u0027Fine, I\u0027ll move out.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes bulged; his face turned puce. My resolve wavered as I started to worry about his health. He was no younger than Harry��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, I don\u0027t want to move out,\" I said in a softer tone. \"I love you. I know you\u0027re worried, but you need to trust me on this. And you\u0027re going to have to ease up on Edward if you want me to stay. Do you want me to live here or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not fair, Bella. You know I want you to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then be nice to Edward, because he\u0027s going to be where I am.\" I said it with confidence. The conviction of my epiphany was still strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not under my roof,\" Charlie stormed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed a heavy sigh. \"Look, I\u0027m not going to give you any more ultimatums tonight��or I guess it\u0027s this morning. Just think about it for a few days, okay? But keep in mind that Edward and I are sort of a package deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think it over,\" I insisted. \"And while you\u0027re doing that, could you give me some privacy? I really need a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s face was a strange shade of purple, but he left, slamming the door behind him. I heard him stomp furiously down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw off my quilt, and Edward was already there, sitting in the rocking chair as if he d been present through the whole conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not as if I don\u0027t deserve far worse,\" he murmured. \"Don\u0027t start anything with Charlie over me, please. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" I breathed as I gathered up my bathroom things and a set of clean clothes. \"I will start exactly as much as is necessary, and no more than that. Or are you trying to tell me I have nowhere to go?\" I widened my eyes with false alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d move in with a house full of vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably the safest place for someone like me. Besides��\" I grinned. \"If Charlie kicks me out, then there\u0027s no need for a graduation deadline, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw tightened. \"So eager for eternal damnation,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you don\u0027t really believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t I?\" he fumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glowered at me and started to speak, but I cut him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you really believed that you\u0027d lost your soul, then when I found you in Volterra, you would have realized immediately what was happening, instead of thinking we were both dead together. But you didn\u0027t��you said \u0027Amazing. Carlisle was right,\u0027\" I reminded him, triumphant. \"There\u0027s hope in you, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once, Edward was speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let\u0027s both just be hopeful, all right?\" I suggested. \"Not that it matters. If you stay, I don\u0027t need heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up slowly, and came to put his hands on either side of my face as he stared into my eyes. \"Forever,\" he vowed, still a little staggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I\u0027m asking for,\" I said, and stretched up on my toes so that I could press my lips to his. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-25.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
