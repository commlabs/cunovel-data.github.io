I certainly don\u0027t want to see him dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy felt the way she had last night when herbody was starving for air. She was frozen, too stillto breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, do youwant him dead?\" Ash asked, as ifit were the most reasonable question in the world.Poppy shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" Ash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy got a breath at last. \"What are you saying?\"Then, without waiting for him to answer, she said, \"You\u0027re saying that they\u0027re going to kill him if theyfind out about me. But they don\u0027t haveto find out about me. Unless you tell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh glanced at his fingernails thoughtfully.. Hemade a face to show that this was as painful for himas it was for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go over the facts,\" he said. \"You are, in fact,a former human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, I was a vermin, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a droll look. \"Don\u0027t take that so seriously. It\u0027s what you are now that counts. But Jamesdid, in fact, change you without clearing it with anybody.Right? And he did, in fact, break cover and tellyou about the Night World before you werechanged. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know? Maybe he just changed mewithout telling me a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook a finger. \"Ah, but James wouldn\u0027t dothat. He\u0027s got these radical permissive ideas abouthumans having free will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you know all about it, why ask me?\" Poppysaid tensely. \"And if you\u0027ve got a point-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point is that he\u0027s committed at least two capital offenses. Three, I bet.\" He flashed the wild, handsome smile again. \"He must have been in love withyou to have done the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething swelled in Poppy like a bird trapped inher rib cage and trying to get out. She blurted, \"I don\u0027t see how you people can make laws about not falling in love! It\u0027s insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you see why? You\u0027re the perfect example. Because of love, James told you and then hechanged you. If he\u0027d had the sense to squash hisfeelings for you in the beginning, the whole thingwould have been nipped in the bud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if you can\u0027tsquash it? You can\u0027t forcepeople to stop feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Ash said, and Poppy stoppeddead. She stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips curved and he beckoned to her. \"I\u0027ll tellyou a secret. The Elders know they can\u0027t really legis late how you feel. What they can do is terrorize youso that you don\u0027t dare show your feelings-ideally, so you can\u0027t even admit them to yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy settled back. She\u0027d seldom felt so at a loss.Talking to Ash made her head whirl, made her feel as if she were too young and stupid to. be sure of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a forlorn and helpless gesture. \"Butwhat do I do now? I can\u0027t change thepast....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but you can act in the present.\" He jumpedto his feet in a lovely, graceful motion and beganpacing. \"Now. We have to think fast. Presumably everyone here thinks you\u0027re dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the answer is simple. You have to get out of jthe area and stay out. Go someplace where youwon\u0027t be recognized, where nobody will care ifyou\u0027re new or illegal. Witches. That\u0027s it! I\u0027ve got some cross-cousins in Las Vegas that will put you up. Themain thing is to leave now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy\u0027s head wasn\u0027t just whirling, it was reeling.She felt dizzy and physically sick, as if she\u0027d juststepped off Space Mountain at Disneyland. \"What? Idon\u0027t even understand what you\u0027re talking about,\"she said feebly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027I\u0027ll explain on the way. Come on, hurry! Do youhave some clothes you want to take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epoppy planted her feet solidly on the floor. Sheshook her head to try and dear it. \"Look, I don\u0027tknow what you\u0027re saying, but I can\u0027t go anywhereright now. I have to wait for James.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you see?\" Ash stopped his whirlwindpacing and rounded on her. His eyes were green andhypnotically brilliant. \"That\u0027s just what you can\u0027t do. James can\u0027t even know where you\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see?\"Ash said again. He spread hishands and spoke almost pityingly. \"You\u0027rethe only thing putting James in danger. As long as you\u0027re here, anybody can look at you and put the piecestogether. You\u0027re circumstantial evidence that he\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecommitted a crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy understood that. \"But I can just wait and James can go away with me. He would wantthat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it wouldn\u0027t work,\" Ash said softly. \"It doesn\u0027tmatter where you go; whenever you\u0027re together,you\u0027re a danger to him. One look at you and anydecent vampire can sense the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy\u0027s knees felt weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh spoke soberly. \"I\u0027m not saying that you\u0027ll bemuch safer yourself if you leave. You bring your owndanger with you, because of what you are. But aslong as you\u0027re away from James, nobody can connect you with him. It\u0027s the only way to keep him safe. Do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, I see that now.\" The ground seemed tohave disappeared beneath Poppy. She wasfalling,not into music, but into an icy dark void. There wasnothing to hold on to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, of course, it\u0027s a lot to expect, to ask you togive him up. You may not want to make that kindof sacrifice-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy\u0027s chin came up. She was blind and empty and giddy, but she spoke to Ash with utter contempt,spitting out the words. \"After everything he sacrificedfor me? What do you think I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh bowed his head. \"You\u0027re a brave one, littledreamer. I can\u0027t believe you were ever human.\" Then he looked up and spoke briskly. \"So do youwant to pack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have much,\" Poppy said, slowly, becausemoving and speaking hurt her. She walked towardthe bedroom as if the floor was covered with broken glass. \"Hardly anything. But I have to write a notefor James.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" Ash said. \"That\u0027s the last thing you wantto do. Well, after all,\" he added as she swiveledslowly to look at him, \"James being so noble andlovestruck and everything-if you let him knowwhere you\u0027re going, he\u0027ll come right after you. Andthen where will you be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy shook her head. \"I... okay.\" Still shakingher head, she stumbled into the bedroom.She wasn\u0027t going to argue with him anymore, but she wasn\u0027t going to take his advice, either. She shut the bedroom door and tried as hard as she could toshield her mind. She visualized a stone wall around her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuffing her sweat pants and T-shirt and whitedress into the duffel bag took thirty seconds. Thenshe found a book under the nightstand and a felt-tippen in the drawer. She tore the flyleaf out of thebook and scribbled rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear James,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m so sorry, but if I stay to explain this to you, I know you\u0027ll try to stop me. Ash has made me understand the truth-that as long as I stick around I\u0027mputting your life in danger. And I just can\u0027t do that.If something happened to you because of me, I woulddie. I really would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going away now. Ash is taking me somewherefar away where you won\u0027t findme. Where they won\u0027tcare what I am. I\u0027ll be safe there. You\u0027ll be safe here.And even if we\u0027re not together, we\u0027ll never really beapart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you. I\u0027ll love you forever. But I have to dothis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease tell Phil goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour soulmate, Poppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dripping tears onto the paper as shesigned it.She put the flyleaf on the pillow and went outto Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, there, there,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t cry. You\u0027redoing the right thing.\" He put an arm around hershoulders. Poppy was too miserable to shrug it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him. \"One thing. Won\u0027t I be putting youin danger if I go with you? I mean, somebodymight think youwere the one who made me an ille gal vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her with wide, earnest eyes. They happened to be blue-violet at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m willing to take that risk,\" he said. \"I have alot of respect for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames took the stairs two at a time, sending probing thoughts ahead of him and then refusing to believe what his own senses told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to be there. She hadto be....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pounded on the door at the same time as hewas thrusting the key into\u0027 the lock. At the same timeas he was shouting mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy! Poppy, answer me! Poppy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, even with the door flung open and hisown thoughts ricocheting off the emptiness in theapartment, he stilldidn\u0027t want to believe. He ran around, looking in every room, his heart thudding louder and louder in his chest. Her duffel bag was gone. Her clothes were gone. She was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ended up leaning against the glass of the livingroom window. He could see the street below, andthere was no sign of Poppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sign of Ash, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was James\u0027s fault. He\u0027d been following his mother\u0027s trail all afternoon, from decorating job to decorating job, trying to catch up with her. Only to find,once he did catch up, that Ash was already in Elcamino, and had, in fact, been sent over to James\u0027sapartment hours ago. With a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eputting him alone with Poppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames had called the apartment immediately. Noanswer. He\u0027d broken all speed limits getting backhere. But he was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh, you snake, he thought. If you hurt her, if youput one finger on her ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself roving over the apartment again,looking for clues as to what had happened. Then, in the bedroom, he noticed something pale against the light brown of the pillowcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA note. He snatched it up and read it. And gotcolder and colder with every line. By the time he reached the end, he was made of ice and ready tokill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were little round splashes where the felt-tippen had run. Tears. He was going to break one of Ash\u0027s bones for each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folded the note carefully and put it in hispocket. Then he took a few things from his closetand made a call on his cellular phone as he was walking down the stairs of the apartment building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, it\u0027s me,\" he said at the beep of an answering machine. \"I\u0027m going to be gone for a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething\u0027s come up. If you see Ash, leave me amessage. I want to talk with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say please. He knew his voice was clippedand sharp. And he didn\u0027t care. He hoped his tone would scare her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust at the moment he felt ready to take on hismother and father and all the vampire Elders in theNight World. One stake for all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t a child anymore. In the last week he\u0027dbeen through the crucible. He\u0027d faced death andfound love. He was an adult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd filled with a quiet fury that would destroyeverything in its path. Everything necessary to getto Poppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made other phone calls as he guided the Integraswiftly and expertly through the streets of El Camino.He called the Black Iris and made sure that Ashhadn\u0027t turned up there. He called several other blackflower dubs, even though he didn\u0027t expect to find anything. Poppy had said Ash was going to take her far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn you, Ash, he thought. Where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil was staring at the TV without really seeing it.How could he be interested in talk shows or infomercialswhen all he couldthinkabout was his sister?His sister who was maybe watching the same showsand maybe out biting people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the car screech to a stop outside and wason his feet before he knew it. Weird how he wasabsolutely certain of who it was. He must have cometo recognize the Integra\u0027s engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door as James reached the porch.\"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\" James was already heading for the car.There wasa deadly energy in his movements, abarely controlled power, that Phil had never seen before. White-hot fury, leashed but straining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames turned at the driver\u0027s side door. \"Poppy\u0027smissing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil threw a wild glance around. There was nobodyon the street, but the door to the house was open.And James was shouting as if he didn\u0027t care whoheard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the words sank in. \"What do you mean,she\u0027s-\" Phil broke off and jerked the door to thehouse shut. Then he went to the Integra. James already had the passenger door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, she\u0027s missing?\" Phil said assoon as he was in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames gunned the engine. \"My cousin Ash has taken her someplace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Ash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead,\" James said, and somehow Phillip knew he didn\u0027t mean Ash was one of the walkingdead. He meant Ash was going to bedead, completelydead, at some point very soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, where\u0027s he taken her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" James said through his teeth. \"Ihave no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil stared a moment, then said, \"Okay. Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t understand what was going on, but hecould see one thing. James was too angry and toointent on revenge to think logically. He might seem rational, but it was stupid to drive around at fifty five miles an hour through a residential zone with no idea of where to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was strange that Phil felt comparatively calmit seemed as if he\u0027d spent the last week being wacko while James played the cool part. But having someone else be hysterical always made Phil golevelheaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, look,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s take this one step ata time. Slow down, okay? We might be going in exactly the wrong direction.\" At that, James eased up on the gas pedal slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, now tell me about Ash. Why\u0027s he taking Poppy somewhere? Did he kidnap her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He talked her into it. He convinced her thatit was dangerous for me if she stuck around here. Itwas the one thing guaranteed to make her go withhim.\" One hand on the wheel, James fished in his pocket and handed a folded piece of paper to Phil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a page torn out of a book. Phillip read thenote and swallowed. He glanced at James, who wasstaring straight ahead at the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil shifted, embarrassed at having intruded on private territory, embarrassed at the sting in his eyes. Your soulmate, Poppy?Well. Well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loves you a lot,\" he said finally, awkwardly.\"And I\u0027m glad she said goodbye to me.\" He folded the note carefully and tucked it under the emergency brake handle. James picked it up and put it in hispocket again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ash used her feelings to get her away. Nobodycan push buttons and pull strings like he can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why would he want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First because he likes girls. He\u0027s a realDon Juan.\"James glanced at Phil caustically. \"And now he\u0027s gother alone. And second because he likes to play withthings. Like a cat with a mouse. He\u0027ll fool around with her for a while, and then when he gets tired ofher, he\u0027ll hand her over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip went still. \"Who to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Elders. Somebody in charge somewherewho\u0027ll realize she\u0027s a renegade vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then they kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil grabbed the dashboard. \"Wait a minute.You\u0027re telling me that a cousin of yours is going tohand Poppy over to be killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the law. Any good vampire would do thesame. My own mother would do it, without a second thought.\" His voice was bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s a vampire. Ash,\" Phil said stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames gave him a look. \"Allmy cousins are vampires,\" he said with a short laugh. Then his expression changed, and he took his foot off the gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the-hey, that was a stop sign!\" Philyelped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames slammed on the brakes and swung into aU-turn in the middle of the street. He ran over somebody\u0027s lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Phil said tightly, still braced againstthe dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames was looking almost dreamy. \"I\u0027ve just realized where they\u0027ve gone. Where he\u0027d take her. Hetold her someplace safe, where people wouldn\u0027t carewhat she was. But vampires wouldcare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027re with humans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Ash hates humans. He\u0027d want to take hersomeplace in the Night World, someplace where he\u0027sa big man. And the nearest city that\u0027s controlled bythe Night World is Las Vegas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil felt his jaw drop. Las Vegas? Controlled by theNight World? He had the sudden impulse to laugh. Sure, of course it would be. \"And I always thoughtit was the Mafia,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" James said seriously, swerving onto a freeway on-ramp. \"Just a different mafia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, look, wait. Las Vegas is a big city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not, actually. But it doesn\u0027t matter anyway. Iknow where they are. Because all my cousins aren\u0027tvampires. Some of them are witches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil\u0027s forehead puckered. \"Oh, yeah? And how didyou arrange that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t. My great-grandparents did, about fourhundred years ago. They did a blood-tie ceremonywith a witchfamily. The witches aren\u0027t my realcous ins; they\u0027re not related. They\u0027re cross-cousins.Adopted family. It probably won\u0027t even occur tothem that Poppy might not be legal. And that\u0027swhere Ash would go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re cross-kin,\" Ash told Poppy. They weredriving in the Rasmussen\u0027s gold Mercedes, which Ashinsisted his aunt Maddy would want him to take.\"They won\u0027t be suspicious of you. And witches don\u0027tknow the signs of being a new vampire the way vampires do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy just stared at the far horizon. It was evening now, and a lowering red sun was setting behind them. All around them was a weird alien landscape: not as brown as Poppy would have expected a desertto be. More gray-green, with clumps of green-gray. The Joshua trees were strangely beautiful, but alsothe closest thing to a plant made up of tentacles as she\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost everything growing had spikes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was oddly fitting as a place to go into exile. Poppy felt as if she were leaving behind not only herold life, but everything she\u0027d ever foundfamiliarabout the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of you,\" Ash said caressingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy didn\u0027t even blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip first saw Nevada as a line of lights in thedarkness ahead. As they got closer to the state line,the lights resolved into signs with blinking, swarming, flashing neon messages. Whiskey Pete\u0027s, they an nounced. Buffalo Bill\u0027s. The Prima Donna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome guy with a reputation for being a Don Juanwas taking Poppy in thisdirection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go faster,\" he told James as they left the lightsbehind and entered a dark and featureless desert.\"Come on. This car can do ninety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we are. Las Vegas,\" Ash said as if makingPoppy a present of the whole city. But Poppy didn\u0027tsee a city, only a light in the clouds ahead like the rising moon. Then, as the freeway curved, she sawthat it wasn\u0027t the moon, it was the reflection of city lights. Las Vegas was a glittering pool in a flat basinbetween the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething stirred in Poppy despite herself. She\u0027dalways wanted to see the world. Faraway places. Ex otic lands. And this would have been perfect-if onlyJames had been with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp close, though, the city wasn\u0027t quite the gem itlooked from a distance. Ash got off the freeway, and Poppy was thrown into a world of color and lightand movement-and of tawdry cheapness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Strip,\" Ash announced. \"You know, whereall the casinos are. There\u0027s no place like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet,\" Poppy said, staring. On one side of her wasa towering black pyramid hotel with a huge sphinxin front. Lasers were flashing out of the sphinx\u0027seyes. On the other side was a sleazy motor inn with a sign saying \"Rooms $18.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this is the Night World,\" she said, with a twingeof cynical amusement that made her feel very adult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah, this is for the tourists,\" Ash said. \"But it\u0027sgood business and you can do some fairly seriouspartying. I\u0027ll show you the real Night World, though.First, I want to check in with my cousins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy considered telling him that she didn\u0027t reallycare to have himshow her the Night World.Something about Ash\u0027s manner was beginning to bother her. He was acting more as if they were out on adate than as if he were escorting her into exile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027s the only person I know here, she realizedwith a dismayed sinking in her stomach. And it\u0027s notas if I have any money or anything--not even eighteen dollars for that crummy motel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something worse. She\u0027d been hungry for some time now, and now she was starting to feel breathless. But she wasn\u0027t the dazed, unthinking animal she\u0027d been last night. She didn\u0027t want to attacksome human on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the place,\" Ash said. It was a side street,dark and not crowded like the Strip. He pulled intoan alley. \"Okay, just let me see if they\u0027re in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn either side of them were high buildings withcinder-block walls. Above, tiers of power lines obscuredthe sky. Ash knocked at a door set in the cinder blocka door with no knob on the outside. There was no signon the door, either, just some crudely spray-paintedgraffiti. It was a picture of a black dahlia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy stared at a Dumpster and tried to controlher breathing. In, out. Slow and deep. It\u0027s okay,there\u0027s air. It may not feel like it, but there\u0027s air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Ash beckoned to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Poppy,\" Ash said, putting an arm aroundher as Poppy stumbled inside. The place looked likea shop--a shop with herbs and candles and crystals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lots of other weird things that Poppy didn\u0027t recognize. Witchy-looking supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And these are my cousins. That\u0027s Blaise, andthat\u0027s Thea.\" Blaise was a striking girl with masses ofdark hair and lots of curves. Thea was slimmer and blond. They both kept going out of focus as Poppy\u0027s vision blurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\"she said, the longest greeting she couldmanage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ash, what\u0027s wrong with you? She\u0027s sick. What have you been doing to her?\" Thea was looking atPoppy with sympathetic brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Nothing,\" Ash said, looking surprised, as ifnoticing Poppy\u0027s state for the first time. Poppyguessed he wasn\u0027t the type to worry about other peo ple\u0027s discomfort. \"She\u0027s hungry, I guess. We\u0027ll haveto run out and feed-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, you don\u0027t. Not around here. Besides,she\u0027s not going to make it,\" Thea said. \"Come on,Poppy, I\u0027ll be a donor this once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took Poppy by the arm and led her through abead curtain into another room. Poppy let herself betowed. She couldn\u0027t think anymore-and her wholeupper jaw was aching. Even the word feedsharpenedher teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need...I have to ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t know how. She had. a vision of her own face in the mirror, silvery eyes and savage canines. She didn\u0027t wantto be an animal again ,and jump on Thea andripher throat. And she couldn\u0027task how-that would give her away as a new vampire for sure. She stood, trembling, unable to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-secret-vampire-night-world-1/page-14.html","bookId":2076,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:34:35 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:34:35 AM"}
