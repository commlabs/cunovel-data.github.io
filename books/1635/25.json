Now, these things, in theory, when they detonate, not only make a big bang like you expect a nuke to—but they also force their tritium cases together in one big superheated and pressurized center.\" He made a fist and slammed it into his other palm for emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boosts the yield a hundredfold.\" A grin spread across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Planet killers. We had planned to use these things in space battles to level the playing field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin faded and he stroked his mustache. \"Well, things didn\u0027t quite turn out as planned, and we got caught flat-footed with those Novas on the ground. So I decided to repurpose them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson\u0027s face wrinkled with confusion. He didn\u0027t dare interrupt, but the Admiral saw his expression and said, \"Think, son. All that ordnance around with plenty of Covenant to blow up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaverson shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir. I still don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intelligence officer, huh?\" Whitcomb snorted and turned to the Master Chief. \"What would you have done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arm them, sir,\" the Master Chief replied. \"Activate the fail-safe tampering detonators and start a countdown timer. Say, two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral nodded. \"I gave it only ten days. There\u0027s no need to give them too much time to tinker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set one of his heavy hands on Lieutenant Haverson\u0027s shoulder, and Haverson flinched. \"They are two possible out- comes to this plan, Lieutenant. Either the Covenant pack up the Novas and take them home for study—a possibility I pray to God happens. A bomb like that would crack their home world in half. Or the bombs stay here—and they\u0027ll stop the Covenant on Reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see, sir,\" Lieutenant Haverson replied in a whisper, then glanced at his watch. \"This was how many days ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got plenty of time left,\" the Admiral told him. \"Around twenty hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just one snag in that plan, though.\" The Admiral removed his hand from Haverson and his gaze settled onto the dirt floor of the cavern. \"I had a team of Marines—Charlie Company—that got wiped out before we could get to those No- vas.\" He sighed. \"Brave kids. A damned waste of good men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I picked up Red Team on coded COM. I \u0027convinced\u0027 them to lend me a few of your Spartans. We got to the Novas, armed them, and we\u0027ve been raising eight kinds of hell down here with hit-and-run exercises—just to keep everyone busy, you understand. Wouldn\u0027t want to get bored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the rest of Red Team, sir?\" the Master Chief asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitcomb shook his head. \"We got one last transmission from them before they said they were falling back.\" He walked to the table, unrolled an old paper topological map, and pointed at Menachite Mountain. \"Here. Where ONI had their CASTLE base.\" He paused. \"But the Covenant are tearing that mountain apart, rock by rock. I want to believe they\u0027re still there ... but we\u0027ve counted at least a dozen companies. Those Covenant have air support, close orbit patrols, and, on the ground, armor. The place is a fortress. Could anyone survive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief scrutinized the lines on the map and had an answer for the Admiral. \"They\u0027re underground,\" he said. \"The CASTLE facility. We did a lot of training there. The Covenant can fill up those tunnels with only so many search parties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you think they all have a chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. More than a chance. I\u0027d guarantee they\u0027re in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s where I\u0027d be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral set his fingertip on the representation of Mena- chite Mountain, tapped it twice, thinking, and then suddenly looked up. \"You got into this canyon in a captured Covenant ship, right? A dropship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" John hadn\u0027t told him that. Despite his brusque manner, the Admiral knew his business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll go get them, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir!\" Lieutenant Haverson said. \"With all due respect, sir, our first priority should be to get back to Earth. The intelligence we\u0027ve gathered on the Halo construct, the technology aboard the flagship we\u0027ve captured ... Cortana\u0027s Slipspace calculations alone could turn the tide of this war for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know all that,\" the Admiral replied tersely. \"And you\u0027re three hundred percent correct, Lieutenant. But\"—he tapped the map again with his meaty forefinger—\"I won\u0027t leave a single man or woman behind on this planet for the Covenant to tear apart for sport. No way. And that goes double for a Spartan. We\u0027re going in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME:DATE RECORD ANOMALY\\Estimated 0610 hours, September 23,2552 (Military Calendar)\\ Aboard captured Covenant dropship, Epsilon Eridani system, en route to surface of Reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski accelerated the captured dropship to its maximum velocity—just under Mach 1. The craft arced up and joined the long convoy of Covenant ships—troop transports, scavenger drones, and Seraph fighters—as they descended from a higher orbit down to the surface. The formation of alien vessels headed straight toward Menachite Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant communiques scrolled across a screen next to the pilot\u0027s seat and then ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Incoming transmissions from the convoy . . . I guess they don\u0027t like strays,\" Polaski muttered calmly, looking at the Covenant calligraphy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not shooting,\" the Admiral said, gripping the back of Polaski\u0027s seat. \"We\u0027re fine. Just fly, Warrant Officer.\" He turned to the Master Chief. \"Get \u0027em ready, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief nodded and moved aft to the rest of the squad. His three Spartans as well as Lieutenant Haverson, Locklear, and Sergeant Johnson stood over an array of weapons laid out on the deck. Anton ticked off the inventory: \"Shotguns, a fuel rod gun, Jackhammer rocket launchers, plasma and HE pistols, and every type of grenade—take your pick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief picked up five clips of ammunition for his MA5B assault rifle, three frag grenades, and a shotgun for close work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing fancy—he wanted to keep it simple so he could keep one eye on the rest of his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocklear hefted the fuel rod gun, grunting from the exertion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weapon glowed an eerie green along its fuel casing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace relieved him of the too-heavy weapon and shouldered it with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure you get a handgun,\" the Chief told Locklear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be in close quarters underground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that,\" Locklear said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re close,\" the Admiral called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief moved up to the cockpit to watch. The line of dropships and drones maneuvered toward a pile of truck-sized stones that had been carved from the mountain. A spiraling hole, ten kilometers across, sat where Menachite Mountain had once risen majestic and impregnable, covered with forests and glaciers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only a strip mine now, with a single shaft drilled down its center. A Covenant cruiser hovered over the shaft, and the purple glow of a grav lift knifed into the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s our LZ,\" Whitcomb announced. \"Polaski, I want you to drive this crate straight down—but ease up a tad on the engines and let their grav beam do the work. It\u0027ll take us all the way down to whatever\u0027s at the bottom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With respect, Admiral,\" Polaski said, \"I\u0027m not sure we\u0027ll fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral squinted at the hole. \"We\u0027ll fit,\" he said. \"I have every confidence in you, Warrant Officer. Now make it quick. I don\u0027t think anyone topside is going to think us going down there is a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir!\" Her eyes locked onto the hole. \"No problem, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief marveled at the Admiral\u0027s lack of fear. He trusted the man\u0027s judgment; he had been criticized during his campaigns for unorthodox tactics and strategies, but his insight had been proven correct each time. The Master Chief, however, also had observed that the higher up the chain of command you received your orders, the more likely those orders would de- mand the near impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on,\" the Chief called back to his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski nosed the Covenant dropship over and plummeted into the dark purple scintillating grav beam. The instant they entered the field, the ship jumped, accelerated, and shuddered into the hole drilled through solid rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut off from the thin shreds of sunlight above, the ship went dark. The internal running lights glowed a faint blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got no room to maneuver in here,\" Polaski whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson climbed forward. \"Admiral Whitcomb, sir, I see how we can get in—assuming this hole leads somewhere— but it\u0027s the other part of your plan that\u0027s unclear. What\u0027s our exit strategy, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral\u0027s steely glare pinned Haverson. \"I\u0027ve got it fig- ured out. You just shoot when I tell you to and keep it all puck- ered up tight. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaverson clenched his jaw, looking extremely unsatisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski focused intently on the walls of the tunnel rushing toward her craft. \"Short-range sensors have a contact,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like the bottom of the shaft. ETA sixty seconds at this speed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral leaned closer to the Chief and whispered, \"We\u0027re gonna get hit heavy by whatever\u0027s down there. You make sure you hit them back three times harder. Then you get Anton on point and see if he can\u0027t locate your Spartans. I\u0027m guessing they\u0027ve gone to ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Chief could reply, the Admiral moved aft and grabbed an assault rifle and two HE pistols. He clipped plasma and frag grenades to his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty seconds,\" Polaski called out. She cut the engines, and the dropship coasted on the grav beam only. \"There\u0027s something down there,\" she said. \"Is that sunlight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dropship emerged into a titanic room—three kilometers across, circular, with a dozen galleries circumscribing the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, a holographic sun and a dozen moons wheeled along its domed ceiling. Except for the hole drilled into the mountain by the Covenant, the holographic projection was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral scrutinized the room, and his dark eyes locked onto a gathering of Covenant forces on the floor, near one edge of the great room. \"There,\" he said, and pointed. \"I make out about a hundred of them: a few Elites, Jackals, mostly Grunts. Looks like they\u0027re clearing a cave-in and not ready for company yet. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Polaski, land us half a kilometer from \u0027em and then dust off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you back in that hole ASAP. Plug it up. We don\u0027t want to leave our back door wide open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, sir,\" Polaski replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb addressed Li. \"You\u0027re our rear guard, son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay here and guard the ship with Polaski. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir! Yes, sir,\" Li replied. The Master Chief detected a hint of bitterness in the Spartan\u0027s voice for drawing what he undoubtedly would think was soft duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir dropship eased lower until it was a meter above the blue tiles of the room; the side hatches opened. The Chief jumped out first, followed by Anton, Lieutenant Haverson, and Locklear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the hatch on the opposite side leapt the Admiral, Sergeant Johnson, and Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dropship immediately rose into the hole in the ceiling, far enough in to be shielded from any stray ground fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move, everyone,\" the Admiral growled. He pointed at Grace and Locklear. \"You two, fire long-range weapons. Everyone else, haul ass. Take them out, people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral\u0027s plan was sound. He wasn\u0027t risking the dropship—their only means of escape—by landing too close to the enemy. They still had the element of surprise; the Covenant would have never anticipated an assault on the heart of their operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how long would this advantage last? How long before that cruiser blasted their dropship to atoms? The Covenant were not their most dangerous enemy. Time was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace paused, muscled the fuel rod gun to a forty-five-degree angle into the air, and launched a round. The alien weapon hissed and spat a glowing sphere of energy. The blast arced over the half-kilometer distance, impacted, and exploded in a green flash. Grunts and Jackals flew through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocklear fired two Jackhammer rockets, then dropped the spent launcher. The pair of rockets connected with a cluster of Elites who had—until a second ago—been running the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twin explosion obscured that end of the room with billow- ing clouds of dust, fire, and smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief motioned for his team to spread out and move forward at a jog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead there were silhouetted Grunts and Jackals in the dust clouds, screaming and shooting at the air, each other, anything that moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep moving,\" the Master Chief said. \"Move while they don\u0027t know what\u0027s hit them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton paused and knelt next to a set of tracks dug into the tiled floor. \"Kelly\u0027s been this way,\" he reported over the COM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief clicked on Red Team\u0027s COM frequency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly? Fred? Joshua? Spartans, acknowledge this signal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly static answered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred meters from the stunned Covenant work crew, a stray plasma bolt fired from the hazy, rubble-strewn region deto- nated a few meters from the Master Chief. He sent a spray of au- tomatic fire across the area, hoping to force the enemy to keep their heads down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace halted and fired the fuel rod gun again. A second glow- ing burst of radioactive energy flashed overhead and detonated along the far wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the intense light, the Master Chief saw that a dozen Jackals had braced themselves along the wall and overlapped their en- ergy shields to create a phalanx. Behind them five Elites readied plasma rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down,\" he shouted, and dived to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace hit the floor and rolled away. Plasma bolts sizzled over their heads, and the Master Chief\u0027s shields drained as a shot hit too close. The barrage turned several of the blue tiles around him into a crater of blackened glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grenades—up and over those shields, Spartans,\" Admiral Whitcomb bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief and Anton primed plasma grenades and hurled them from their prone positions. They hit the far wall and dropped into the cluster of Elites and Jackals— behind their shields. There was a pair of blue flashes, and the enemy formation blew apart. Jackals scattered and ran. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-25.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
