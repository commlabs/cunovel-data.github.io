Is this travesty all about you? About your petty rivalry? About placing blame?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can it not be about who\u0027s to blame?\" Maimun started to argue, but Arabeth cut him short with a vicious scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about those scattered on this field, nothing more,\" she said, her voice even. \"Alive and dead...in the Hosttower and without.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun swallowed hard and glanced at Robillard, who seemed equally out of venom, and indeed, Arabeth\u0027s argument was difficult to counter given the carnage around them. They finished extracting Deudermont at the same time that another rescue team called out that they had located Lord Brambleberry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground covering him had saved him from the explosion, but had smothered him in the process. The young Waterdhavian lord, so full of ambition and vision, and the desire to earn his way, was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be no cheering that day, and even if there had been, it would have been drowned out by the cries of anguish and agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork went on through the night and into the next day, separating dead from wounded, tending to those who could be helped. Guided by Robillard, assault teams went into each of the four fallen spires of the destroyed Hosttower, and more than a few of Arklem Greeth\u0027s minions were pulled from the rubble, all surrendering without a struggle, no fight left in them - not after seeing the unbridled evil of the man they\u0027d once called the archmage arcane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost had been horrific - more than a third of the population of the once-teeming city of Luskan was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the war was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Deudermont shook his head solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\" Regis yelled at him. \"You can\u0027t just say he\u0027s gone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many are just gone, my friend,\" Deudermont explained. \"The blast that took the Hosttower released all manner of magical power, destructive and altering. Men were burned and blasted, others transformed, and others, many others, banished from this world. Some were utterly destroyed, I\u0027m told, their very souls disintegrated into nothingness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what happened to Drizzt?\" Regis demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot know. He is not to be found. Like so many. I\u0027m sorry. I feel this loss as keenly as - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Regis yelled at him. \"You don\u0027t know anything! Robillard tried to warn you - many did! You don\u0027t know anything! You chose this fight and look at what it has gotten you, what it has gotten us all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Robillard growled at the halfling, and he moved threateningly at Regis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont held him back, though, understanding that Regis\u0027s tirade was wrought of utter grief. How could it not be? Why should it not be? The loss of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden was no small thing, after all, particularly not to the halfling that had spent the better part of the last decades by the dark elf\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could not know the desperation of Arklem Greeth, or that he was capable of such wanton devastation,\" Deudermont said, his voice quiet and humble. \"But the fact that he was capable of it, and willing to do it, only proves that he had to be removed, by whatever means the people of Luskan could muster. He would have rained his devastation upon them sooner or later, and in more malicious forms, no doubt. Whether freeing the undead from the magical bindings of Illusk or using his wizards to slowly bleed the city into submission, he was no man worthy of being the leader of this city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You act as if this city is worthy of having a leader,\" Regis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They stood arm in arm to win,\" Deudermont scolded, growing excited - so much so that the priest attending him grabbed him by the shoulders to remind him that he had to stay calm. \"Every family in Luskan feels grief as keen as your own. Doubt that not at all. The price of their freedom has been high indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their freedom, their fight,\" the halfling spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt marched with me willingly,\" Deudermont reminded Regis. That was the last of it, though, as the priest forcibly guided the captain out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You throw guilt on the shoulders of a man already bent low by its great weight,\" Robillard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He made his choices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As did you, as did I, and as did Drizzt. I understand your pain - Drizzt Do\u0027Urden was my friend, as well - but does your anger at Captain Deudermont do anything to alleviate it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis started to answer, started to protest, but stopped and fell back on his bed. What was the point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of Mithral Hall and felt that it was past time for him to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t even make out their physical shapes, as they seemed no more than extensions of the endless shadows that surrounded him. Nor could he distinguish the many natural weapons that each of the demonic creatures seemed to possess, and so all of his fighting was purely on instinct, purely on reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no victory to be found. He would stay alive only as long as his reactions and reflexes remained fast enough to fend off the gathering cloud of monsters, only as long as his arms held the strength to keep his scimitars high enough to block a serpentine head from tearing out his throat, or a clublike fist from bashing in the side of his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed a reprieve, but there was none. He needed to escape, but knew that was just as unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he fought, blades and growls denying his own mortality. Drizzt fought and ran, and fought some more and ran some more, always seeking a place of refuge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finding only more battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large black shape rose before him, six arms coming at him in an overwhelming barrage, and with overwhelming strength. Knowing better than to try to stand against it, Drizzt dived to the ground to the side, thinking to roll to his feet and rush around to attack the creature from another angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it had prepared for him, and when he hit the ground, he found his momentum stolen by a thick puddle of sticky mucus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature rushed over to him, rising to its full height, twice that of a tall man. It lifted all six of its thunderous arms out wide and high, and bellowed in anticipation of victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt wriggled an arm free and stabbed it hard in the leg, but that would hardly slow the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Guenhwyvar crashed into the side of its lupine head, though, all thoughts of finishing off the drow fled, as both panther and demon flew away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt wasted no time in extracting himself from the muck, muttering thanks to Guenhwyvar all the while. How lifted his spirits had been when he\u0027d realized the identity of his first encounter in that hellish place, when he\u0027d realized that Guenhwyvar had followed him through Arklem Greeth\u0027s gate. Together they had defeated every foe thus far, and as Drizzt closed in on the fallen behemoth, scimitars swinging, another demon found its premature victory cries muffled by its own blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt paused to crouch beside Guenhwyvar, though he knew they had to move along, and quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been so pleased to see her, so hopeful that his rescue was at hand by his dearest of companions, but he had come to regret that Guenhwyvar had come through, for she was as trapped as he, and surely as doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now, there\u0027s a good one,\" Queaser said to Skerrit through a mouth half-full of twisted yellow teeth. \"I\u0027ll get us a good bit for this, I\u0027d be guessin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d ye find then, ye dirty cow?\" Skerrit replied with an equally wretched grin, and one made worse since he was between bites of some rancid meat he had found in the pocket of a dead soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueaser motioned for Skerrit to come closer - the field was full of looting thugs, after all - and showed him an onyx figurine beautifully crafted into the likeness of a great black cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heh, but we should be thanking Deudermont for bringing so much opportunity our way, I\u0027m thinking,\" said a very pleased Skerrit. \"Three-hands\u0027ll give us a purse o\u0027 gold for that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueaser laughed and stuffed the figurine into a pouch under his dirty and ragged vest, instead of the large, bulging sack where he and Skerrit had placed the more mundane booty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get away,\" Queaser reasoned. \"If they\u0027re to catch us with the coin and the belts, that\u0027s our loss, but I\u0027m not for wanting this treasure tucked into the pocket of a Luskar guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get her sold,\" Skerrit agreed. \"There\u0027ll be more to find on the field tomorrow night, and the night after that, and after that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two wretches shuffled across the dark field. Somewhere in the darkness, a wounded woman, not yet found by the rescue teams, moaned pitifully, but they ignored the plea and went on their profitable way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pirate-king-transitions-2/page-18.html","bookId":2188,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:53:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:53:14 PM"}
