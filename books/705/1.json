{"id":11402,"no":1,"title":"INTRODUCTION.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The following pages are reprinted, with some alterations and additions, from the columns of the Freethinker. They are neither methodical nor exhaustive. I had the privilege of knowing Mr. Bradlaugh more or less intimately for twenty years. I have worked with him in the Freethought movement and stood by his side on many political platforms. It seemed to me, therefore, that if I jotted down, even in a disjointed manner, some of my recollections of his great personality, I should be easing my own mind and conferring a pleasure on many readers. Beyond that I was not ambitious. The time for writing Mr. Brad-laugh\u0027s life is not yet, but when it arrives my jottings may furnish a point or two to his biographer. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n G. W.
