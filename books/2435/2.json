Then she began to forge her way across campus, weaving around fellow students who were staking out their favorite benches. She could hear paper bags rustling and smell other peoples\u0027 lunches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s group hadn\u0027t been eating together these last two weeks-it caused too much talk. But today they had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey next, Jenny thought. She passed the amphitheater with its blistered wooden benches and looked into one of the home ec rooms. Audrey was taking interior decorating, and-of course-acing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny just stood in the doorway until Audrey, who was lingering with the teacher, looked up and caught her eye. Audrey shut her folder, dropped it in her backpack, and came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to get everybody,\" Jenny said. \"Do you have your lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Audrey didn\u0027t ask why they had to get everybody. She just shook spiky copper bangs out of her eyes with an expert toss of her head and pressed her cherry-glossed lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cut across the center of campus toward the girls\u0027 gym. The sun shone on Jenny\u0027s head, sending a little trickle of dampness down the back of her neck. Too hot for May, even in California. So why did she feel so cold inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Audrey peered into the girls\u0027 locker room. Dee wasn\u0027t even dressed yet, snapping towels and snickering with a couple of girls on the swim team. She was naked and completely unself-conscious, beautiful and lithe and supple as a jet-black panther. When she saw Jenny and Audrey looking at her significantly, she hiked an eyebrow at them, then nodded. She reached for a garnet-colored T-shirt and joined them a minute later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found Zach in the art block, standing alone outside the photography lab. That wasn\u0027t surprising -Zach was usually alone. What surprised Jenny was that he wasn\u0027t inside the lab, working. Zach\u0027s thin, intense face had always been pale, but these days it looked almost chalky, and in the last few weeks he\u0027d taken to wearing black cotton twills and shirts. He\u0027s changed, Jenny thought. Well, no wonder. What they\u0027d been through would have changed anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Jenny, who tilted her head in the general direction of the staff parking lot. The usual place. He gave a brief jerk of his head that meant agreement. He\u0027d meet them there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found Michael near the English block, picking up scattered papers and books from the concrete floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerks, porkers, bozos, Neanderthals,\" he was muttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did it?\" Jenny asked as Audrey checked Michael for bruises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carl Vertman and Steve Matsushima.\" Michael\u0027s round face was flushed and his dark hair even more rumpled than usual. \"It would help if you kissed it here, \"he said to Audrey, pointing to the corner of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee did a swift, flowing punch-and-kick to the air that looked like dancing. \"I\u0027ll take care of them,\" she said, flashing her most barbaric smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, we\u0027ve got to talk,\" Jenny said. \"Has anybody seen Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he cut this morning,\" Audrey said. \"He wasn\u0027t in history or English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonderful, Jenny thought as Michael got his lunch. Zachary was wearing Morbid Black, Michael was getting stomped, and Tom, the super-student, was cutting whole mornings-just when she needed him most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat down by the parking lot on what was commonly known at Vista Grande High as the grassy knoll. Zach arrived and dropped first his lunch sack, then himself to the ground, folding his long, thin legs in one easy motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s this girl,\" she said, and she did her best to describe the Crying Girl. \"Probably a ninth grader,\" she said. \"Do any of you guys know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all shook their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she said we killed Summer and hid her body, and that she knew that P.C. didn\u0027t do it. She sounded like somebody who really did know, and not just because she has faith in him or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s sloe-black eyes were narrowed. \"You think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think maybe she saw him that morning. And that means-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she knows where the paper house is,\" Michael said, looking more alarmed than excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she does, we have to find her,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny didn\u0027t blame him. Everything about their situation was awful. The way people looked at them now, the questions in people\u0027s eyes-and the danger. The danger that no one but their group knew about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of it was Jenny\u0027s fault. It had been her own brilliant idea. Let\u0027s tell the police the truth....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two policewomen. One was Hawaiian or Polynesian and model-beautiful. The other was a stocky motherly person. They both examined the pile of fragments around the sliding glass door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that doesn\u0027t have anything to do with Summer,\" Jenny said, and then she and Tom and Michael and Audrey explained it all again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it hadn\u0027t been a UFO. Well, it had been sort of like a UFO-Julian was alien, all right, but he hadn\u0027t broken the door. He had come out of a game-or at least he had sucked them into a game. Or at least-All right. From the beginning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had bought the game on Montevideo Avenue, in a store called More Games. Okay? She\u0027d bought it and brought it home and they had all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eopened it. Yes, they\u0027d all been here, the six of them, plus Summer. It had been a party for Tom\u0027s seventeenth birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside had been this cardboard house. This model. They had put it together, a Victorian house, three stories and a turret. Blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they\u0027d put these paper dolls inside that they\u0027d colored to look like themselves. Yeah, right, they were a little old to be playing with paper dolls. But it wasn\u0027t just a dollhouse. It was a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was to draw your worst nightmare and put it in a room of the house, and then, starting at the bottom, work your way up to the top. Going through each different person\u0027s nightmare as you went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had seemed like a good game. Only then it turned real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, real. Real. How many different ways were there to say real? Real!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had all sort of passed out, and when they woke up, they were in the house. Inside it. It wasn\u0027t cardboard anymore. It was solid, like an ordinary house. Then Julian had showed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was Julian? What was Julian, that was the question. If you thought of him as a demon prince, you wouldn\u0027t be too far off. He called himself the Shadow Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadow Man. Like the Sandman, only he brings nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, the point was that Julian had killed Summer. He made her face her worst nightmare, which was a messy room. Piles of garbage and giant cockroaches. Yes, it did sound funny, but it wasn\u0027t....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, none of them had read Kafka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, it wasn\u0027t funny because it had killed Summer. She\u0027d been buried in a garbage dump from hell, under piles of filth and rotting stuff. They\u0027d heard her screaming and screaming, and then finally the screaming had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body? For God\u0027s sake, where else would the body be? It was there, buried in rubbish, in the paper house, in the Shadow World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! The sliding glass door did not have anything to do with it. That had happened after they escaped from the Shadow World. Jenny had tricked Julian and locked him behind a door with a rune of constraint on it. When they got back to the real world, Jenny had put the paper house back in the game box, and then they\u0027d called the police. Yes, that was the call made at 6:34 this morning. While they were on the phone, they\u0027d heard glass breaking and come out to see two guys taking the box over the back fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would anybody want to steal the box? Well, these guys had been following Jenny when she bought the Game. And seeing the Game-it did something to you. Once you saw that glossy white box, you wanted it, no matter what. The guys had probably followed Jenny home just to get the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO, SUMMER DIDN\u0027T GO THAT WAY, TOO! SUMMER WASN\u0027T THERE! SUMMER WAS ALREADY DEAD BY THEN!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only after telling it that Jenny saw how crazy the story sounded. At first the police wouldn\u0027t believe that Summer was really missing, no matter how many times Tom demanded a lie detector test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police finally began to believe when they called Summer\u0027s parents and found that nobody had seen her since last night. By then Jenny and the others were sitting in the detective bureau around a large table with detectives\u0027 desks all around them. By then Jenny had picked out pictures of the two guys who\u0027d stolen the game. P.C. Serrani and Scott Martell, better known as Slug, a name he\u0027d chosen himself. They both had records for shoplifting and joyriding. P.C. was the one who\u0027d been wearing the bandanna and black leather vest, Slug the one in the flannels with the bad complexion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it turned out that they were both missing, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst part was when Summer\u0027s parents came down to the station to ask Jenny where Summer really was. They didn\u0027t understand why Jenny, who had known Summer since fourth grade, wouldn\u0027t tell them the truth now. The kids finally were given a drug-screening test because Summer\u0027s father insisted their story sounded exactly like things he\u0027d seen in the sixties. Like a very, very bad trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Parker-Pearson kept saying, \"Whatever Summer\u0027s done, it doesn\u0027t matter. Just tell us where she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba was the one who finally stopped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust at the point when the fuss got the biggest and noisiest, she appeared. She was wearing a brilliant orange garment that was more like a robe than a dress, and an orange headcloth like a turban. She was Dee\u0027s grandmother, but she looked like visiting royalty. She asked the police to leave her alone with the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jenny, shaking all over, told the story again. From the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over, she looked at each of them. At\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom, the champion athlete, sitting with his normally neat dark hair wildly tousled. At Audrey, the ever-chic, with her mascara rubbed off from sobbing. At Zach, the unshakable photographer, whose gray eyes were glassy with shock. At Michael, with his rumpled head in his arms. At Dee, the only one of them still sitting up straight, proud and tense and furious, her hair glistening like mica with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Jenny, who had looked back at her with a mute plea for understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Aba looked down at her own interlaced fingers, sculptor\u0027s fingers, long and beautiful even if they were knotted with age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you a lot of stories,\" she said to Jenny, \"but there\u0027s a famous one I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve heard. It\u0027s a Hausa story. My ancestors were those-who-speak-Hausa, you know, and my mother told me this when I was just a little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael slowly lifted his head from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once there was a hunter who went out into the bush, and he found a skull lying on the ground. He said, although he was really speaking to himself, \u0027Why, how did you get here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To his astonishment, the skull answered, \u0027I got here through talking, my friend.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom leaned forward, listening. Audrey stared. She didn\u0027t know Aba as well as the rest of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba went right on. \"The hunter was very excited. He ran back to his village and told everyone that he had seen a talking skull. When the chief of the village heard, he asked the hunter to take him to the marvelous skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the hunter took the chief to the skull. \u0027Talk,\u0027 he said, but the skull just lay there. The chief was so angry at being tricked that he cut off the hunter\u0027s head and left it lying on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once the chief was gone, the skull said to the severed head beside it, \u0027Why, how did you get here?\u0027 And the head replied, \u0027I got here through talking, my friend!\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the long silence afterward, Jenny could hear distant telephones ringing and voices outside the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean,\" Michael said finally, \"that we\u0027ve been talking too much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean that you don\u0027t need to tell everything you know to everyone. There is a time to be silent. Also, you don\u0027t have to insist that your view is the only one, even if you honestly believe it. That hunter might have lived if he\u0027d said, \u0027I think a skull talked to me, but I may have dreamed it.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we didn\u0027t dream it,\" Jenny whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Aba said then made all the difference. It made everything easier somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you,\" she said quietly and laid a gentle, knotted hand on Jenny\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the police came back, everyone was calm. Jenny\u0027s group now admitted that while they thought they were telling the truth, it could have been some sort of dream or hallucination. The police now theorized that something really had happened to Summer, something so awful that the kids just couldn\u0027t accept what they\u0027d seen, and so had made up a hysterical story to cover the memory. Teenagers were especially prone to mass hallucination, Inspector Somebody explained to Aba. If they could pass a lie detector test, proving they hadn\u0027t done anything to Summer ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the police released them into the custody of their parents, and Jenny went home and slept for sixteen hours straight. When she woke up, it was Sunday and Summer was still missing. So were Slug and P.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how the Center got started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new idea was that Slug and P.C. had made off with Summer, or that someone else had made off with all three. The local shopping mall donated space for a search center. Hundreds of volunteers went out looking in stormpipes and ditches and Dumpsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing Jenny could do to stop any of it. Every day the volunteers did more, the search got bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt awful. But then she realized something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer\u0027s body wasn\u0027t in a Dumpster-but the paper house might be. It wouldn\u0027t do any good searching for Summer, but it might do some good to search for Slug and P.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" she pointed out bleakly to Dee and the others, \"they got into the paper house, all right. And that means they might get up to the third floor. And that means they might open a certain door and let Julian out. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that they went out every day with the other volunteers, looking for a clue to where Slug Martell and P.C. Serrani might have taken the Game. It was a race against time, Jenny thought. To get to the house before Slug and P.C. got to Julian. Because after what she had done to Julian, tricking him and locking him behind that door, and after what she had promised him-telling him she\u0027d stay with him forever-and then running away ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he ever got out, he would find her. He\u0027d hunt her down. And he\u0027d take his revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the grassy knoll Michael was still groaning at the thought of finding the Crying Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She probably doesn\u0027t know anything,\" Zach said, his eyes gray as winter clouds. \"She probably just wonders if maybe we did it. Deep down, I think everybody wonders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked around at the group: Dee sprawled lazily on the grass, dark limbs gleaming; Audrey perched on a folder to save her white tuxedo pant-suit; Michael with his teddy-bear body and sarcastic spaniel eyes; and Zach sitting like some kind of Tibetan monk with a ponytail. They didn\u0027t look like murderers. But what Zach was saying was true, and it was just like him to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to go postering today anyway,\" Audrey said. \"We might as well look for this girl while we\u0027re at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to make any difference,\" Zach said flatly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-chase-the-forbidden-game-2/page-2.html","bookId":2435,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM"}
