With this conviction his original suspicion revived, and he made up his mind that Brown had robbed him after all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like to punch his head,\" thought Sam, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It did not occur to him that the deacon, from whom the money was originally taken, had the same right to punch his head. As I have said, Sam\u0027s conscience was not sensitive, and self-interest blinded him to the character of his own conduct.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His experience in smoking had given him a distaste for the Park, for this afternoon at least, and he made his way to the horse-cars determined to return. It did make him feel a little forlorn to reflect that he had no place to return to; no home but the streets. He had not yet contracted that vagabond feeling which makes even them seem homelike to the hundreds of homeless children who wander about in them by day and by night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was in due time landed at the Astor House. It was about four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and he had had nothing to eat since breakfast. But for the cigar, he would have had a hearty appetite. As it was, he felt faint, and thought he should relish some tea and toast. He made his way, therefore, to a restaurant in Fulton street, between Broadway and Nassau streets. It was a very respectable place, but at that time in the afternoon there were few at the tables. Sam had forty cents left. He found that this would allow him to buy a cup of tea, a plate of beefsteak, a plate of toast, and a piece of pie. He disposed of them, and going up to the desk paid his bill. Again he found himself penniless.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wonder where I am going to sleep,\" he thought. \"I guess I\u0027ll ask some boot-blacks where they live.

He began to feel lonely. He knew nobody in the great city except Clarence Brown, whom he did not care to meet again, and the boot-black whose acquaintance he had made the day before.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish I had some other boy with me,\" thought Sam; \"somebody I knew.

Sitting on the same bench with him—for he was in City Hall Park—was a boy of about his own age apparently.

He had temporarily forgotten the little adventure that preceded his departure from his country home. After all, why should he be so angry with Clarence Brown for doing the very same thing he had done himself? Why, indeed? But Sam had an answer ready. The deacon did not need the money, while he could not get along very well without it. So it was meaner in Clarence Brown to take all he had, than in him to take what the deacon could so well spare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I hope my readers understand that this was very flimsy and unsatisfactory reasoning.
