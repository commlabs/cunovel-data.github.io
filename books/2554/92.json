His original plan had gone off track in seemingly disastrous directions, and yet somehow ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis original intent had been simply to locate Glaeken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d known for years the identity of the Heir, although not where he lived. The plan had hinged on one all-important assumption: that the Heir knew the whereabouts of Glaeken. If that were so, Rasalom could use Dawn\u0027s baby as a means to locate Glaeken through the Heir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his discussions with Drexler he\u0027d known of the Connell woman\u0027s relationship to the Heir. So he had paired Dawn with the Connell woman, knowing the girl would be needy and would attach herself. He would eventually allow Dawn - with the Connell woman\u0027s help - to find her way back to her baby. The Connell woman would show the q\u0027qrlike child to the Heir. The Heir, if he knew Glaeken\u0027s whereabouts, would want him to see the child. And Rasalom would follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the revelations in North Carolina had made all that unnecessary: Glaeken turned out to be an impotent mortal and no threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich freed Rasalom to devote all his energies to eliminating the Lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when he realized that Dawn\u0027s baby could be used as a means to that very end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the Connell woman, he had learned where the Heir lived - a bit of information crucial to the plan. Once he had established that, he entered her apartment while she was out and inserted a new page about the Other Naming Ceremony into the Compendium, arranging for it to appear whenever the book was opened. The Connell woman couldn\u0027t help but find it, and couldn\u0027t help but bring it to Glaeken\u0027s attention. And to the Lady\u0027s as well, since she was the only living being - aside from Rasalom - who knew the Small Folk\u0027s language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had worded the page with caveats carefully tailored to leave the q\u0027qrlike child as the only safe recipient of the Other Name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heir and the Connell woman would go in search of Rasalom\u0027s ancient sigil, would find what they\u0027d believe was his Other Name, and the Lady would perform the Ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything had been working perfectly until the Heir\u0027s ferocious assault almost ruined everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause even though Rasalom had been maimed and had nearly lost his life, it had been worth it. The child had followed the path he\u0027d originally set for it: straight to Glaeken and the Lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went down on one knee and opened the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all these millennia ... time to end this. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-92.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
