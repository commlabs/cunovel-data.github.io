The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of shame left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; They have been eating muffins.\u0026nbsp; That looks like repentance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; [After a pause.]\u0026nbsp; They don’t seem to notice us at all.\u0026nbsp; Couldn’t you cough?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; But I haven’t got a cough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; They’re looking at us.\u0026nbsp; What effrontery!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; They’re approaching.\u0026nbsp; That’s very forward of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Let us preserve a dignified silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Certainly.\u0026nbsp; It’s the only thing to do now.\u0026nbsp; [Enter Jack followed by Algernon.\u0026nbsp; They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; A most distasteful one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; But we will not be the first to speak.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Certainly not.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.\u0026nbsp; Much depends on your reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me the following question.\u0026nbsp; Why did you pretend to be my guardian’s brother?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; [To Gwendolen.]\u0026nbsp; That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Yes, dear, if you can believe him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; I don’t.\u0026nbsp; But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; True.\u0026nbsp; In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother?\u0026nbsp; Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.\u0026nbsp; But I intend to crush them.\u0026nbsp; This is not the moment for German scepticism.\u0026nbsp; [Moving to Cecily.]\u0026nbsp; Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr. Worthing’s.\u0026nbsp; That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.\u0026nbsp; His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Then you think we should forgive them?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Yes.\u0026nbsp; I mean no.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; True!\u0026nbsp; I had forgotten.\u0026nbsp; There are principles at stake that one cannot surrender.\u0026nbsp; Which of us should tell them?\u0026nbsp; The task is not a pleasant one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Could we not both speak at the same time?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; An excellent idea!\u0026nbsp; I nearly always speak at the same time as other people.\u0026nbsp; Will you take the time from me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Certainly.\u0026nbsp; [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen and Cecily [Speaking together.]\u0026nbsp; Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier.\u0026nbsp; That is all!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack and Algernon [Speaking together.]\u0026nbsp; Our Christian names!\u0026nbsp; Is that all?\u0026nbsp; But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; [To Jack.]\u0026nbsp; For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; [To Algernon.]\u0026nbsp; To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I am!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!\u0026nbsp; Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; We are.\u0026nbsp; [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; They have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; [To Jack.]\u0026nbsp; Darling!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; [To Cecily.]\u0026nbsp; Darling!\u0026nbsp; [They fall into each other’s arms.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Enter Merriman.\u0026nbsp;

Good heavens!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Enter Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; The couples separate in alarm.\u0026nbsp; Exit Merriman.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen!\u0026nbsp; What does this mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Come here.\u0026nbsp; Sit down.\u0026nbsp; Sit down immediately.\u0026nbsp; Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.\u0026nbsp; [Turns to Jack.]\u0026nbsp; Apprised, sir, of my daughter’s sudden flight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.\u0026nbsp; Her unhappy father is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.\u0026nbsp; I do not propose to undeceive him.\u0026nbsp; Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.\u0026nbsp; I would consider it wrong.\u0026nbsp; But of course, you will clearly understand that all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this moment.\u0026nbsp; On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen Lady Bracknell!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; You are nothing of the kind, sir.\u0026nbsp; And now, as regards Algernon! . . . Algernon!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Yes, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury resides?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; [Stammering.]\u0026nbsp; Oh!\u0026nbsp; No!\u0026nbsp; Bunbury doesn’t live here.\u0026nbsp; Bunbury is somewhere else at present.\u0026nbsp; In fact, Bunbury is dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Dead!\u0026nbsp; When did Mr. Bunbury die?\u0026nbsp; His death must have been extremely sudden.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; [Airily.]\u0026nbsp; Oh!\u0026nbsp; I killed Bunbury this afternoon.\u0026nbsp; I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; What did he die of?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Bunbury?\u0026nbsp; Oh, he was quite exploded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Exploded!\u0026nbsp; Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?\u0026nbsp; I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.\u0026nbsp; If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!\u0026nbsp; The doctors found out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean—so Bunbury died.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.\u0026nbsp; I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.\u0026nbsp; And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr. Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.\u0026nbsp; [Lady Bracknell bows coldly to Cecily.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I beg your pardon?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]\u0026nbsp; I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance.\u0026nbsp; I think some preliminary inquiry on my part would not be out of place.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in London?\u0026nbsp; I merely desire information.\u0026nbsp; Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin was a Terminus.\u0026nbsp; [Jack looks perfectly furious, but restrains himself.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [In a clear, cold voice.]\u0026nbsp; Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; That sounds not unsatisfactory.\u0026nbsp; Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.\u0026nbsp; But what proof have I of their authenticity?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.\u0026nbsp; They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Grimly.]\u0026nbsp; I have known strange errors in that publication.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Miss Cardew’s family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Markby, Markby, and Markby?\u0026nbsp; A firm of the very highest position in their profession.\u0026nbsp; Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby’s is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.\u0026nbsp; So far I am satisfied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Very irritably.]\u0026nbsp; How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!\u0026nbsp; I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of Miss Cardew’s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.\u0026nbsp; I am not myself in favour of premature experiences.\u0026nbsp; [Rises, looks at her watch.]\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure.\u0026nbsp; We have not a moment to lose.\u0026nbsp; As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.\u0026nbsp; That is all.\u0026nbsp; Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; So pleased to have seen you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Sitting down again.]\u0026nbsp; A moment, Mr. Worthing.\u0026nbsp; A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!\u0026nbsp; And in the Funds!\u0026nbsp; Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.\u0026nbsp; Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time.\u0026nbsp; We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.\u0026nbsp; [To Cecily.]\u0026nbsp; Come over here, dear.\u0026nbsp; [Cecily goes across.]\u0026nbsp; Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.\u0026nbsp; But we can soon alter all that.\u0026nbsp; A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time.\u0026nbsp; I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; And after six months nobody knew her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Glares at Jack for a few moments.\u0026nbsp; Then bends, with a practised smile, to Cecily.]\u0026nbsp; Kindly turn round, sweet child.\u0026nbsp; [Cecily turns completely round.]\u0026nbsp; No, the side view is what I want.\u0026nbsp; [Cecily presents her profile.]\u0026nbsp; Yes, quite as I expected.\u0026nbsp; There are distinct social possibilities in your profile.\u0026nbsp; The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.\u0026nbsp; The chin a little higher, dear.\u0026nbsp; Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.\u0026nbsp; They are worn very high, just at present.\u0026nbsp; Algernon!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Yes, Aunt Augusta!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew’s profile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world.\u0026nbsp; And I don’t care twopence about social possibilities.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Only people who can’t get into it do that.\u0026nbsp; [To Cecily.]\u0026nbsp; Dear child, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.\u0026nbsp; But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.\u0026nbsp; When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.\u0026nbsp; But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.\u0026nbsp; Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Cecily, you may kiss me!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; [Kisses her.]\u0026nbsp; Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.\u0026nbsp; They give people the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the question.\u0026nbsp; I am Miss Cardew’s guardian, and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.\u0026nbsp; That consent I absolutely decline to give.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Upon what grounds may I ask?\u0026nbsp; Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.\u0026nbsp; He has nothing, but he looks everything.\u0026nbsp; What more can one desire?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.\u0026nbsp; I suspect him of being untruthful.\u0026nbsp; [Algernon and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Untruthful!\u0026nbsp; My nephew Algernon?\u0026nbsp; Impossible!\u0026nbsp; He is an Oxonian.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.\u0026nbsp; This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.\u0026nbsp; Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.\u0026nbsp; Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.\u0026nbsp; He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.\u0026nbsp; And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.\u0026nbsp; I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Ahem!\u0026nbsp; Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew’s conduct to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; My own decision, however, is unalterable.\u0026nbsp; I decline to give my consent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [To Cecily.]\u0026nbsp; Come here, sweet child.\u0026nbsp; [Cecily goes over.]\u0026nbsp; How old are you, dear?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; You are perfectly right in making some slight alteration.\u0026nbsp; Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age.\u0026nbsp; It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]\u0026nbsp; Eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.\u0026nbsp; Well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.\u0026nbsp; So I don’t think your guardian’s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather’s will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.\u0026nbsp; Thirty-five is a very attractive age.\u0026nbsp; London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.\u0026nbsp; Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.\u0026nbsp; To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.\u0026nbsp; I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present.\u0026nbsp; There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Of course I could, Cecily.\u0026nbsp; You know I could.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all that time.\u0026nbsp; I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.\u0026nbsp; It always makes me rather cross.\u0026nbsp; I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Then what is to be done, Cecily?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; I don’t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five—a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature—I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.\u0026nbsp; The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Rising and drawing herself up.]\u0026nbsp; You must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.\u0026nbsp; [Pulls out her watch.]\u0026nbsp; Come, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains.\u0026nbsp; To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; Everything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; The christenings, sir!\u0026nbsp; Is not that somewhat premature?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]\u0026nbsp; Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; At their age?\u0026nbsp; The idea is grotesque and irreligious!\u0026nbsp; Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.\u0026nbsp; I will not hear of such excesses.\u0026nbsp; Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I don’t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.\u0026nbsp; They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.\u0026nbsp; However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church at once.\u0026nbsp; Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Starting.]\u0026nbsp; Miss Prism!\u0026nbsp; Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; Yes, Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I am on my way to join her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.\u0026nbsp; This matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.\u0026nbsp; Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; [Somewhat indignantly.]\u0026nbsp; She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; It is obviously the same person.\u0026nbsp; May I ask what position she holds in your household?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; [Severely.]\u0026nbsp; I am a celibate, madam.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Interposing.]\u0026nbsp; Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew’s esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.\u0026nbsp; Let her be sent for.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; [Looking off.]\u0026nbsp; She approaches; she is nigh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.\u0026nbsp; I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.\u0026nbsp; [Catches sight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.\u0026nbsp; Miss Prism grows pale and quails.\u0026nbsp; She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [In a severe, judicial voice.]\u0026nbsp; Prism!\u0026nbsp; [Miss Prism bows her head in shame.]\u0026nbsp; Come here, Prism!\u0026nbsp; [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]\u0026nbsp; Prism!\u0026nbsp; Where is that baby?\u0026nbsp; [General consternation.\u0026nbsp; The Canon starts back in horror.\u0026nbsp; Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal.]\u0026nbsp; Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell’s house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.\u0026nbsp; You never returned.\u0026nbsp; A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.\u0026nbsp; It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.\u0026nbsp; [Miss Prism starts in involuntary indignation.]\u0026nbsp; But the baby was not there!\u0026nbsp; [Every one looks at Miss Prism.]\u0026nbsp; Prism!\u0026nbsp; Where is that baby?\u0026nbsp; [A pause.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.\u0026nbsp; I only wish I did.\u0026nbsp; The plain facts of the case are these.\u0026nbsp; On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.\u0026nbsp; I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.\u0026nbsp; In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Who has been listening attentively.]\u0026nbsp; But where did you deposit the hand-bag?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.\u0026nbsp; I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in London.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; What railway station?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; [Quite crushed.]\u0026nbsp; Victoria.\u0026nbsp; The Brighton line.\u0026nbsp; [Sinks into a chair.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I must retire to my room for a moment.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen, wait here for me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.\u0026nbsp; [Exit Jack in great excitement.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; I need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.\u0026nbsp; They are hardly considered the thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.\u0026nbsp; Every one looks up.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cecily.\u0026nbsp; Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; Your guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; This noise is extremely unpleasant.\u0026nbsp; It sounds as if he was having an argument.\u0026nbsp; I dislike arguments of any kind.\u0026nbsp; They are always vulgar, and often convincing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chasuble.\u0026nbsp; [Looking up.]\u0026nbsp; It has stopped now.\u0026nbsp; [The noise is redoubled.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; This suspense is terrible.\u0026nbsp; I hope it will last.\u0026nbsp; [Enter Jack with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]\u0026nbsp; Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?\u0026nbsp; Examine it carefully before you speak.\u0026nbsp; The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; [Calmly.]\u0026nbsp; It seems to be mine.\u0026nbsp; Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.\u0026nbsp; Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.\u0026nbsp; And here, on the lock, are my initials.\u0026nbsp; I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.\u0026nbsp; The bag is undoubtedly mine.\u0026nbsp; I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.\u0026nbsp; It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [In a pathetic voice.]\u0026nbsp; Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this hand-bag.\u0026nbsp; I was the baby you placed in it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; [Amazed.]\u0026nbsp; You?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Embracing her.]\u0026nbsp; Yes . . . mother!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp;

But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?\u0026nbsp; Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?\u0026nbsp; Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?\u0026nbsp; Mother, I forgive you.\u0026nbsp; [Tries to embrace her again.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Prism.\u0026nbsp; [Still more indignant.]\u0026nbsp; Mr. Worthing, there is some error.\u0026nbsp; [Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]\u0026nbsp; There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [After a pause.]\u0026nbsp; Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you.\u0026nbsp; You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon’s elder brother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Algy’s elder brother!\u0026nbsp; Then I have a brother after all.\u0026nbsp; I knew I had a brother!\u0026nbsp; I always said I had a brother!\u0026nbsp; Cecily,—how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?\u0026nbsp; [Seizes hold of Algernon.]\u0026nbsp; Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.\u0026nbsp; Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.\u0026nbsp; Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future.\u0026nbsp; You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.\u0026nbsp; I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Shakes hands.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp;
