And through all of that, the Lady’s Pull always remained as the last resort. Had Fiddler been a religious man, he would have been obliged, he well knew, to drop every single coin of pay and loot he earned into the coffers of the Lady’s temples, given how many times he had loosed a cusser at targets well within blast range of himself and countless other Malazans. Hedge had been even less… restrained. And, alas, his demise had therefore been of a nature succinctly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunsurprising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReminiscing had a way of arriving at the worst of moments, a glamour of nostalgia no doubt infused with subtle but alluring suicidal inclinations, and Fiddler was forced to push all such remembrances aside as he approached Cuttle and the last hole in the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You should have hightailed it out of here,’ Fiddler said as he settled down beside the modest excavation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No chance of that,’ Cuttle replied in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you like, then, but don’t be standing there at Hood’s Gate if I mess this one up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I hear you, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, trying not to think of Hedge, of Whiskeyjack, Trotts and all the rest; trying not to think of the old days, when the world still seemed new and wondrous, when taking mad risks was all part of the game, Fiddler, the last great saboteur, went to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle squinted at the farmhouse. Someone or ones inside there, he was sure enough of that. Living, breathing folk, oh yes. But… something, a faint odour, charnel recollections, or… whatever. He wasn’t sure, couldn’t be sure, and that made him seriously uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler had moved up beside him, had lain there patient as a tick on a blade of grass, at least to start. But now, a hundred or more heartbeats on, Bottle could sense the man growing restless. Fine enough for him, with that gold skin that didn’t burn once in Y’Ghatan-of course, Truth had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshown that the strange skin wasn’t truly impervious, especially when it came to Moranth munitions. Even so, Gesler was a man who had walked through fire, in every permutation of the phrase Bottle could think of, so all of this skulking and trickery and brutal slaughter was fine for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m the one they’re all counting on, and I couldn’t use this stupid sword at my belt to hack my way clear of a gaggle of puritanical do-gooders with their pointing fingers and sharp nails and all-gods below, where did that image come from? Damned Mockra, someone’s leaking thoughts. Bottle glanced over at Gesler. ‘Sergeant?’ he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Got strange notions in your skull, by any chance?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA suspicious glance, then Gesler shook his head. ‘Was thinking of an old mage I knew. Kulp. Not that you remind me of him or anything, Bottle. You’re more like Quick Ben, I think, than any of us are comfortable with. Last 1 saw of Kulp, though, was the poor bastard flung head over heels off the stern rail of a ship-in a firestorm. Always wondered what happened to him. I like to think he made it just fine, dropping out of that furnace of a warren and finding himself in some young widow’s back garden, waist-deep in the cool waters of her fountain. Just as she was on her knees praying for salvation or something.’ All at once he looked embarrassed and his gaze flicked away. Aye, I paint pretty pictures of what could be, since what is always turns out so damned bad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle’s grunt was soft, then he nodded. ‘I like that, Sergeant. Kind of… relieves me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Meaning?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Only, shows that you’re not as far from the rest of us as it sometimes seems.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler grimaced. ‘Then you’d be wrong, soldier. I’m a sergeant, which makes me as far from you and these other idiots as a cave bear from a damned three-legged stoat. Understood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now why are we still hiding here? There’s smoke trickling up from that chimney, meaning we got folks inside. So, give us the damned go-ahead on this, Bottle, then your task’s done, for now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right. I think there’s two in there. Quiet, contemplative thoughts, no conversation yet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Contemplative? As in what a cow thinks with a bellyful of feed in her and a calf tugging wet and hard at a teat? Or like some kind of giant two-headed snake that’s just come down the chimney and swallowed up old Crud-nails and his missus?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Somewhere in between, I’d say.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler’s expression turned into a glare; then, with a snort, he twisted round and hand-signalled. A moment later Uru Hela crawled past Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas-who was directly behind the sergeant-and came up on Gesler’s left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-278.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
