It was easy for the major races to form opposing factions, especially since humans and Giant Demons were mortal enemies; it was normal for them to target each other in the arena. However, in most cases, it was the human side that was defeated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was because the humans in the Heavenly Demon Cities were weak on an individual level, and there were also far fewer of them than the Giant Demons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was true that the population of humans far surpassed all others on the Holy Demon Continent. But among the humans, there were fewer that walked the killing path, and their talent was also relatively lower. Thus, there weren’t too many human martial artists that ventured to Polaris City.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the other hand, not only was the Giant Demon race filled with geniuses, but the vast majority of them chose the killing path. Thus, a massive amount of outstanding Giant Demon youths existed in Polaris City.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of these reasons, humans in Polaris City were in a naturally weaker position with no status at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the Ferals, they weren’t much better than the humans. They were naturally slow and lacking in perception, so no matter what cultivation method they practiced it was less effective. So, there were fewer Feral talents, and less that walked the killing path.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt could be said that beside Polaris City, the other Heavenly Demon Cities were all the worlds of the Giant Demons. Besides the Giant Demons, Imps also accounted for a small role. As for the Fey, there were few of them, but by virtue of their formidable individual strength, no one dared to provoke them. Even the arrogant and mouthy Giant Demons didn’t dare to spout nonsense in front of the Fey. A truly powerful Fey was ruthless to the point of eating others without spitting bones.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Just too weak.” At this time, several beautiful Fey women were merrily laughing in the stands.

None of them jumped onstage to confront Zha Na. Zha Na was among the strongest of the strong of Skysplit Tower’s first level. Although these Ferals had inferior perception, they weren’t stupid. They knew when they could fight and when they couldn’t, otherwise they wouldn’t have lived up to now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let\u0027s go.” Several human martial artists couldn’t withstand the pressure and wanted to leave the arena.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ugh, they really are useless. They can’t even withstand this sort of pressure, and yet they still say they want to walk the killing path?

A smaller human martial artist in his twenties almost couldn’t stand the repeated insults and was about to jump up onstage himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Don’t be reckless!” An older, black-clothed martial artist pushed down that smaller martial artist’s hands.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hey, boy, do you have the balls to come up?” Zha Na gloated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, Lin Ming calmly stood up.

Lin Ming wanted to pass it quickly, he didn’t want to get caught up here for any longer than he needed. His figure flashed and he flew onstage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the several human martial artists finally saw their fellow comrade enter the stage, they were happy. But, as they discovered Lin Ming’s cultivation, all of them were stunned. That excitement and happiness also sunk into a deep gloominess.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Early Xiantian realm…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough they could see that Lin Ming’s true essence was pure and thick, far exceeding that of any other early Xiantian realm martial artist, the fact was that his cultivation was too low. Between humans and Giant Demons, even when humans were at the same realm or a bit higher than a Giant Demon, they would still be weaker. Much less, Lin Ming’s cultivation was lower than his opponent’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This…” A human martial artist’s complexion turned ugly, he didn’t know what to say. Lin Ming had a good future, but now that he acted this time, he had presented himself to the slaughter. This meaningless death would only allow the Giant Demons to laugh at them more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs they expected, as the Giant Demons and Imps saw Lin Ming jump onstage, they were stunned at first and then they all immediately burst into laughter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There aren’t any humans left?

Come to big sister here, this big sister will take great care of you.” A curved and charming Fey woman giggled. In Polaris City, even if one were a human martial artist, they would usually be bloodthirsty and vicious; there were very few that were handsome.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the stage, Lin Ming turned a deaf ear to these comments.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZha Na crossed his arms across his chest and looked at Lin Ming with relish in his eyes. “Hehe, in Polaris City, there are plenty of idiots that bite off more than they can chew, but I haven’t seen someone as stupid as you. An early Xiantian boy thinks that he can challenge me? Is this your first time out of your sect? Do you think that all the other martial artists here are the same as the garbage in your sect, the type that you can jump realms to defeat?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming impatiently looked at Zha Na and asked, “Are you here to fight or are you going to continue blabbering?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs soon as Zha Na heard Lin Ming’s words, he scowled. His eyes flashed with killing intent as he said to Lin Ming, “Arrogant little boy, you don’t know what it means to die! I’ll deliver you to hell!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZha Na suddenly flourished a large axe and chopped down on Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe majesty of the axe combined with the roiling demon essence behind it. It was similar to a roaring ancient vicious beast, blowing in the wind. As Lin Ming stood there, he could faintly hear the screeching of countless souls within the demon essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming traced his spatial ring, and the Purple Comet Spear appeared.

He thought that he would be able to split Lin Ming in two with a single strike, but he never imagined that he would be the one that was suppressed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ghost Shadow Cut!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Zha Na saw the massive crimson python rush towards him, his eyes flashed with a grim light.

He instantly drew back, the blood in his body swelling. He had barely managed to force back the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder, and at this moment, his mind filled with panic and fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow could this boy possibly be so strong!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that split second, Lin Ming didn’t give Zha Na the chance to recover. He instantly stepped forwards, his momentum exploding.

In the future, he would face all sorts of opponents. If his moves were all revealed, then he would naturally be in a much more dangerous situation. Thus, he repeatedly used the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder. The Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder was originally a power of thunder biased towards the demonic path; it was good for supplementing demonic cultivation methods. At this time, it was especially suitable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“F*ck off!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZha Na roared.
