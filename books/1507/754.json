{"id":53079,"no":754,"title":"Chapter 750: Severing Karma","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[/expand]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral hundred figures with inhuman, demonic bodies charged forward. Their speed increased dramatically, and their cultivation bases climbed higher by a whole stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong their number were four Nascent Soul stage cultivators who grew to an incredible and powerful level. They were now thirty meters tall, with cultivation bases similar to Spirit Severing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the transformation, the weakest of the cultivators was at Core Formation, with most being in the Nascent Soul stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power to do such a thing could be considered top rate for any sect or clan. It was something that no power would look down upon during a fight. In fact, an ability like this could easily change the balance of power in a battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was especially true for the four Spirit Severing cultivators. Currently, the remaining Dao Seeking cultivators in the Southern Domain refused to show themselves, so if a Spirit Severing cultivator so much as stomped his feet, it would cause a huge commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered, and behind him, the killing intent of the tens of thousands of Blood Demon Sect disciples surged. They had come here for revenge. When it came to the people who had besieged and battled them, they faced either destruction or assimilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only these two choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face was calm as he looked at the hundreds of people charging forward. He did not attack them personally. Instead, he waved his sleeve and coolly said, “Exterminate them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, roars filled the air behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!” howled the Blood Demon Sect disciples. Instantly, tens of thousands of cultivators unleashed divine abilities and magical techniques. In the blink of an eye, colorful ripples exploded out in all directions. Their magic was like floodwaters that swept through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fog rumbled and cracked, and the hundreds of people inside were instantly shredded into a haze of blood and gore, with the exception of the four Spirit Severing cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the result of the combined power of tens of thousands of cultivators. The hundreds of strange, mutated cultivators that belonged to the Black Sieve Sect, despite being powerful enough to constitute the backbone of any Sect’s fighting forces, were simply incapable of withstanding even one of their attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling echoed out, and blood sprayed from the mouths of the four Spirit Severing enemies who had just been raised from the Nascent Soul stage. However, they did not fear death, nor did they do anything to evade. Instead, they charged forward in a frenzy and then… chose to self detonate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlames burst out on their skin, and a shocking pressure emanated out from them. Countless beams of brilliant light shone out as they prepared to blow themselves up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression remained completely the same as these four seemingly Demonic Spirit Severing cultivators detonated. It was in this moment that his second true self appeared. He raised his right hand, splayed his fingers and pushed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge boom could be heard as the four Demons exploded, the power of which transformed into an attack that made the fog seethe and the air split open. A multicolored mushroom cloud began to rise up, within which was flesh and blood, as well as incredible destructive power. However, the power of the mushroom cloud attack was met by Meng Hao’s second true self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he faced the expanding mushroom cloud, the second true self slowly began to close his hand into a fist. As he did, the mushroom cloud stopped expanding, and then began to shrink down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the second true self’s hand was fully closed into a fist, the destructive power of the self-detonation, the mushroom cloud, was completely suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second true self clenched his fist violently, and a boom could be heard. The destructive mushroom cloud suddenly… faded away into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of this instantly roused the spirits of the Blood Demon Sect cultivators. As for the hundreds of thousands of Southern Domain cultivators further back, their faces filled with astonishment, and they gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This clone of the Blood Demon Sect’s Blood Prince… is so… is so… completely terrifying!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The power of four Spirit Severing cultivators’ self-detonation was crushed by a single palm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder the joint attack of the four great powers was incapable of defeating the Blood Demon Sect. Not only that, they sealed themselves away from the world after the war was over! The Blood Demon Sect… is too powerful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment that the hundreds of cultivators were defeated, the fog churned, then began to rise up. Up in midair, it transformed into an enormous beast that stood on two legs and resembled a black bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was completely ferocious in appearance. Although it had no horns, its enormous fangs were shocking. Mist swirled around it as it roared and then charged toward the Blood Demon Sect, its eyes bright red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocking pressure emanated out from the mist beast, and although it did not emanate any sort of natural law, the feeling Meng Hao got from it was that of Dao Seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the mist condensed and formed this beast , the Ninety Nine Mountains of the Black Sieve Sect were revealed, and at their center, a huge rift in the ground could be seen, from within which black fog emanated out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep within that rift was the figure that Meng Hao had seen earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Left Dharma Protector, slay this mist beast,” said Meng Hao coolly. To the left of him was what had once been the Golden Frost Sect Patriarch. His eyes were the color of blood as he unhesitatingly strode forward toward the mist beast and lifted his hand. A tiny mountain appeared, which was the Golden Frost Sect’s legacy precious treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as the two clashed in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right Dharma Protector, go kill the bastard hiding in that rift.” The Blood Clone that was formed from the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch shot forward, a bloodthirsty gleam in his eyes. The Li Clan’s legacy precious treasure, a Feng Shui compass, rotated around him as he headed toward the rift in the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms echoed out as Meng Hao floated in midair, declining to participate in the battle. His two peak Dao Seeking Dharma Protectors were enough to sweep across the Southern Domain and slaughter everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the Blood Demon Sect, unifying the Southern Domain would be a extremely simple task, and that was exactly what Meng Hao intended to do. Exert incredible pressure on all the sects and clans of the Southern Domain, and unite the entire land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled the sky as the mist beast, incapable of standing up to the divine abilities of the Golden Frost Sect Patriarch, was defeated in the space of only seven or eight breaths. In the end, it exploded, transforming into countless streams of fog that dissipated in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderground, booming explosions rang out, followed by bellows of rage. The corpse wearing the imperial robes was now battling the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch. Currently, ripples of the peak Dao Seeking stage were now emanating off of the corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two of them fought back and forth, the ground quaked, and the rift was torn open even wider. The corpse’s enraged shouts grew louder, and then Meng Hao waved a finger, sending the Golden Frost Sect patriarch into the rift to join the fight. Now, it was two against one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was little to be suspenseful about. After enough time had passed for half an incense stick to burn, the withered corpse suffered defeat after defeat. Howling with rage and frustration, it called out, “Meng Hao…. Just leave! I don’t care that you’re a Demon Sealer any more! How about we just leave each other alone!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we keep fighting this way, you might win, but one of your men will be seriously injured, maybe even killed! Let’s call it quits, how about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t care that I’m a Demon Sealer?” said Meng Hao coolly. “Well I do!” His second true self’s eyes glittered as he took a step forward, then suddenly teleported into the rift. In the blink of an eye, more thunderous explosions could be heard from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe withered corpse let out an exclamation of shock. The ground quaked, and more rifts snaked out across the land. Even some of the mountains began to crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Black Sieve Sect was in a horrible state. Mountains were toppling, and the land was being torn apart. Grand palaces and other buildings that had just recently been rebuilt were now falling to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge crater then appeared, which began to swallow up the Ninety Nine Mountains. Four beams of light shot up from within it, one up ahead, three following. The withered corpse was in the lead, blood streaming from his mouth, his entire body in tattered and wounded. His expression was one of astonishment as he fled. Behind him were Meng Hao’s second true self and two Dharma Protectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three combined their attacks to shocking effect, making it impossible for the withered corpse to flee. He was sent tumbling through the air, whereupon the second true self appeared off to the side, Wooden Time Sword shining brightly. The withered corpse was terrified in the extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the three closed in, the withered corpse’s eyes suddenly filled with madness. He lifted his right hand up and then tore open a hole in his chest, revealing his withered innards. In the same location as his heart, shockingly, there was a tiny black imp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pitch-black imp had three eyes, no nose and a wide mouth, and it appeared to have grown up along with the heart itself. Its three eyes opened to reveal a bizarre glow. It immediately flew out into the air, after which the withered corpse trembled. All of the life force seemed to have been sucked out of it, and it died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the withered corpse died, the imp shot up into the sky. It hovered there, looking down coldly at Meng Hao, its eyes filled with grimness and hatred. Apparently, it was committing Meng Hao’s image to memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis development caused Meng Hao to gape in shock. The surrounding cultivators were also astonished. Who would ever have thought that hidden inside of the withered corpse was something as bizarre as this imp?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Sealer….” said the imp, its voice high-pitched. “As emperor, I will never forget this. Sooner or later, I’ll make you pay! For now… I’m leaving, and nobody can stop me!” With that, it looked up, apparently preparing to shoot up into the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Left and Right Dharma Protectors unleashed divine abilities to obstruct its way. However, the pitch-black imp smiled mockingly, and did nothing to evade the divine abilities. Instead, he shot directly through them, and sustained no damage in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s second true self gave a cold snort and then attacked. Magical symbols formed into the shape of a parasol, which emanated brilliant light. The imp’s pupils constricted, and it let out a piercing shriek. Suddenly, massive quantities of black fog poured out from it and shot toward the parasol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom rang out as the parasol of magical symbols collapsed into pieces. The imp’s fog was melted, leaving it visibly weakened. However, it was now high in the sky. It glanced back at Meng Hao and then turned to fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered as he experienced a menacing sensation. He wasn’t sure where this pitch-black imp came from, but there was something about it that filled him with a feeling of grave crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t let him escape!” he thought. His right hand shot up into the air, and he waved his finger toward the imp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEighth Demon Sealing Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe imp suddenly shuddered to a stop. However, it took only a moment of struggling to free itself. Its piercing voice rang out again, “You want to hex me? Your cultivation base isn’t strong enough!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that his opponent was about to disappear, Meng Hao took a deep breath and then calmed himself. He stretched out his right hand toward the sky, and then made a chopping motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind was now devoid of everything except for Karma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventh Demon Sealing Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHex of Karma!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Ner Olyk and Gregor Kolm\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-749\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-751\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-750","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
