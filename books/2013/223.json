Good eye, brother.’ The Beneda warrior dismounted with obvious relief, passing the reins over to Trantalo, then strode towards the steps. ‘Blood-trail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps a mutiny?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Edur had left their horses with one of their company and were now moving out across the courtyard to search the stables, smithy, coop and well-house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEstav stood at the base of the steps, eyes on the ground. ‘A body has been dragged outside,’ he said, tracking the blood-trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrantalo saw his brother’s head lift to face the stable. As it did Estav grunted suddenly, then abruptly sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Estav?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrantalo looked out to the courtyard, in time to see four warriors crumple. Sudden shouts from the three near the stables, as something like a rock sailed down into their midst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of fire. A solid, cracking sound. The three were thrown onto their backs. As a small cloud bloomed, there was shrieking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrantalo kicked his boots free of the stirrups, swung one leg over then dropped down into a crouch. His mouth was dry as tinder. His heart pounded so hard in his chest he felt half deafened by its drumbeat. Drawing his sword, he hurried over to his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Estav?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting, legs out before him in the careless manner of a child, hands resting on the muddy ground. Something was jutting from his chest. A hand’s length of a shaft, thicker than a normal arrow, the fletching curved fins of leather. Blood had poured down from Estav’s mouth, covering his chin and soaking into the front of his woollen cloak. His staring eyes did not blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Estav?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the courtyard, the sharp clash of blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisbelieving, Trantalo dragged his eyes from his brother’s corpse. Two Edur warriors were attempting a fighting withdrawal, backing towards the uneasy horses that still stood five or so paces in from the gate. The Edur who had been left with them was on his hands and knees, crawling for the opening. There was something jutting from the side of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifficult to make out who the attackers were in the darkness, but they were well armed and armoured, four in all, maintaining close contact with the last two Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmudged movement behind them-Trantalo leapt to his feet, about to cry out a warning, when sudden fire filled his throat. Gagging, he lurched away and felt something cold slide out from the side of his neck. Blood gushed down, inside and out. Coughing, drowning, he fell to one knee, almost within reach of his brother. Blindness closing in, he lunged towards Estav, arms outstretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEstav?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaging a straight line, Hellian walked out from the stable. She was slightly shivering, now that the time of serious sweating had passed. Fighting always evened her out. She didn’t know why that was the case, but it was and all in all probably a good thing, too. ‘Someone light a damned lantern,’ she growled. ‘You, Maybe, put that sharper away-we got ‘em all.’ She let out a loud sigh. ‘The big nasty enemy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing nearer the two Edur down in front of the keep, she waved her sword. ‘Tavos, check those two. It ain’t enough to stab ‘im then just stand there looking down. Might be one last bite in ‘im, you know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Both dead as my sex-life,’ Tavos Pond said. ‘Who sniped the first one, Sergeant? Damned fine shot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lutes,’ she replied, now watching Urb lead the others on a walk-past of the Edur bodies in the courtyard. ‘Leaned the weapon on my back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your back?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was throwing up, if it’s any of your business. Between heaves, he let go. Got him dead centre, didn’t he?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you didn’t want t’bring the rum. Well, that’s why I’m in charge and you’re not.
