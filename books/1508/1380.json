Empyrean Primordius’ disciples studied the Dao of grandmist.

This sort of power was extremely similar to the power of divinity that he withstood when he climbed up the Divine Seal Altar in the past. In truth, this so-called power of divinity was the combined strength of essence, energy, and soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It is indeed the power of divinity.

Behind Lin Ming, the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower slowly bloomed.

Beautiful divine lights began to shine outwards. Within the darkness of the Eternal Demon Abyss, sunlight appeared, making it seem like it was a beautiful spring day within the abyss. The sound of trickling water echoed through the air, filling the world with pleasant sounds and smells. The Primal God Pure Lands that Mo Eversnow created overlapped with Lin Ming’s grandmist space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith these two domains surrounding them, Lin Ming and Mo Eversnow slowly and carefully advanced forwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey didn’t use brute force to break through the dao domain, but instead used similar energies to assimilate themselves into the dao domain and unravel the profound principles within it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming walked forwards a step at a time.

Even though the absolute death energy in this dao domain could instantly crush a top grade saint artifact to dust, within this dual domain, although it still rippled out like waves and the strength inherent within it was still great, it was now extremely soft and gentle without any lethality at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTwo hours later, Lin Ming and Mo Eversnow finally made their way out of this dao domain.

It was unknown how long Lin Ming and Mo Eversnow walked for, but eventually the floor beneath their feet began to become slimy.

There are some divine medicines that can help prolong life, but to these peerless powerhouses who had dug out all the potential in their lives to the extreme, they are basically useless.
