{"id":44736,"no":70,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 3rd October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your note written in your own hand--and a pretty wobbly hand!--\n\u003cbr\u003e came this morning. I am so sorry that you have been ill; I wouldn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e have bothered you with my affairs if I had known. Yes, I will tell you\n\u003cbr\u003e the trouble, but it\u0027s sort of complicated to write, and VERY PRIVATE. \n\u003cbr\u003e Please don\u0027t keep this letter, but burn it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before I begin--here\u0027s a cheque for one thousand dollars. \n\u003cbr\u003e It seems funny, doesn\u0027t it, for me to be sending a cheque to you? \n\u003cbr\u003e Where do you think I got it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve sold my story, Daddy. It\u0027s going to be published serially\n\u003cbr\u003e in seven parts, and then in a book! You might think I\u0027d be wild\n\u003cbr\u003e with joy, but I\u0027m not. I\u0027m entirely apathetic. Of course I\u0027m glad\n\u003cbr\u003e to begin paying you--I owe you over two thousand more. It\u0027s coming\n\u003cbr\u003e in instalments. Now don\u0027t be horrid, please, about taking it,\n\u003cbr\u003e because it makes me happy to return it. I owe you a great deal\n\u003cbr\u003e more than the mere money, and the rest I will continue to pay all\n\u003cbr\u003e my life in gratitude and affection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your most\n\u003cbr\u003e worldly advice, whether you think I\u0027ll like it or not.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You know that I\u0027ve always had a very special feeling towards you;\n\u003cbr\u003e you sort of represented my whole family; but you won\u0027t mind, will you,\n\u003cbr\u003e if I tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for\n\u003cbr\u003e another man? You can probably guess without much trouble who he is. \n\u003cbr\u003e I suspect that my letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a\n\u003cbr\u003e very long time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I wish I could make you understand what he is like and how entirely\n\u003cbr\u003e companionable we are. We think the same about everything--\n\u003cbr\u003e I am afraid I have a tendency to make over my ideas to match his! \n\u003cbr\u003e But he is almost always right; he ought to be, you know,\n\u003cbr\u003e for he has fourteen years\u0027 start of me. In other ways, though,\n\u003cbr\u003e he\u0027s just an overgrown boy, and he does need looking after--\n\u003cbr\u003e he hasn\u0027t any sense about wearing rubbers when it rains. He and I\n\u003cbr\u003e always think the same things are funny, and that is such a lot;\n\u003cbr\u003e it\u0027s dreadful when two people\u0027s senses of humour are antagonistic. \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s any bridging that gulf!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he is--Oh, well! He is just himself, and I miss him, and miss him,\n\u003cbr\u003e and miss him. The whole world seems empty and aching. I hate the\n\u003cbr\u003e moonlight because it\u0027s beautiful and he isn\u0027t here to see it with me. \n\u003cbr\u003e But maybe you\u0027ve loved somebody, too, and you know? If you have,\n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t need to explain; if you haven\u0027t, I can\u0027t explain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, that\u0027s the way I feel--and I\u0027ve refused to marry him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I didn\u0027t tell him why; I was just dumb and miserable. I couldn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e think of anything to say. And now he has gone away imagining\n\u003cbr\u003e that I want to marry Jimmie McBride--I don\u0027t in the least,\n\u003cbr\u003e I wouldn\u0027t think of marrying Jimmie; he isn\u0027t grown up enough. \n\u003cbr\u003e But Master Jervie and I got into a dreadful muddle of misunderstanding\n\u003cbr\u003e and we both hurt each other\u0027s feelings. The reason I sent him\n\u003cbr\u003e away was not because I didn\u0027t care for him, but because I cared\n\u003cbr\u003e for him so much. I was afraid he would regret it in the future--\n\u003cbr\u003e and I couldn\u0027t stand that! It didn\u0027t seem right for a person\n\u003cbr\u003e of my lack of antecedents to marry into any such family as his. \n\u003cbr\u003e I never told him about the orphan asylum, and I hated to explain\n\u003cbr\u003e that I didn\u0027t know who I was. I may be DREADFUL, you know. \n\u003cbr\u003e And his family are proud--and I\u0027m proud, too!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also, I felt sort of bound to you. After having been educated\n\u003cbr\u003e to be a writer, I must at least try to be one; it would scarcely\n\u003cbr\u003e be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it. \n\u003cbr\u003e But now that I am going to be able to pay back the money, I feel\n\u003cbr\u003e that I have partially discharged that debt--besides, I suppose I could\n\u003cbr\u003e keep on being a writer even if I did marry. The two professions\n\u003cbr\u003e are not necessarily exclusive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been thinking very hard about it. Of course he is a Socialist,\n\u003cbr\u003e and he has unconventional ideas; maybe he wouldn\u0027t mind marrying into\n\u003cbr\u003e the proletariat so much as some men might. Perhaps when two people are\n\u003cbr\u003e exactly in accord, and always happy when together and lonely when apart,\n\u003cbr\u003e they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them. \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course I WANT to believe that! But I\u0027d like to get your\n\u003cbr\u003e unemotional opinion. You probably belong to a Family also, and will\n\u003cbr\u003e look at it from a worldly point of view and not just a sympathetic,\n\u003cbr\u003e human point of view--so you see how brave I am to lay it before you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isn\u0027t Jimmie,\n\u003cbr\u003e but is the John Grier Home--would that be a dreadful thing for me\n\u003cbr\u003e to do? It would take a great deal of courage. I\u0027d almost rather\n\u003cbr\u003e be miserable for the rest of my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This happened nearly two months ago; I haven\u0027t heard a word from him\n\u003cbr\u003e since he was here. I was just getting sort of acclimated to the\n\u003cbr\u003e feeling of a broken heart, when a letter came from Julia that stirred\n\u003cbr\u003e me all up again. She said--very casually--that `Uncle Jervis\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e had been caught out all night in a storm when he was hunting in Canada,\n\u003cbr\u003e and had been ill ever since with pneumonia. And I never knew it. \n\u003cbr\u003e I was feeling hurt because he had just disappeared into blankness\n\u003cbr\u003e without a word. I think he\u0027s pretty unhappy, and I know I am!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What seems to you the right thing for me to do?\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59792.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
