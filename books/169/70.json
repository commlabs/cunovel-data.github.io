He did not like what he saw. His mustache was gone; his sideburns were shortened; his hair was clipped at the sides and back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He looked-plucked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Worse than that. As a result of the change in his facial contours, he looked baby-faced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It was disgusting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Nor was he making any headway. Seldon had given him the security reports on Kaspal Kaspalov\u0027s death, which he had studied. There wasn\u0027t much there. Just that Kaspalov had been murdered and that the local security officers had come up with nothing of importance in connection with that murder. It seemed quite clear that the security officers attached little or no importance to it, anyway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; That was not surprising. In the last century, the crime rate had risen markedly in most worlds, certainly in the grandly complex world of Trantor, and nowhere were the local security officers up to the job of doing anything useful about it. In fact, the security establishment had declined in numbers and efficiency everywhere and (while this was hard to prove) had become more corrupt. It was inevitable this should be so, with pay refusing to keep pace with the cost of living. One must pay civil officials to keep them honest. Failing that, they would surely make up for their inadequate salaries in other ways.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon had been preaching this doctrine for some years now, but it did no good. There was no way to increase wages without increasing taxes and the populace would not sit still for increased taxes. It seemed they would rather lose ten times the credits in graft.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It was all part (Seldon had said) of the general deterioration of Imperial society over the previous two centuries.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Well, what was Raych to do? He was here at the hotel where Kaspalov had lived during the days immediately before his murder. Somewhere in the hotel there might be someone who had something to do with that-or who knew someone who had.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It seemed to Raych that he must make himself conspicuous. He must show an interest in Kaspalov\u0027s death and then someone would get interested in him and pick him up. It was dangerous, but if he could make himself sound harmless enough, they might not attack him immediately.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Well-\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Raych looked at his timeband. There would be people enjoying their predinner aperitifs in the bar. He might as well join them and see what would happen-if anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46651.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:43:26 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:43:26 AM"}
