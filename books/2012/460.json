Reached for Heboric’s .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the mortal stepped back, and said , ‘ Not yet, and not both of them. Both of them will kill you. I will reach for you, Lord, when the moment arrives. This I promise .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crippled God bowed, and stepped back .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with his Otataral hand, Heboric, once named Light-Touch, reached through the waters above him. Copper light burst forth, filled the entire cavern .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast fingers that erupted from the barrow encompassed the entire mound – but they did not tear the ground. Ghostly, translucent, they arced high overhead, and closed about the Otataral Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorabas loosed a deafening scream – but if it was a cry of pain, torment or release Fiddler could not tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the Otataral Dragon, which was even now being drawn closer down above them, the manifestation of T’iam – growing ever more corporeal, forming a multi-headed leviathan – began to tear itself apart once more. Distant shrieks, as dragons pulled away, lunged free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost fled as if their tails were on fire. Fiddler stared, now unmindful of the vast, descending form of the Otataral Dragon, as they raced away, while others, too badly damaged, spun earthward, striking the ground with thunderous concussions. It’s fucking raining dragons .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben stared upward, praying under his breath, and then his eyes narrowed – he could see through Korabas. He has her – whoever you are, you have her now .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods, this is going to work .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promised, Burn. I promised you, didn’t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, so maybe I can’t take all the credit .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor modesty’s sake, if I ever talk about it, I mean. But here, in my head … I did it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalam saw the infernal pride burgeoning in the wizard’s face and knew precisely what the scrawny bastard was thinking. The assassin wanted to hit the man. At least ten times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouched, even as the ghostly body of the Otataral Dragon slipped down around them all, Kalam turned to look at the Crippled God. Who stood motionless, eyes shut, hands still raised into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe a dragon can fly you up there, friend. They’re not all fleeing, are they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman he’d never seen before slumped down beside him, offered him an inviting smile. ‘I like the look of you,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods, not another one . ‘Who in Hood’s name are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile flashed wider. ‘I am the woman who stole the moon. Oh, I see that you don’t believe me, do you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s not that,’ he replied. ‘Fine, you stole it – but then you broke the fucking thing!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury lit her face most becomingly. ‘I am Apsal’ara, the Mistress of Thieves!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her. ‘Never liked thieves.’ Frustrate them. Works every time .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing the exchange, Quick Ben snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalam, you never learn, do you? Or maybe you just can’t help yourself .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roof of the cavern suddenly glowed white-hot, and Heboric spun to the Crippled God. ‘Now! Open your eyes – you can’t be down here when she arrives. No one can!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crippled God turned. He sensed the two Elder Gods were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarewell, Mael of the Seas and K’rul Maker of Warrens .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Open your eyes!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he did, and in that moment he felt Heboric take his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoryk had dragged himself behind a tilted standing stone, his eyes fixed upon the Crippled God not five paces away. There was a need inside him, unbearable, savage. It wanted to devour him. It wanted to annihilate the world, the one he lived in, the one that had nothing but the thinnest skin between what hid inside and what lay outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer. None but the obvious one – the one he dared not look at. If he did, he would have to face his own story – not as some nostalgic bravado, but as the succession of hurts that he was not unique in carrying. And he would see all the scars – the ones he bore, the others he had made on those close to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the Crippled God, as if it could somehow save his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Fallen One opened his eyes – and stared directly into Koryk’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade fire lit a whirling pillar round the god, spinning ever faster, the glow brightening, the air howling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir gazes were locked together through the emerald flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Koryk saw something – there, awakening, a look … a promise .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his soul reaching forth – closer … closer – reaching to touch. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-460.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
