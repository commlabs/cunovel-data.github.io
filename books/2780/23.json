Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my bedroom door behind me and collapse onto the bed. I can probably count the friends I have left on one hand. Actually, I can count them on one finger. I lay there for a while longer, wondering how I could have been so blind to his selfishness. I hear Reece walk to the spare bedroom, then the bathroom, packing up his things. I don\u0027t come back out of the bedroom until I\u0027m positive they\u0027re both gone. When I hear his car pull away, I walk to the kitchen and pour myself a cup of coffee. I guess I’ll have to start making my own coffee again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a very good start to the day.

That’s a promise. I’m not letting you go again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin walks through the front door right around seven o\u0027clock. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s walked in without knocking. It must be contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can tell I\u0027m a nervous wreck as soon as he sees me. \"They just left. We should let them get a head start,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea,\" I say. I make another walk-through of the house, trying to find something to add to the satchel. I\u0027m pretty sure I have it all. When we finally leave, I warn Gavin I\u0027m not going to be much for conversation on the ride there. Luckily, he understands. He always understands. That\u0027s what best friends do, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the drive, I recite everything I need to say over and over in my head. I\u0027ve got the poem down. I already talked to the guys at Club N9NE…so everything is in place there. Unfortunately, I only get one shot with her…so I\u0027ve got to make it count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we arrive, Gavin goes inside first. He texts me a minute later and ensures me the plan is in place. I walk inside with my satchel across my shoulder and wait on my cue from the entryway. I don’t want her to see me. If she sees me before it’s time, she’ll get angry and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seconds turn into minutes, and the minutes turn into eternity. I hate this. I’ve never been so nervous about performing before. I guess because when I normally perform, there’s nothing on the line. This performance tonight could very well determine my path in life. I take a deep breath and focus on my nerves when the emcee takes the microphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got something special planned for open mic tonight. So without further ado…” he walks off the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it. Now or never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the audience has their eyes glued to the stage so I go unnoticed as I walk along the wall to the right of the room and make my way to the front. Right before I walk onto the stage, I glance to the booth where they’re all sitting. Lake is right in the middle with nowhere to go. She’s looking down at her phone. She has no clue what’s about to hit her. I’ve already prepared myself for her reaction…she’s going to be pissed. I just need her to hear me out long enough to get through to her. She’s hard headed, but she’s also reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spotlight dims and focuses on a stool on the stage, just as I had instructed the lighting tech to do. I don’t like the bright lights hindering my view of the audience, so I made sure they would all be turned off. I want to see Lake’s face the entire time. I need to be able to look her in the eyes, so she’ll know just how serious I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I take the stairs, I stretch my neck and arms out to ease the apprehension building up inside of me. I exhale a few breaths, then take the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the stool and take a seat as I place my satchel on the floor. I take the microphone out of the stand and look straight at Lake, who finally looks up from her phone. As soon as she sees me, she frowns and shakes her head. She’s pissed. She says something to Caulder, who’s seated at the edge of the booth, and she points to the door. He shakes his head and doesn’t move. I watch as she fidgets her hands around beside her, looking for her purse. She can’t find it. She points to Kiersten who is seated on the other edge of the booth and Kiersten shakes her head, too. Lake looks at Gavin and Eddie, then at Kiersten again, then she realizes they’re all in on it. After accepting the fact that they aren’t going to let her out of the booth, she folds her arms across her chest and returns her focus back to the stage. Back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you finished trying to run away yet?” I say into the microphone. “Because I have a few things I’d like to say to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience turns and searches for the person I’m speaking to. When Lake notices everyone staring at her, she buries her face in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring the audience\u0027s attention back to me. “I’m breaking the rules tonight,” I say. “I know that slams can’t involve props, but I’ve got a few I need to use. It’s an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bend down and pick the satchel up, then stand up and place it on the stool. I put the microphone back into the stand and position it at the right height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lake? I know you told me you wanted me to think about everything you said the other night. I know it’s only been two days, but honestly, I didn’t even need two seconds. So instead of spending the last two days thinking about something I already know the answer to, I decided to do this instead. It’s not a traditional slam, but I have a feeling you aren\u0027t that picky. My piece tonight is called “Because of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhale and smile at her before I begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA first glance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA first smile\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA first kiss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA first fall…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I remove the Darth Vader house shoes from my satchel and look down at them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wearing these during one of those moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the moments I first started to fall in love with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way you gave me butterflies that morning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad absolutely nothing to do with anyone else,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand everything to do with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was falling in love with you that morning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I take the next item out of the satchel.
