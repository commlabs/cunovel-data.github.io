Your cousin is going away for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there\u0027s a warrant, that means he\u0027s not in jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He ran before the police got there. He hasn\u0027t been found yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all my fault,\" she whispered, her voice shaking with emotion. \"That man is in the hospital because of me. Will could have killed him. If I hadn\u0027t pleaded for probation, this wouldn\u0027t have happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it would have,\" he said. \"It just wouldn\u0027t have happened this soon. Your cousin isn\u0027t going to change. He\u0027s got a lot of rage inside. He should be locked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her head down and covered her face with her hands. \"I\u0027m responsible. Why didn\u0027t I think he was capable of such violence? Why didn\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam wouldn\u0027t let her continue to berate herself. \"You thought you were giving him one last chance to change his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a fool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you were naive. There\u0027s enough blame to go around. Phillips or I could have refused to get probation for him. But what\u0027s done is done. He\u0027s going to try to get you to help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t know I helped him get probation, does he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why would he come to me for help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027ve always helped his family in the past. Hell, you supported all of them. Your cousin has been running with some bad people. One of them might show up at your door. If Will or one of his friends tries to contact you, I want you to call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you\u0027re out of the country?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t going to let up until she agreed. \"Yes, I\u0027ll call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me your cell phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled it from her back pocket and watched as he programmed his number in and added it to speed dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then,\" he answered with finality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison waited for him to say something else, but Liam stood in front of her, silent and unmoving. The only sound was the chirping of crickets in the darkness. The longer he stood there, the more uncomfortable she became. Just being alone with him was enough to make her heart beat faster, but the way he was looking at her now almost brought her heart to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke the silence. \"Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer was brusque. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we should go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam took her hands to pull her to her feet, but when she was standing bare inches away, the willpower he had been relying on all evening evaporated into thin air. From the moment she walked through the door, he\u0027d wanted her. For the past two months, he had looked for every excuse to return to Boston. He had told himself the memory of their time together would fade, but that hadn\u0027t happened. And then, when he saw her again tonight, he knew he was in real trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allison . . . ,\" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to continue, but he only held her hands more tightly. His eyes searched hers as though he was seeking something intangible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to let go of me anytime soon?\" she whispered, hoping he couldn\u0027t feel her trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peeked around him to see if anyone was watching. The light from inside poured through the French doors. Thankfully, the dining room was empty. She wasn\u0027t worried about Alec and Noah noticing. They wouldn\u0027t say anything, but Jordan was another story. She\u0027d have at least a hundred questions, and Allison knew she wouldn\u0027t be able to answer a single one. How could she, when she didn\u0027t know what was happening herself? The only thing she was sure of was that she had been miserable for months, and Liam was the cause. To avoid a future of misery, she had to keep her distance from him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe freed her hands and said, \"You should leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You\u0027re right. I should leave you alone.\" He stepped even closer so that she had to tilt her head up to look at him. She could feel the warmth of his chest against hers and wondered if he could hear the breath that caught in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his head, and as though she had no control over her reactions, her fingers slid into his soft hair. \"This is all wrong. I can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s definitely all wrong,\" he said as his mouth brushed over hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he kissed her exactly how she wanted him to, and oh, how he made her want more. She heard a low groan, then realized she was the one making the sound. He overwhelmed her, and when he finally ended the kiss her arms were clasped around his neck. She was slow to get her wits back. When she finally found her strength, she pushed against him. Unfortunately, he didn\u0027t budge. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-76.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
