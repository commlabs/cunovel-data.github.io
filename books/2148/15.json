Not only did everyone in town decorate their houses with festive, twinkling lights and their yards with snowmen, penguins, and reindeer, but it meant two weeks of vacation. Free time to do whatever I wanted. And Ivy, Abby, and I had sleepovers, all-night gabfests, and endless laughs. I could sleep in as long as I\u0027d like to and be my own boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this year, winter break was torture. It meant two torturous weeks without seeing the guy who had stolen my heart. Practically every moment was spent thinking about him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;him saving me, the first time I held his wounded hand in mine, the kiss of a lifetime. And when I wasn\u0027t dreaming about him, I was worrying about him and the strange condition I found him in underneath the full moon. Instead of relishing my days of freedom, I longed for the ringing of first bell and the start of English class. But winter break crept along without him, monotonously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to wonder if what I saw that night was real and agonized over how I\u0027d handled the situation. If I had to give advice to the lovelorn about what to say when seeing a guy again after sharing a spectacular kiss and hoping for another date, it would be to say one of these three things: \"Had a blast,\" \"Hope we can hang out again,\" or \"Here\u0027s my number.\" The one thing I\u0027d never advise saying would be, \"It looked like you turned into a werewolf!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I expect Brandon ever to call, text, or contact me when I\u0027d told him that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so confused about my feelings toward Brandon. Maybe it was time to turn back and not continue down this uncharted road I\u0027d been traveling on. When Nash returned from vacation with his parents, it would be my chance to reconcile with him, put all this Westsider fascination to rest, and move on in the direction my life had already been taking. But I cared for Brandon so deeply, it just wasn\u0027t something I had control over. And I assumed Brandon was mixed up as well. He was the one going through something\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;strange dreams, not remembering the nights, and missing school. If I contacted him, I\u0027d only be adding to his already suddenly complicated life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving Juliette home during the break only added to my angst. She was in and out of our front door with different guys, laughing and giggling and staying out until the wee hours. All I wanted to do was see one guy, be near him, touch him, and kiss him. My skin hurt without Brandon\u0027s touch, my mind raced with thoughts of him. I realized there was only one person I could turn to in my time of need, who knew more about love, romance, and hot guys than anyone I\u0027d known\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;someone who might have the answers for my obsessive romantic feelings and how to cure them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on my sister\u0027s bedroom door. When she didn\u0027t respond, I opened it to find her putting the final touches on her makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you knock? I could have been undressed,\" she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I did knock, and you aren\u0027t undressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I could have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliette was so pretty she didn\u0027t need to wear makeup. But still she spent endless hours in front of the mirror painting her face with whatever colors were in that particular season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliette\u0027s room was in stark contrast to my own. Mine was filled with books, DVDs, and trinkets. Where other teens had band or movie posters hanging on their walls, my sister had framed pictures of herself with her friends and various boyfriends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jules, I need to ask you something,\" I said, sitting on her bed. \"How do you know if you are in love?\" I asked, fiddling with the frame on her nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. I didn\u0027t want a vague answer that I could get from anyone. I wanted someone to speak to me about specifics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, are you in love with Nash?\" she asked. \"He is really hot.\" Juliette turned away from her mirror and toward me. \"Is he trying to pressure you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash always wanted more from our relationship than I was prepared to give. But that wasn\u0027t it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s not that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because if he is, I know some guys in my dorm who will make him wish he hadn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you do anything you\u0027re not ready to do. You understand? That is the most important thing. Only when you are ready and only when you\u0027re much older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was lecturing me. But I didn\u0027t mind. Almost. It was sweet that she cared about my well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows where he stands with me,\" I said. \"Anyway, I\u0027m talking about love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Nash know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. Besides, we aren\u0027t seeing each other right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. What did he do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no biggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Then let\u0027s talk about the new guy! Have you gone out on a date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, it\u0027s a crush from afar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well.... not really...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is it?\" she asked impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met him at his house. We went ice-skating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d call that a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Did he kiss you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve kissed him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I didn\u0027t answer, she put down her makeup and hopped on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kissed him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accidentally,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t mean for it to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the best kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean I was waiting, like forever. But then it just happened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it!\" My sister high-fived me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t rein in my smile if I\u0027d had Botox. I hadn\u0027t told anyone, so it was good to finally girl-talk with someone. Even if it was my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too embarrassed to talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon! Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was heaven. Amazing. Like nothing I\u0027ve ever felt in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squealed with delight. Suddenly we were reduced to two giggling girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who is this dreamy guy who\u0027s stolen my little sister\u0027s heart?\" she asked. \"I want names and dates. What does he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe!\" she ordered, pointing her mascara brush at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brown wavy hair, royal blue eyes. His lips are full and dreamy. His stare can penetrate your soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow! Can you introduce him to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in high school!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have a brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have a name?\" My sister was getting frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not giving you names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, you wouldn\u0027t know him. Besides, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s love or the flu,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are your symptoms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Symptoms!\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I can\u0027t eat. I can\u0027t sleep. I can\u0027t focus on school or even the most menial tasks. And I\u0027m obsessed with thinking about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s love. Or at the very least lust. Something I prefer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Do you think these feelings could distort my view of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Physically. Like the way he looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Some girls fall for the lamest guys but think they\u0027re studs \u0027cause they are clouded by love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But like... could these feelings make him look more muscular? Grow a goatee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys can get stubble by the end of the day. That\u0027s normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean instantly, I wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And make his hair appear longer and his eyes change color?\" I asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you mean going from blue eyes to twinkling liquid blue eyes, then yes, that can be because you\u0027re love-struck. But if you\u0027re talking about blue eyes changing to brown, then no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy smile turned into a frown. I grew worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you getting at?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love can distort your view of him,\" she said, patting my leg. She obviously didn\u0027t know that I was alluding to him becoming a lycan, but I appreciated my sister\u0027s reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you first fall in love?\" I asked. \"Was it with Brad or Jason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" she asked with a laugh. \"No,\" she said as if I must have already known. \"I\u0027ve never been in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was floored. My sister had had a guy on her arm since kindergarten. How could she not have fallen in love by now? I felt sad that I may have actually experienced the feelings of true love before she had. With all the guys she dated, not one had penetrated her materialistic heart? Of course, we were still young and she had her whole life ahead of her, but I\u0027d figured she\u0027d been in love countless times. That just reinforced for me that I couldn\u0027t ignore the feelings that I had for Brandon\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that they were as real as the shirt I had sitting on my nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we finished with our chat?\" she asked, packing up her makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost. I\u0027m doing a research paper on folklore. It\u0027s about werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would pick the creepy stuff. Why didn\u0027t you pick fairies? I still have my paper somewhere. You could have used mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know there\u0027s a legend here about werewolves?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027ve heard,\" she said, as if I thought she was an alien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think the legend is true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I think there really are werewolves lurking in the woods of Legend\u0027s Run, showing their scruffy faces under the full moon? Attacking animals and carrying off women, never to return? It does sound romantic in a weird way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does,\" I said, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We always imagine what we can\u0027t understand. Like love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But love can be real. So does that mean werewolves can be, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure people see things in the dark and then just put a face on it,\" she surmised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not answering my question,\" I said impatiently. \"Do you believe in werewolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that simple. My sister didn\u0027t believe in werewolves. And even though I thought I might have seen one, I didn\u0027t believe in them either. At the end of the day, we had that much in common. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-15.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
