I lifted her up in the air a little, the way I used to do with my mom. “Thanks, Laure,” I said. “Really, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d do anything for you boys. You know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you know to come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Belly called me,” she said. She narrowed her eyes at me. “Drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. “Laure—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you ‘Laure’ me. How could you let her drink? I count on you, Jeremiah. You know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I felt awful too. The last thing I wanted was for Belly to get in trouble, and I really hated the thought of Laurel thinking badly of me. I’d always tried so hard to look out for Belly, unlike Conrad. If anyone had corrupted her, it was Conrad, not me. Even though I was the one who bought the tequila, not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I’m really sorry. It’s just that with my dad’s selling the house, and it being our last night, we got carried away. I swear, Laure, it’ll never happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. “‘It’ll never happen again’? Don’t make promises you can’t keep, hon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’ll never happen again on my watch,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePursing her lips, she said, “We’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was relieved when she gave me another grimace-smile. “Hurry up and get to the store, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye aye, sir.” I wanted her to smile for real. I knew that if I kept trying, kept joking, she would. She was easy that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, she really did smile back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty-six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother was right. The shower helped. I tilted my face toward the shower head and let the hot water wash over me and I felt much, much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my shower, I came back downstairs a new woman. My mother was wearing lipstick, and she and Conrad were talking in low voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped talking when they saw me standing in the doorway. “Much better,” my mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Jeremiah?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeremiah went back to the store. He forgot the grapefruit,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timer went off and my mother took muffins out of the oven with a dish towel. She accidentally touched the muffin tin with her bare hand and she yelped and dropped the tin on the floor, muffin side down. “Damn!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad asked if she was okay before I could. “I’m fine,” she said, running cold water over her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she picked the tin back up and set it on the counter, on top of the towel. I sat down on one of the counter stools and watched my mother empty the muffin tin into a basket. “Our little secret,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muffins were supposed to cool a little while before you took them out of the tin, but I didn’t tell her that. A few were smushed but they mostly looked okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have a muffin,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took one, and it was burning hot and falling apart, but it was good. I ate it quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was done, my mother said, “You and Conrad take the recycling out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Conrad picked up two of the heavier bags and left me the half-empty one. I followed him outside to the trashcans at the end of the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you call her?” he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess I did.” I waited for him to call me a baby for calling my mommy the second things got scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t. Instead, he said, “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. “Sometimes you surprise me,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t look at me when he said, “And you hardly ever surprise me. You’re still the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him. “Thanks a lot.” I dumped my garbage bag in the bin and shut the lid a little too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I mean . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for him to say something, and it seemed like he might have, but then Jeremiah’s car came down the street. We both watched Jeremiah park and then bound out of the car with a plastic grocery bag. He strode up to us, his eyes bright. “Hey,” he said to me, his bag swinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I said. I couldn’t even look him in the eye. It had all come back to me when I was in the shower. Making Jeremiah dance with me, running away from Conrad, and him picking me up and dropping me in the sand. How humiliating. How awful that they saw me behave that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jeremiah gave my hand a squeeze, and when I looked up at him, he said “thank you” so sweetly it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us walked back to the house. The Police were singing “Message in a Bottle” and the stereo was very loud. Right away my head started pounding and all I wanted was to go back to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we turn down that music?” I asked, rubbing my temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope,” my mother said, taking the bag from Jeremiah. She pulled out a big grapefruit and tossed it to Conrad. “Squeeze,” she said, pointing at the juicer. The juicer was Mr. Fisher’s, and it was huge and complicated, one of those Jack LaLanne ones from the late night infomercials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad snorted. “For him? I’m not squeezing his grapefruit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you will.” To me, my mother said, “Mr. Fisher’s coming to breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squealed. I ran over to her and wrapped my arms around her waist. “It’s just breakfast,” she warned me. “Don’t go getting your hopes up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. I knew she’d change his mind. I knew it. And so did Jeremiah and Conrad. They believed in my mother and so did I—never more so than when Conrad started cutting the grapefruit in half. My mother nodded at him like a drill sergeant. Then she said, “Jere, you set the table, and Belly, you do the eggs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started cracking eggs into a bowl, and my mother fried bacon in Susannah’s cast iron skillet. She left the bacon grease for me to fry the eggs in. I stirred the eggs around, and the smell of the eggs and the grease made me want to gag. I held my breath as I stirred, and my mother tried to hide a smile as she watched me. “Feeling okay, Belly?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, my teeth clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ever planning on drinking again?” she asked conversationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head as hard as I could. “Never, ever again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mr. Fisher arrived half an hour later, we were ready for him. He walked in and looked at the table in amazement. “Wow,” he said. “This looks great, Laure. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a meaningful look, the adult co-conspiratorial kind of look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother smiled a Mona Lisa kind of smile. Mr. Fisher wasn’t gonna know what hit him. “Let’s sit,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-41.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
