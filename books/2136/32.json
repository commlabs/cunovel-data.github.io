The island itself was sort of long and narrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean would be only a half mile or so on either side. Although not huge, the island was choked with evergreens and ferns and something called stinging nettles, which Tara had warned us about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could give a damn about stinging nettles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though it was only midday, the woods were dark. But here, under the canopy of evergreens, the storm was nearly non-existent, reduced to only a persistent, howling wind - and a few heavy drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe path before us was mostly dirt. I could see deer tracks in the mud, and what was surely a dog\u0027s tracks, although they could have been coyotes. I frowned at that. I didn\u0027t think coyotes were on the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison looked miserable and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buried her face in her oversized jacket. Myself, I was wearing only a light windbreaker. I was fairly certain my body temperature was even lower than the surrounding wind and rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI veered off on a smaller side-trail, and there we found a massive tree with the widest trunk I\u0027d ever seen. I stopped and turned to Allison, who\u0027d been following with her head mostly ducked, doing her best not to trip over the many exposed tree roots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We might be in some deep shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just talked to Kingsley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your ex-boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize that a vampire dating a werewolf is a little too...cliched?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allison...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, sorry...you were saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some scary shit going on here. Kingsley\u0027s coming out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks I\u0027m in way over my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam, from what you\u0027ve told me, you\u0027ve faced some crazy shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe none crazier than this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even crazier than me?\" asked Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. I needed that. The tree branches high above us swished and swayed violently. Never had I seen trees like this. So tall, so beautiful. Now as I stood there in the forest, I noticed little balls of light moving about. These bright balls stopped often at plants and at the bases of trees. I watched one stop near a toadstool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison caught my thoughts, and said, \"I see those lights, too, sometimes. At parks, and sometimes on my balcony garden at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I had to guess, I would say fairies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scoffs the vampire,\" said Allison, shaking her head. \"You, better than most, should know that there are some strange things under the sun...or under the moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But fairies?\" I asked. \"With little wings? Like Tinker Bell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of them as nature spirits, Sammie. And no little wings, as far as I can tell. Just peaceful, loving entities that tend to Mother Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the lights flit around the forest some more, dozens of them. Many dozens. They were often the same size, each no bigger than a tennis ball, and their colors ranged from light blue to burning white. One sidled up next to us, slipped between my legs and moved over to a dying fern. It moved carefully over the plant, touching down on each outstretched branch, and then moved on. I sensed, on some level, that it was comforting the dying plant. Weird, yes, but I found the gesture oddly touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what do we do, Sam?\" asked Allison after a moment or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t do anything. I need to find out what the hell is going on here. You\u0027re going to stay in the bungalow - and stay out of trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to protest when she saw the look in my eye. \"Fine, I\u0027ll stay out of trouble, but I want you to know that I\u0027m lodging a formal complaint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duly noted,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, then, what are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe asked, ducking as a particularly large glob of water splattered on her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have a little talk with our client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tara? But isn\u0027t she one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" I said, and turned and headed back through the forest, with Allison stumbling and cursing behind me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-32.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
