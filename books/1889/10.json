I feel like pulling my skin apart to free the white noise and the buzzing inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slump onto a bench with my head in my gloves. He sits next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Eli. Her journey doesn’t have to be ours. She can make it whatever she wants afterwards but you gotta detach. You\u0027ve been balls to the wall for two years on this shit. She has done nothing but prove she is a responsible girl. She\u0027s smart and resilient and strong. She\u0027s stronger than us. Remember us at this point? We were crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes won\u0027t open but I nod, \"I\u0027m going to the bar. I can\u0027t have her out and not see her. I need you outside with the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudges me, \"Stay out of her sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis look grows concerned, \"Do you love her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t lie to him so I don’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks beautiful. She is the most underdressed girl in the group of them, but she\u0027s beautiful all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are wide as they approach the line up. Michelle says something to her and her face flushes instantly. She looks like she might run, but instead, she pulls her pants down to her ass crack and hikes up her shirt to the bottom of her breasts, showing almost everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart\u0027s hand slaps across my chest, pinning me to the seat, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t take my eyes off of her, \"What the fuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"They won\u0027t get in the bar without her looking like meat, man. That bouncer ain’t gonna let some chick in jeans and a tee shirt stroll past the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath but it becomes a growl. A guy behind her is touching her, pushing himself against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart shakes his head, laughing, \"You have to breathe. She just needs to get in. Sarah ain\u0027t no fool. She ain\u0027t gonna let some random rub against her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disappears into the bar like she\u0027s in a conga line and buddy behind her is making me ready to murder someone, him mostly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb out and give Stuart a look, \"Be ready. She\u0027ll be here in fifteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and points with a cocky smile on his lips, \"She just pulled her pants to her ass crack to get in a bar. She\u0027s gonna be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam the door, strolling up to the bouncer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a look but the hundred dollars I place in his hands puts a smile on his lips, \"Well, come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and walk past him. The club is the same as all the others. A girl in a miniskirt tries to eye fuck me from the bar. I can count the seconds I\u0027ve got, before she ties the stem of the cherry she\u0027s sucking into a knot. She saunters over, sliding a hand up my chest, \"Hi there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smells of insecurities and booze. I pluck her hand from my chest, still scanning the room, \"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowls, \"Screw you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stops, my girl is dancing and throwing her hands in the air. Her clothes look normal again but her hair is down. I shake my head and mumble, \"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trashy blonde leaves in a huff. A brunette with huge, glossy lips walks up to me as I lean against the bar, hiding in the corner to watch only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brunette nudges me, \"You look grumpy. Want me to cheer you up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at her, trying not to think about those glossy lips and where I would like them wrapped. I shake my head, \"I like being grumpy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins wide and flutters her lashes a little, \"I like you grumpy too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn, waving at the bartender, \"Scotch, neat.\" I look back at the brunette and know she could make the noise stop. The sound of the buzzing inside of me almost craves her. She steps closer as my drink lands in front of me, and picks it up. She shoots the scotch back. My hand slips into my pants, pulling a card. I slip it into her hand before I really think about the choice I\u0027m making. She plucks it from my hand and saunters off again, wiggling her perky ass in her black skirt. My face is tight with want and need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wave at the bartender again. He places another scotch in front of me. I suck it back as fast as the brunette did and turn back around. My girl is dancing up a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops and leans against the rail around the dance floor. My body, still filled with whatever the brunette did to me, walks that way. I don’t have control. It\u0027s involuntary. I hate involuntary but she\u0027s like a tractor beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me nervously; it\u0027s the first time in a long time that our eyes have met. She swallows and somewhere inside of me the bad thoughts I was having die off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to dance?\" What the fuck am I doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\" She shakes her head, looking scared but there is something else in those eyes. She stares me down, \"Do I know you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around the bar, trying not to panic, \"I don’t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watches me and then it\u0027s as if a light bulb comes on. I can see the recognition, \"Are you him? Are you my guardian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is smart. Too smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to laugh and tell her who I am; she\u0027s too smart for me. Instead, I close it off, \"Him who? What?\" I roll my eyes, \"I just wanted to dance.\" I turn and leave quickly, leaving the bar. My hands are sweating. My stupidity and desire are all consuming. It doesn’t even make sense. I suit the girl with the luscious lips and the want to be punished. I suit the hard life I have; my girl is a delicate flower. She doesn’t deserve what I am, the bad thing they made me into. The thing I made myself become, to forget the things they convinced me weren’t true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross the road, walking past the truck, and head into the city. My lack of self-control with her is brutal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t even know how to get it back. She is running me without even knowing me. I dial Jane and cringe when she answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is your evening?\" Her patronizing tone makes me want to murder her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Great. She\u0027s going to be fine. That Sebastian you hired, he\u0027s perfect. They\u0027ve hit it off and now she\u0027s at a bar having fun and being reckless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me I was right, I won\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoff, \"Well, lets not get carried away. I don’t think you need me though. You don’t need me to play the part. She is honestly, fine. A little fear here and there, but beyond that, she\u0027s good.\" I don’t say that she doesn’t need me because I hate that. I need her so much. I hate that more. I need to be free of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eli, you know you\u0027re going to be fine even if she never knows who you are. You made it out of that hole too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Yeah, but Em didn’t.\" I end the call and pray the brunette calls me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t though, it\u0027s Stuart who phones next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have her. She freaked. We\u0027re driving.\" He hangs up quickly before she hears him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach sinks, and yet, my heart feels something resembling my twisted joy. She needs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to the dorms and sit outside her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is crushed but I\u0027m not. I still see her tear-stained face staring at me, needing me the way I need her. She makes me brave, she always did. I couldn’t carry her and Em so I had to choose. She just doesn’t know I chose her; I always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floor of the dorm is cool, compared to the muggy heat of the early fall. Boston is one of those places where the switch hits and suddenly it\u0027s freezing. The switch hasn’t hit yet though. My dress pants are itchy against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could stare into space for hours, I have so many times. I could get lost in the nothingness I surround myself with. But she stops it. My back pressed against the wall of the room she is in, makes me real and grounded and purposeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is the reason and doesn’t know it, doesn’t know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates, \u0027Michelle is coming!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get up and leave the dorm quickly. Stuart is sitting at the curb waiting. His eyes are dark, they get that way sometimes. I think my girl makes him sicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was bad,\" he says as he opens the back door. I walk past him to the passenger seat and nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs and closes the back door, \"You annoy me. You hire me to drive you and her around, and yet, you don’t act like I\u0027m your driver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a look, \"I want details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks but it\u0027s the dead-eyes smirk I hate, \"I need White Castle so lets get some food and talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was having a beer with Michelle and then that guy Dr. Bradley hired was there. I think she called his ass and told him what was going on, for real. Anyway, she flipped out, too much pressure, exposure, or whatever. She went dark, made me drive her around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a softened look. He sighs and drives towards White Castle, \"She and that guy are for sure gonna date, dude. She likes him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I know. I wish she knew who he is and why he\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart scoffs, \"He\u0027s there ‘cause she\u0027s hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a look, \"He\u0027s there because Jane asked him to be. I know she set this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart laughs, \"You have had a hate on for her since you banged her. I told you that was a bad idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate the wording ‘banged her’, but I have to give him that one. I banged the shit out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer needs match mine. Doctor Bradley is a sick woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI change the subject, \"Well, we wait it out, when she needs us we\u0027ll be there. This thing with this guy isn’t going to last. She doesn’t stand a chance at this normal she wants so badly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoston, December 1st\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips wrap tight around me. I have to stare at the wall across from me. If I close my eyes, I see my girl\u0027s face and it makes me want it to be more than getting my cock sucked in an alley. I want to see her lips and not the brunette on the floor in front of me. I grab the back of her head, thrusting into her mouth harder. A car drives past the alley, splashing water. I focus on the noise and my thrusts. I need it done. I don’t need perfection, just completion. I hear her gag but I\u0027m there. I push into her throat, making her eyes bug out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrows knit together as I blast the inside of her throat. I pull back a little, making her able to moan again and suck. The noise she is making is trying to distract my peaceful exhale. I bite my lip, feeling it leave me. I shudder and reach into my pants to drop the hundred-dollar bill in there onto the ground. I step away from her, doing my pants up and walk away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-10.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
