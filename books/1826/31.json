I know a guy who could get us tickets to anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn laughed. “You always know a guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan and Finn had been partners for only a short time, but they had already learned each other’s quirks. Ronan had been raised in Boston’s inner city in one of the toughest neighborhoods in the country. He had a rough edge to him and had been on the wrong side of the law more often than he wanted to admit. A full college scholarship had changed his life. That and the Marines. He and Finn made a good team, which was why they had been assigned to work together on several cases. Finn trusted his judgment and knew he’d have his back if things got dicey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any news from Dalton?” Ronan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn had told him all about the investigation. “I’m waiting to hear the ballistics report on the guns they took to the lab. I’m betting Albertson’s henchman, Parsons, used one of those rifles to take a shot at Peyton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why Parsons and not Albertson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Albertson’s at the top of the list, too, but Peyton is sure that it was Parsons who shot at her car in Minnesota. He’s got a record a mile long, and he wouldn’t hesitate to try again. I’d really like to get him in an interrogation room—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t do that. You’re too close to this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn disagreed. “I could get him to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He shot at the woman you love,” Ronan said. He was very matter-of-fact about it. “You’d go in there and punch his lights out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peyton’s a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, right. A friend.” Ronan laughed. “Just when I think you’ve got it all figured out, you say something dumb. Your brain must be waterlogged from all that swimming you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, now you’re an expert on my love life? Since when did you turn into a girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan wasn’t the least insulted. “You’re easy to read. You’ve been different ever since you connected with her. You’re—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Finn was impatient and ready to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Happier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hell I am.” Only after the words were out of his mouth did he realize how crazy and defensive he sounded. “Let’s talk about your love life. See how you like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s nothing to talk about. Collins doesn’t want a relationship. She told me it was for the best if we didn’t see each other again. We’re going down different roads, and it couldn’t possibly work out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t what he said but how he said it that told Finn there was more to the story. “You don’t seem too broken up about it. You sound kind of cheerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want her to be happy. If she wants to go it alone, that’s fine with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you? What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marry her,” Ronan said. When he saw the skepticism on his friend’s face, he reiterated, “Honest to God, I am gonna marry her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn had a good laugh. “You sound sure of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She loves me,” Ronan said with a shrug. “She’s just scared. She’ll come around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marriage is a big commitment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure is,” he agreed. “But when you’re ready, you’re ready. I think you’re scared, too, but you’ll come around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn shook his head. “Marriage isn’t for everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, Ronan switched back to the investigation in Dalton. He asked several questions about Albertson’s trip to see Peyton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more Finn talked about Albertson, the angrier he became. “I wish I could be there to see that bastard’s face when he gets the hammer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t you be there? The seminar’s over Wednesday evening. You could catch a flight to Minneapolis Thursday, spend the night, and rent a car Friday morning to drive to Dalton. When is the announcement supposed to happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hutton said it’s scheduled for one in the afternoon. He could get me in without Albertson seeing me. I wouldn’t want to ruin his surprise or make him suspicious.” He mulled over the idea for a second and said, “I don’t know. Maybe I will go. I’ll think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn couldn’t stay away; he had to go. He knew Peyton was worried about the announcement, but he was more concerned about what Albertson would do after he was thrown out of the company. Finn had talked to him and looked him in the eye when he’d shown up in Bishop’s Cove and made his veiled threats. He already knew what Albertson was capable of. There were hints of a violent temper in his background. Finn expected him to be enraged and want revenge. The question was, how long would he hold on to his desire to get even before moving on? Randolph Swift was about to snatch millions of dollars out of his grasp and humiliate him in the process. Randolph was probably going to disown his daughter as well. Oh yes, Albertson would want to get even. Agents Hutton and Lane believed he would go after Randolph and perhaps even Erik, but Finn was convinced his primary target would be Peyton. She had been the one to start the stone rolling down the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t difficult to make the arrangements. Since Finn’s superior was also attending the seminar, it was easy to get his approval without e-mails and paperwork. Finn scheduled his flights in and out of Minneapolis and arranged to pick up a car at the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of everything but the weather. It was sleeting when he drove out of the rental lot. His lightweight raincoat wasn’t much protection from the cold. He hated bulky clothes. He wore a suit, but once the heater kicked on, he was able to take off the jacket, loosen his tie, and get comfortable. As he drove north, Peyton kept popping into his thoughts. He pictured her making the drive from Dalton in a blizzard. A couple of months had passed and spring had officially arrived, but there was still snow on the ground and more on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutton called him just as he was taking the Dalton exit. He gave him directions to Swift’s main office and said, “You can’t miss it. It’s a giant phallic symbol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn thought he was joking until he spotted the building. Damn, it was ugly. Whoever designed it should get some serious help, Finn thought. He parked in the visitors’ lot and met Hutton at a side door. Although he’d talked to him many times on the phone, Finn had never actually met him in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Hutton was in his early forties. He had a firm handshake and a wry sense of humor. After he shook Finn’s hand, he said, “Was I right about the building? It looks like a phallic symbol, doesn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on inside. We’ll go up the back way to the auditorium. There’s an empty office by the elevators. Erik Swift said we could wait in there. Lane is keeping his eyes on Albertson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is Albertson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In his office preparing his speech.” He smiled as he added, “Is he gonna be pissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s an auditorium here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, with a big stage. It’s outfitted with kitchen appliances and a big island in front. They film a couple of cooking shows for a cable network. Everyone will come in and sit. Oh, and you’re gonna love this—Albertson is insisting on filming the announcement. He personally made sure the cameras were ready to roll.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do love it,” he admitted. “Albertson’s personal assistant—her name is Mimi. He’ll know she’s been helping Peyton. You need to get her out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Already done. Albertson thinks she’s taking a late lunch. She won’t be back. She and a man named Lars left together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they continued up the stairs, Finn asked, “How are you and Lane explaining your presence here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were here a few weeks ago asking questions about anyone who might have followed Peyton Lockhart when she left Dalton. We didn’t get anywhere with that, of course. Albertson and Parsons both had alibis. Ever since you reported the second incident in Florida, we’ve been keeping pretty close tabs on them. As you know, we haven’t been able to make a connection with him or Parsons to the shooting . . . yet,” he said. He opened the door to a small office and flipped on the lights. “Albertson thinks we stopped by today to finish up our report, and Erik Swift is backing us up. Albertson’s so caught up in his excitement at becoming the head honcho around here, he’s oblivious. Hell, J. Edgar Hoover himself could come back from the dead and shake his hand today and he wouldn’t notice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of minutes later, he led Finn into the auditorium. It was built like a theater with a long, wide stage and upholstered chairs that were arranged in a half circle and tiered so that those seated at the top had just as clear a view as those sitting in the front. It was a slick setup, he thought. The stage sparkled with stainless steel and marble. An employee was busy placing folding chairs on either side of the podium, which stood in the center. Another employee was running a microphone and testing the sound. Showtime was in twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Albertson and the others will go up to the stage from the side entrances,” Hutton said. “I’ve found a good spot for you to watch.” He pointed to the back corner. “Over there by the pillars. The lighting will be focused on the stage. If you stand on the other side of the pillar, no one will see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn took his place in the shadows, and the auditorium started to fill up with people. Some walking in by themselves, others entering in small groups. In less than ten minutes, the room was full and buzzing with chatter over the upcoming announcement. Finn could hear a conversation between two women seated in the back row. The topic was the change they had noticed in Randolph Swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s got a bounce in his step lately. Haven’t you noticed? We didn’t see him for so long, and now he’s coming back in the office again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think he’s met someone? He seems more alive these days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He looked like death after sweet Miriam died. She really was a dear woman, wasn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, she was. Do you know she never forgot any employee’s name? She even remembered my Sarah’s name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought Randolph wanted to get in the grave with her, he was so devastated. But now it appears he’s back with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad of it. I wish he weren’t going to retire. It’s going to be awful with Drew Albertson in charge. You’ve seen how he treats women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially young women,” her friend added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He and Eileen try to stop the rumors, but I think they’re true. With him as boss, I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to work here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights framing the stage suddenly brightened, and the employees immediately stopped talking and sat up straighter in anticipation. The side doors opened, and Erik, his expression solemn, took a seat on the right side of the podium. At the same time Drew and his wife, Eileen, stepped out into the lights. They stood together smiling at the audience before making their way to the stage. Drew, acting like a politician up for reelection, waved to the crowd while Eileen smiled and nodded to several people in the front row. They took seats to the left of the podium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cheer went up and everyone stood when Randolph Swift came onstage. He was tall and very thin. He had wide shoulders like his daughter and a firm jaw like his son. The lines in his face told the story of a life that had experienced a great deal, but there was a vitality in his step, just as the two women had said. He seemed touched by the ovation and raised his hand to acknowledge the affection. When the cheering and applause did not die down, he raised both hands and motioned for them to take their seats. Finally the noise subsided enough for him to be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thanked everyone for the kind reception, and then said, “I have several announcements today.” He pulled note cards from the inside pocket of his suit and placed them on the podium. “I’d like to begin by saying that it was wrong of me to demand that you attend Miriam’s memorial. She’d have a fit if she knew I was doing that. She didn’t want me to mourn, either,” he said. “I’m still going to have the memorial, but you don’t have to attend. If you have other plans, that’s all right. She and I both know you loved her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother round of applause erupted, and he waited to speak again. “The memorial isn’t going to have speeches. It will be a party with food and drink and balloons for the kids. We’re going to celebrate her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again the crowd showed its approval by clapping. Randolph straightened to his full height, then glanced at Drew and Eileen. They were both smiling at the audience as though the adulation was for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now on to the other changes I’d like to share with you. After much deliberation, I’ve decided to step down as head of this company. I know this doesn’t come as a surprise to most of you.” He added with a nod, “It’s time. And I’m confident I’m leaving you in good hands. Let me tell you about your new CEO. You’re getting a powerhouse. I believe he’s much smarter than I am, much more creative, and much more innovative. He won’t be afraid to try new ideas, so I have no concern that the company will become stale. He has wonderful plans for expansion and, most important, he truly understands how valuable all of you are to the company. His moral compass is straight and true, and it will guide him in making good decisions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused to glance over his shoulder at Albertson, who was posing with the most sincere look of humility he could muster. Randolph turned back to the upturned faces in the auditorium and continued. “I would now like to introduce to you the new CEO of Swift Publications . . . Erik Swift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room vibrated as the crowd jumped to their feet in unison and began to cheer wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn watched Drew. He didn’t move a muscle, and Finn thought he didn’t quite grasp what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEileen understood. Her face twisted in rage, and she nearly overturned her chair as she sprang forward and shouted, “That’s not right. You’ve got it wrong. Drew is the new CEO.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer panic was explosive. Randolph ignored her, and that only fueled her anger. Turning to the audience, she screamed, “Stop it. Stop cheering. Shut up and sit down.” She roared the last demand, then turned to her father and said, “Is this a joke? Drew’s the CEO. You’re having fun, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew grabbed Eileen’s arm and jerked her back to her seat. His expression was stony now, but even from the distance separating them, Finn could see the fire in his eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hotshot-buchanan-renard-11/page-31.html","bookId":1826,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:40 PM"}
