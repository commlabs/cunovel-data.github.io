Then again, maybe the chest is still here because someone wanted it left alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy in the vision?\" Jonas suggested softly. \"Digby came to the conclusion that the treasure, whatever it was, might be protected with a curse. It was one of the last entries in his diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity closed her eyes. \"Jonas, don\u0027t talk like that. We\u0027re not in the business of removing curses from haunted houses. You\u0027re a consultant, not a ghost hunter. You authenticate things. You do nifty little articles on the historical significance of old weapons and villas, and maybe an occasional treasure. That\u0027s it. End of job description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s here, Verity. I know it is.\" Apparently Jonas was not paying much attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s here?\" she demanded, scowling in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The treasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you nuts? It\u0027s gone. The chest is empty. Someone has already been in here and scarfed up the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he casually knifed poor Digby on the way out the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you knew the crystal was still around,\" Jonas reminded her softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity was still holding her warm red crystal earrings. She glanced at the crystal on the desk in the vision and it seemed to wink at her. \"That\u0027s different,\" she said with great certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not. You know the crystal is still here in the villa and I know the treasure is still here. Whatever that guy was trying to protect is still locked away, safe and sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a tough man to argue with,\" Verity said with a sigh. She knew he was experiencing the same sense of certainty as she felt. There was no way to contradict such a feeling with logic. \"Okay, for the sake of discussion, let\u0027s say you\u0027re right. What do we do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to talk Doug Warwick into letting us stay here awhile longer,\" Jonas said, moving back across the room to stand beside her. They both gazed at the image. The menacing man at the desk gazed back implacably. \"I have a strong hunch he\u0027ll want to call a halt to everything when he returns tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t blame him. As you said, he\u0027s got what he wants, an authentication and a professional description of the villa for his buyers. Now that Elyssa\u0027s more or less out of the picture, Doug\u0027s not going to want to spend any more time humoring her interest in psychic phenomena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to find out what\u0027s going on here, Verity. I need to know what that guy in the vision thought was so important he had to lock it away in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity turned her head to stare at Jonas. \"You think he\u0027s locked it in time? That he found a way to store it here in the time corridor or something? Jonas, do you realize what you\u0027re saying? You\u0027re implying the man in the vision had psychic talent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas nodded slowly, his eyes on the old man. \"Maybe the same kind I have. Verity, there\u0027s no reason to think I\u0027m the only man on earth who was born with the ability to enter this time tunnel. What if that guy could access it, too? What if he found a way to leave something hidden in it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity felt chilled. She clutched her parka more tightly around her. \"Now that\u0027s a thought that could very well keep me awake nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to know, Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it\u0027s dangerous? What if you\u0027re right about the sense of warning you get from this vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Booby traps.\" Jonas\u0027s half-smile was grim. \"The man liked to set traps. A real Renaissance type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I want the father of my baby springing any of those traps,\" Verity said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah?\" She didn\u0027t believe him for a moment. \"Jonas, I think we should call it quits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to find out what this is all about. I have to know the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that further argument was hopeless, so she stopped wasting her energy in that direction. \"Do you think you can talk Doug into letting you stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find a way.\" Jonas spoke with absolute conviction. \"Come on, let\u0027s get back to the room. We can\u0027t do any more tonight. We\u0027re going to need that crystal.\" Jonas handed the broken sword hilt over to Verity. The vision and the psychic corridor vanished. \"Can you really sense it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crystal? Yes.\" Verity thought about it as she followed Jonas out of the small room. \"I don\u0027t know where it is, though. I just got the strong feeling that it\u0027s here in the villa.\" She fingered her earrings. \"There might be a wayâ€¦ \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Jonas cut in eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oliver knows a lot about crystals. When he and I worked them together I could feel things. Jonas, I don\u0027t know. I honestly don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing. But it\u0027s just barely possible that Oliver could help me tune in to that missing crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want Crump involved in this,\" Jonas stated flatly as he led the way back down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity glared at his back. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t want him getting any ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ideas about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas halted abruptly and swung around. He was a dark, powerful mass behind the harsh beam of the flashlight. Verity could feel the masculine aggression and possessiveness radiating from him. When he spoke, his voice was cold. \"I don\u0027t want him getting the idea that you\u0027re some kind of psychic pal for him; that he can use you to help him tune in to those damn crystals he\u0027s always playing with. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Verity understood. She angled her chin in angry challenge. \"You mean you don\u0027t want him using me the way you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant she thought she\u0027d gone too far. In the shadows Jonas\u0027s eyes seemed to gleam like those of a predator. The stone passageway was suddenly more confining than ever, and Verity was trapped inside it. She held her breath but she never lowered her eyes from Jonas\u0027s hard face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Jonas who broke the dangerous impasse. \"Right,\" he said very quietly. \"I don\u0027t want him using you the way I do. I don\u0027t want any man on the face of the earth using you the way I do. I\u0027m glad we understand each other.\" He swung around and started back down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity followed, wishing she\u0027d kept her mouth shut. She was determined not to say another word until the storm of Jonas\u0027s anger had blown over. Sometimes a woman had to bide her time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stopped at the door that opened onto the torture chamber. Silently he found the opening mechanism and manipulated it until the door creaked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no ribald cracks about kinky lady torturers as Verity and Jonas made their way through the room and out into the hall. In fact, neither said a word all the way back to the bedroom. Verity was feeling quite cold as she removed her parka, and the chill was not a result of the villa\u0027s lousy heating system. She shouldn\u0027t have said anything about Oliver Crump, she decided morosely. It was obviously a subject best left alone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-64.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
