He was thanking somebody for coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked me to wait,\" I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda nodded, but she didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to convince me how frightening Allison SaintPierre can be, don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027ve seen the demo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Miranda blushed. It was hard to tell in the bug zapper light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"I feel bad now, talkin\u0027 about her the way I did. The minute you left the studio I felt bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re still uneasy about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. No. Let\u0027s forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression on her face told me she couldn\u0027t forget it, at least not for more than a few hours. She looked out toward the shed, where moths were starting to gather around the kerosene lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t approve of her seeing your brother,\" I supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda\u0027s expression hardened. \"Did you understand about Brent? About what Sheckly said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only that the words hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up straighter, pushing her back and shoulders and head against the cedar post like she was going to get her height measured. \"Maria was Brent\u0027s wife. She died two years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words of the song Miranda had sung the other night came back to me, one of the numbers I couldn\u0027t believe Brent could\u0027ve written. \"The Widower\u0027s Two Step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accepted the condolence with a shrug. \"Maria had diabetes. Juvenile insulindependent diabetes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way Miranda threw that phrase out, as casually as a doctor might\u0027ve, told me the disease\u0027s name had long ago become part of her family\u0027s vocabulary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t treatable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I mean yes, it was treatable. That ain\u0027t what killed her, not by itself. She tried having a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked at me, hoping I could guess the rest of the story without her having to say it. I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must\u0027ve devastated Brent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I said it I realized what a stupid observation it was. The man was fortytwo and still living in a barn behind his father\u0027s house. He didn\u0027t comb his hair or shave and he apparently wore his clothes until they rotted off of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while there,\" Miranda said, \"Dad had to lock up the guns because Brent was threatening to kill himself. That\u0027s what Sheckly was talking about. Even now, I think about Brent with Allison—the way she might let him down—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda stared at the lantern across the field. \"You know that expression—somebody\u0027s life is like a country song? That\u0027s us. Mother dying, then Brent and Maria—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming.\" She said it with absolute certainty. \"Mine is coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bug zapper is not normally the kind of illumination that helps me decide a woman is beautiful. But when Miranda looked at me I decided exactly that. I\u0027m not talking about cute—the vulnerable little kitten quality I\u0027d imagined in her when she\u0027d been onstage at the Cactus Cafe. There was a kind of quiet stubbornness in her face now that suited her well, a much older, steadier light than I\u0027d seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you—\" I stopped. I wanted to ask if Miranda lived here, in the tidy burgundy and blue room I\u0027d seen. I hoped she\u0027d say no, that the room was just a museum to her childhood. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to phrase the question and not sound judgmental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out I didn\u0027t have to. Miranda heard what I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"I\u0027m afraid I do. Brent—he didn\u0027t have much choice about staying here. Me, I guess it\u0027s just a matter of laziness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were other possibilities, but it would\u0027ve been meanness to challenge her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I said, \"Why wasn\u0027t it a choice for Brent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No medical insurance. Maria\u0027s medical bills were skyhigh. If Brent tried to get work, she would\u0027ve stopped qualifying for government health benefits. They were forced to stay unemployed. That little shack over there is about all they had, and that only because Daddy insisted. Maria accepted for them. Brent would\u0027ve been on the street first. He\u0027s too proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to associate the word pride with Brent. It took some effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom inside the kitchen Willis Daniels\u0027 voice laughed long and hard. He was saying good night to what must\u0027ve been his last departing guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you ask me out here for?\" I said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda stared at her hands. \"Inside—in my room— you didn\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not. I thought you were asking me to get Allison out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights of the last truck headed down Serra Road. As soon as they turned onto RR22, the kitchen erupted with shattering crashing sounds—like somebody sweeping a cane across a counter full of glasses. Willis Daniels yelled four or five obscenities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it got quiet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Miranda said, not in response to the noise but like she was merely carrying on our conversation. \"I wanted you to take me out of here. I don\u0027t give a damn where to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the VW a little too fast, rounding the ISPV curves on RR22 at fifty miles an hour. The wind blew around the convertible, coming at us from behind. It undid Miranda\u0027s hair from the scarf she\u0027d tied over her head and swept strands of black for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eward so it looked like they were in a desperate race to beat the rest of her face out of Bulverde. She made no attempt to push her hair back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred yards behind us, a car with cockeyed headlights was following leisurely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how to get to Les\u0027 office?\" Miranda asked the question so softly that I almost didn\u0027t hear her in the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d decided I was taking her to the agency\u0027s Victorian house in Monte Vista to spend the night. Miranda knew where the emergency key was. She said Les kept a guest room upstairs for touring artists and she didn\u0027t think he would mind her staying there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretty sure she was right about Les not minding. After a while she reached over and squeezed my forearm. Her hand felt incredibly hot in the cool of the wind. \"Thank you. You okay?\" \"Sure. My jaw hurts a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda let go of my arm. \"I\u0027m glad you took that punch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while there I thought you were Superman, what with smashing people into kegs and bringing croissants and guns to women in need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I got red underwear, though. Want to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Maybe later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rounded another curve. The headlights cut a swath across the woods. Light brown ghosts moved behind the cedar trees—deer, foxes, possums. The headlights behind us disappeared, then reappeared, still about a hundred yards back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we turned south onto I10 the cockeyed headlights turned with us. Ahead, the clouds glowed above San Antonio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were still a few miles inside the Avalon County line when the lights behind us started edging closer. \"About time,\" I said. \"What?\" Miranda asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowed down to forty and the headlights started to gain, then dropped back for a while. I slowed down some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally they gave it up. A red light blinked into existence on the top of the car and the handsiren started. It was a black Ford Festiva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What—\" Miranda started to say. \"Probably nothing,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many beers did you have?\" she asked nervously. We pulled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked in my rearview mirror. The guy coming up on the passenger\u0027s side looked like a badly shaved orangutan. He had pale skin, brutish features, and a little tuft of orange on the top of his head. One hand held up a flashlight next to his ear and the other hand was under his wrinkled brown blazer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy coming up on my side was a stocky blond in a turquoise polo shirt and slacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a side arm. Both men were staying close to the car, cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phew,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re carrying a Breathalyzer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey swept the convertible with their flashlights from about five feet back. The blond guy came up to my window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder different circumstances I would\u0027ve said he had a friendly and open face—big features, red nose, bristly moustache, wide unwrinkled brow with the hatband impression still engraved on it. Your basic Bubba. Nice guy to drink a beer with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent circumstances would\u0027ve been without the suspicious frown on his face and the light shining in my eyes and his left hand resting on his semiautomatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howdy,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubba frowned some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy with the orange hair came up next to Miranda and stared at her, almost resentfully. \"Miss Daniels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked startled, then seemed to come up with a name she wanted. \"Hey, Elgin. How you doin\u0027? How\u0027s Karen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Bubba. \"Elgin—that\u0027s his code name, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir. Nice. The courteous shakedown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElgin scratched his little tuft of orange hair, then stepped back from Miranda\u0027s window, then forward again. He looked uneasy. Poor guy had been planning a nice easy evening of police brutality. Two on one. No ladies present. Nobody that knew his name. This wasn\u0027t in the script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You step out of the car, please, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked at me for some kind of advice. I smiled. She tried to put that same smile on her face when she turned to Elgin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Elgin. I hope there\u0027s nothing wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElgin got her out of the car. He shone his light in my eyes, then swept it through the back of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in the case?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Bubba glanced back and sighed. \"It\u0027s a fucking guitar, Elgin. What do you think?\" Then to me, \"I need to see a license and the papers on the vehicle, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys want to show me some ID here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubba stared right through me. \"The papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow and easy,\" said Elgin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a pretty good idea what was coming. I reached for the glove compartment, for the insurance papers. I moved very slowly, keeping my hand in the flashlight beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my fingers were just about to the glove compartment handle Elgin swore loudly and drew his 9mm and yelled \"Gun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubba was quick. On the count of one, he had his semi auto in my ear and his other hand around my neck. By the count of five I had been dragged bodily over the car door and slammed into the pavement. One eye couldn\u0027t see anything. The other could just make out some fuzzy lights. Something large and hard and sharp was boring a shaft between my shoulder blades. I think it was Bubba\u0027s knee. It took him another few seconds to pin down my right arm with his free hand in a fairly decent joint lock. He should\u0027ve been pressing a little closer to the nerve above my elbow. It\u0027s more in capacitating that way. I decided not to volunteer the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stayed like that for a minute, maybe less. I couldn\u0027t see or hear Miranda, though every once in a while Elgin would say, \"Just stay back, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElgin made a show of searching my glove compartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take long for the warmth and wet of the asphalt to soak through my Tshirt. I think there were some pebbles in my left nostril and my jaw was throbbing again. My neck felt like it had been pried half off with a very large bottle opener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, Frank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it?\" BubbaFrank demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Elgin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up,\" Frank told me. No sir, this time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-30.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
