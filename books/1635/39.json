He dived for cover behind the robotic dolly and cov- ered his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brilliant flash of sapphire light was the last thing he ever saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECTION 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOPERATION:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIRST STRIKE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0510 hours, September 13,2552 (revised date, Military Calendar) \\ Aboard hybrid vessel Gettysburg-Ascendant Justice, in Slipspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief and his team, which now consisted of Grace, Linda, Will, and Fred, had been ordered to report to the Officers\u0027 Club—normally forbidden territory to NCOs. Of course, nothing about their circumstances had been normal for a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gettysburg\u0027s O-Club had a massive table of oak, scored with numerous gouges and scorches from a hundred cigars casu- ally set upon its surface. There was a bar stocked with bottles containing a rainbow collection of liquors, dusted with shattered crystal. The room\u0027s walnut-paneled walls were polished to a rich glow. Hung along those walls was the UNSC gold-fringed blue flag. There were also gold and silver citation plaques for merito- rious gallantry. There were photos of officers and past Captains of the Gettysburg. And most interesting to the Master Chief were tin Civil War daguerreotypes that displayed battlefields full of charging men and cavalry and cannons belching flash and thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb and Sergeant Johnson entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans snapped to rigid attention. \"Officer on deck!\" the Master Chief shouted, and they all saluted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At ease,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"Please sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief stepped forward. \"With respect, these chairs will not support the weight of our gear, Admiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" the Admiral said. \"Well, make yourselves as comfortable as you can. This is an informal meeting.\" He snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to see who was left on board and alive.\" He looked past the open doors to the Officers\u0027 Club. \"Lieutenant Haverson will join us shortly. He\u0027s investigating the site of Corporal Lock-lear\u0027s... accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA holographic projector pad upon the bar flickered to life, and Cortana\u0027s slender body appeared. Chunks of broken crystal on the pad refracted the light and distorted her image so she ap- peared half melted and cast prismed arcs of light onto the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Johnson stepped over to the bar and swept the pad clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Sergeant,\" Cortana said, looking over her re-sorted figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure,\" he replied with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana faced the Admiral. \"Sir,\" she said, \"you\u0027ll be happy to hear that I\u0027m detecting no signals, residual radiation, or any transient contacts ... which is precisely what you would expect from a normal Slipspace journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb nodded, sighed, and eased into one of the leather-backed chairs at the table\u0027s head. \"Well, that\u0027s one small blessing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And here\u0027s evidence that Doctor Halsey\u0027s crystal was indeed destroyed,\" Lieutenant Haverson said as he entered the room. He paused to seal the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaverson sat next to the Admiral and set a small plastic bag flat on the table. \"I found Locklear exactly where Cortana said he would be: B-Deck, the medical storage room. Overloaded electronics at the site are consistent with a high-energy radiation burst. . . as are the burns on the Corporal\u0027s body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced and added, \"If it means anything, his death was quick. And these\"—he tapped the plastic bag on the table—\"are crystalline fragments that I found at the site. At first glance they appear to be a match to the shard found on Reach.\" He shook his head. \"But what I found isn\u0027t sufficient mass to account for the entire crystal. So unless it was atomized and left no trace, a fact inconsistent with the presence of these larger pieces, then the rest of that crystal has to be somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana tapped her foot, and one of her eyebrows arched. \"If the radiation burst detected before our jump correlates with the destruction of Doctor Halsey\u0027s crystal,\" she said, \"then there is an alternative explanation. The timing between that explosion and the radiation flare was only forty-seven milliseconds. Since the crystal had unusual space- and time-bending properties, the missing fragments may have been \u0027squeezed\u0027 out of the ship and into Slipspace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaverson asked incredulously, \"You mean pieces of the great- est scientific discovery in human history are\"—he nodded past the walls of the Gettysburg—\"lost in Slipspace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Cortana replied. She shrugged. \"I\u0027m sorry, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least the Covenant can\u0027t get to it anymore,\" Admiral Whit-comb said. He flicked the plastic bag with his thick finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or if they do, they\u0027re only going to find a bunch of busted fragments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wish I knew why Locklear did it,\" Haverson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was quiet. John and the other Spartans shifted un- easily in their heavy MJOLNIR armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Johnson cleared his throat. \"The boy was a little on edge. After all he\u0027d been through, you\u0027d expect that. But he was an ODST—tough as nails and twice as sharp and used to getting pounded. He wouldn\u0027t crack. He had a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor Halsey,\" Haverson remarked and narrowed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had to have set this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn started to defend Dr. Halsey, but he stopped himself from arguing with an officer. Yes, her actions were inexplicable: She had exfiltrated Kelly, left them when they needed her the most, and given Locklear the alien artifact. John still wanted to trust her, though. Perhaps whatever she was up to was for the greater good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not start this,\" the Admiral said. \"I don\u0027t want anyone\u0027s perceptions colored by us discussing the \u0027whys\u0027 and \u0027what ifs\u0027 of this situation. Save it for the debriefing they\u0027re going to give us when we get back.\" He cast a sideways glance at the bar and un- consciously smacked his lips. \"From here to Earth it should be smooth sailing, and we can finally relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Permission to speak, Admiral,\" the Chief said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Granted. Speak your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wish to contradict you, sir, but perhaps it shouldn\u0027t be smooth sailing. And maybe we shouldn\u0027t relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb leaned forward. \"I have a feeling I\u0027m not going to like this. .. but explain yourself, Chief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief outlined his mission plan, how he and his team would take a Covenant dropship and insert into the ren- dezvous location for the invading Covenant fleet. They would then infiltrate their command-and-control center, the Unyielding Hierophant, and destroy it; that would hopefully cripple the Covenant force . . . or at least slow them down. Maybe even enough to buy Earth time to reinforce their defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral stared at the Chief without blinking and flatly replied, \"Mission request denied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acknowledged, sir.\" He remained standing, at stiff attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitcomb frowned, as the other Spartans also snapped to at- tention and remained stone-still. He sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand your motivations, Chief. I do. But I will not risk transporting your team to the Covenant rendezvous point,\" the Admiral explained. \"If we lose this ship, Earth never gets its warning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" the Master Chief replied, \"we will transition from Slip-space to normal space alone. Once the dropship clears the gravitational influence of the Gettysburg and the Ascendant Justice, the Slipspace field will deteriorate and we will enter normal space. You need never even stop. And only a minor course correction puts the Gettysburg on the correct trajectory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has a drop out of Slipspace ever been attempted in a ship so small?\" the Admiral asked. His heavy brows knitted together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Cortana said. \"Our Slipspace probes perform the maneuver all the time, but the shearing stress and radiation are considerable.\" She paused and looked toward John. \"The Spartans, however, in the MJOLNIR armor should be able to survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Should,\u0027 \" the Admiral echoed, his face grim. \"As much as I admire your daring, Chief, I still have to deny your request. You\u0027ll need Cortana to get past the Covenant security systems. She has to make it to Earth. With the data she\u0027s carrying on Halo, the Flood, and Covenant technology, she\u0027s far too valuable to risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood, sir,\" John replied. \"I hadn\u0027t considered that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaverson slowly stood and brushed the sleeves of his tattered uniform. \"I\u0027ll volunteer to go on the Master Chief\u0027s mission,\" he said. \"I have extensive training in cryptology and Covenant systems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb narrowed his eyes and reexamined the Lieutenant as if seeing him for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d never survive the Slipspace transition,\" Cortana told him. \"But...\" She tapped her lip with her forefinger, deep in thought. \"There might be another way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant icons entered the stream of symbols flowing along the surface of her holographic body. \"I discovered a file-duplication algorithm in the Covenant AI on Ascendant Justice. I successfully used it to reproduce my language-translation routines. I might use it to copy portions of my infiltration programming into the memory-processing matrix in the Master Chief\u0027s MJOLNIR armor. It won\u0027t be a full copy—there are replication errors and other side effects—but it would give the Spartan team access to some of my capabilities. Enough, I think, to get them through the Covenant security barriers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb sighed deeply. He stood, went to the bar, and then returned to the table carrying a bottle of whiskey and three intact crystal tumblers. \"I assume you Spartans won\u0027t join me in a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" John replied, answering for his team. \"Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral set a glass before Haverson, the Sergeant, and himself. But before he poured, he set the bottle down and shook his head as if a drink were suddenly the last thing he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You realize, Chief, that you and your team will be on your own?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat my first, my only priority, must be to get to Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My team is willing to accept the risk,\" the Chief said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The risk?\" the Admiral whispered. \"It\u0027s a one-way ticket, son. But if you\u0027re willing to do it, if you can slow the Covenant assault on Earth, then, hell, it might be worth the trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief had no reply to this. He and his Spartans had sur- vived against impossible odds before. Yet the Admiral was right: There seemed to be something final about this mission ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething that told John he wouldn\u0027t make it. That was accept- able. The cause more than justified the sacrifice of four when measured against billions of lives on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb stood and said, \"Very well, Master Chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMission request approved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief parked the groaning overloaded robotic dolly next to the side hatch of the Covenant dropship. The dolly held four tons of carbon-molybdenum steel I-beams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill unloaded the cargo and hauled it inside, where Fred and the Sergeant cross-braced and welded the beams in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the final reinforcement to the dropship. The interior of the craft was so cramped that two armored Spartans could barely pass one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had welded layers of lead, boron fibers, and Titanium-A hull plates they had removed from the Gettysburg. According to Cortana\u0027s calculations, this was the only way to give them better than fifty-fifty odds of emerging from a Slipspace transition with an intact ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb monitored the display of a computer re- pair cart, then looked up and said, \"Cortana is ready for you, Chief.\" He waved him over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief marched to the cart and let the Admiral hook up the interface to the base of his neck. \"This should feel just like a normal download,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChilled mercury filled John\u0027s mind just like it always did when Cortana entered and fused with his thoughts. This pres- ence, however, warmed too quickly, as if it were just thin ice melting against his body\u0027s heat. It was like a recollection of Cor- tana inside his head—not the real thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Initializing MJOLNIR armor systems check and subroutine unpacking protocols,\" Cortana\u0027s voice whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the real Cortana also spoke over the COM: \"Don\u0027t listen to her. She\u0027s only half the woman she used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you only copied the good parts,\" the Chief replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all good,\" Cortana replied tersely. \"Just don\u0027t get too used to a passenger you can order around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t dream of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Systems check complete,\" the copied Cortana whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All systems are functional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda approached the opposite side of the Covenant dropship; a robot dolly followed stacked with rifles, Lotus antitank mines, explosives, and crates of ammunition. She angled the dolly and led it up the loading ramp until it butted against the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred emerged from inside, and Linda handed him an armful of submachine guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief detected a slight limp to her stride and an almost imperceptible awkwardness to her usual fluid motions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened a private COM channel to Linda. \"What\u0027s your sta- tus? Are you fit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. This gesture was notoriously difficult to per- form in MJOLNIR armor with its force-multiplying circuits. It took a degree of concentration and dexterity that spoke volumes about Linda\u0027s true coordination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor Halsey would say I needed a month\u0027s bed rest,\" she wryly replied. \"But I\u0027m squared away, Chief. I still have this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked her sniper rifle off the dolly and slung it over her shoulder with a liquid grace. \"And I still have this.\" She patted her helmet. \"Even though the Covenant did their best to shoot it off last time.\" She stepped closer to him. \"I can take care of myself. And I can take care of the team\u0027s back. I\u0027ve never let you down, sir. I don\u0027t plan on doing so now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat John wanted to do, however, was order her to stay be- hind. But he\u0027d need her uncanny skill with the sniper rifle on this mission. He\u0027d need her so they could survive just long enough to stop the Covenant. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-39.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
