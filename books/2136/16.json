She\u0027d brought a bottle of wine with her, of which we were all partaking. Some of us more vigorously than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they bought it,\" said Allison, pouring herself yet another glass of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me more about Edwin,\" I said to Tara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s Junior\u0027s only son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your cousin,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Outside, rain slapped against the bungalow\u0027s windows. Tree branches groaned overhead, as the bungalows were closer to the surrounding forest. \"He was never much interested in the family\u0027s business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I bet he\u0027s interested in the family money,\" said Allison, laughing. \"Oops, sorry. Was that inappropriate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Tara. \"Of course not. You guys are here to find answers to my grandfather\u0027s death. I\u0027m not sure, at this point, if anything could be inappropriate, or if I would even care. And to answer your question...I\u0027m not so sure about his desire for money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lives fairly simply. In fact, he often lives here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Living here isn\u0027t living simply,\" said Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but even while he\u0027s here, he lives simply. In fact, he prefers sleeping in the basement. On a cot, of all things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s here a lot?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often. In fact, he\u0027s rarely not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he do here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, as far as anyone knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he take your grandfather\u0027s death?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the strange part,\" said Tara, looking up from her glass. \"He didn\u0027t seem to take it hard at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean just that. He didn\u0027t appear overly distraught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No tears?\" asked Allison, piping in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None that I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a room in the basement?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, but it\u0027s so cold down there. Drafty. Miserable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe he just wants to stay out of the way,\" said Allison. \"You know, since he\u0027s here all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" said Tara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe the cold doesn\u0027t bother him, I thought, sending it over to Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vampire? she thought back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. I thought. I think. I can see his aura, so that\u0027s a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProblem, why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t see vampires\u0027 auras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGotcha. So, is that why you had me shield my thoughts back at dinner? I nodded and turned my attention back to Tara. \"Were you here on the night of your grandfather\u0027s death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"We all were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTara next asked Allison for some more wine, who was only too willing to comply, and shortly, my friend and witness were both gone for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, and made notes in my case file, all while the girls giggled and talked and got drunker and drunker. I made a mental note to fire Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhetorically, of course. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-16.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
