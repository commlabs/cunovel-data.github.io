I think that might be a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug and Elyssa Warwick walked into the No Bull Cafe at two o\u0027clock the following day. Verity saw at once that Laura\u0027s brief descriptions had been right on target. Doug Warwick was a good-looking young professional, with expensively trimmed sandy brown hair and a salon tan. His shirt was Ralph Lauren\u0027s version of outdoor wear, and his khaki slacks had pleats in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity was impressed with the pleats. She had tried to persuade Jonas to buy a pair of pleated trousers the last time they had gone to San Francisco. It had turned into one of those all-too-frequent occasions when Jonas had, as Laura bluntly put it, put his foot down. They had come home with a new pair of Levi\u0027s that hadn\u0027t even been prewashed for the fashionable broken-in look. Clothes were not one of Jonas\u0027s passions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa Warwick was a surprise. Thanks to Laura\u0027s description, Verity had been prepared for the wide, luminous eyes and serene smile. What she hadn\u0027t expected were the undeniably attractive face, the lushly rounded figure, and the silvery blond hair worn in a sleek, shoulder-length bob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa was dressed all in white—a white silk shirt that was open one button lower than necessary for fashion, a white wool trumpet skirt, and white ballet shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unrelieved white made a perfect backdrop for the glittering jewelry that adorned every limb, finger, and ear. Huge, sculpted pieces of metal hung from her ears; several rows of colorful necklaces swung over her full br**sts; her bracelets were wide cuffs that extended almost to her elbows; bands of gold adorned with small bells circled her ankles. She tinkled and chimed whenever she moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be Verity,\" Elyssa said warmly as she extended an elegantly shaped hand. Each graceful finger wore a ring, and her long nails were painted in a variety of glittering colors. \"Laura Griswald told us all about you. She said we mustn\u0027t miss your cooking while we\u0027re here in Sequence Springs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity escorted her guests to a table. \"Please sit down. I\u0027ll be able to talk to you in a few minutes. I just have to finish up some things in the kitchen. Did you want something to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug Warwick spied the gleaming copper espresso machine in the corner and smiled. \"Maybe a cup of espresso, or a café au lait. We ate lunch in the spa dining room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity nodded. She\u0027d had an espresso machine installed two months earlier. Actually, Jonas had installed it. He\u0027d had the huge, complex machine up and running within two hours of its arrival. He really was quite handy to have around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity made two small cups of potent espresso and carried them to the Warwicks\u0027 table. Doug and Elyssa smiled gratefully. A few minutes later the last lunch customer left, and Verity made herself a cup of tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you\u0027re looking for Jonas,\" she said as she sat down at the Warwicks\u0027 table. \"I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s out of town at the moment. Business, you know. He\u0027s doing some consulting work for a client in Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa stirred her espresso and looked seriously impressed. \"I imagine his work takes him all over the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity coughed slightly. \"His sort of work is international in scope, naturally. He certainly has done a great deal of traveling. I\u0027m expecting him back any day now, however. In his absence I handle certain business matters for him. May I inquire how you heard about him? For the past few years he\u0027s been working out of the country a great deal. He\u0027s only recently made Sequence Springs his business headquarters.\" She wondered if she was laying it on too heavily. If Jonas could hear her he would be looking around for something to clean his boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if Doug and Elyssa were concerned by the fact that the \"consultant\" they wanted to hire had based his world-wide headquarters in a small-town vegetarian restaurant, they were too polite to show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas was recommended to us by a friend,\" Elyssa said. \"A close acquaintance of mine who has the most extraordinary intuition. I explained to him the sort of expert we needed, and he asked around for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston has a wide variety of contacts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Preston Yarwood,\" Doug Warwick put in dryly, \"makes a hell of a good living running psychic self-development seminars in the Bay Area. Elyssa\u0027s been a faithful student for the past six months. He\u0027s into crap like channeling and metaphysical massage. He also drives a Porsche and wears hand-tailored suits. I suppose the guy must be doing something right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Doug, this is no time to make fun of Preston,\" Elyssa scolded in a gentle, sisterly tone. \"He\u0027s a very talented, highly intuitive man. A wonderful teacher. He\u0027s actually got precognitive abilities, although he\u0027s too modest to admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bull,\" Doug said cheerfully. \"He never loses an opportunity to remind people of his so-called visions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t deny that he found Mr. Quarrel for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity eyed the Warwicks closely. \"Just how did this Preston locate Jonas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa\u0027s smile was radiant. \"He contacted the editor of a small journal that specializes in Renaissance studies. You see, we need an expert in that particular era of history. The journal editor said he\u0027d just published an article by a Mr. Quarrel, who was quite knowledgeable about the Renaissance and might be just the man we needed. He told Preston that Jonas Quarrel once had quite a reputation for being able to authenticate almost anything. Apparently Mr. Quarrel did an article on fencing techniques for the journal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled complacently. \"You\u0027ve read it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid not, although I\u0027d certainly like to,\" Elyssa said with great charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just happen to have an extra copy,\" Verity told her smoothly. \"I\u0027ll let you have it. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find it very interesting. It\u0027s a brilliant piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly did you want Jonas to authenticate?\" Verity looked at Doug Warwick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sixteenth-century villa,\" he replied promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity stared at him. \"A villa? In Italy?\" Visions of a vacation in the Italian countryside danced through her head. This might be even better than a trip to Hawaii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug gave her a level look over the rim of his tiny espresso cup. \"I wish it were that simple. If Hazelhurst\u0027s Horror were in Italy, I wouldn\u0027t have the problem of trying to assure my buyers that it\u0027s genuine. But since it\u0027s located on an island up in the Pacific Northwest, things get complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good grief,\" Verity exclaimed. \"How did a sixteenth-century Renaissance villa get to an island in the Northwest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was taken apart in Italy before the turn of the century, shipped here to the States, and reconstructed by an eccentric relative of our late uncle, Eustis Hazelhurst. Our uncle Digby, who was just as nutty as his relative, inherited the place when Eustis died. Then, two years ago, our uncle died and I inherited the monstrosity.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-8.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 PM"}
