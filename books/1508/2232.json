In truth, her second brother was only around 2000 years of age, and it would be hard for him to play any role in the upcoming calamity.

Lin Ming had never revealed the location of this world to anyone. Besides her mother Sheng Mei who could locate this place due to the link between their souls, as well as their Aunty Mo, Mo Eversnow, who occasionally visited, there was never anyone else who came.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnd now this person had appeared from nowhere, their entire body overflowing with killing intent.

But, when she pulled out the sound transmitting talisman, that strange back remained as motionless as before. This caused her heart to sink. This other person absolutely realized her own little actions and yet didn’t care at all, simply remaining there like a rock. This was proof that he simply didn’t fear their father at all…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-2211\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-2213\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-2212","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:22 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:22 AM"}
