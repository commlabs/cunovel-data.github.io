Hence, the flames of war had surrounded the entire Eastern Xuan Region. Moreover, Dao Sect was the first to be hit and Yuan Gate had attacked them many times.

Nonetheless, it has been many years since he felt such a heartwarming sensation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Are you alright?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA gentle voice sounded in front of Lin Dong. However, that voice seemed to contain a faint trace of cold air, which could never be erased. Lin Dong lifted his head and saw Ying Huanhuan standing in front of him. When he saw her icy blue long hair, his heart began to ache gently. However, he still maintained a smile before he nodded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Lin Dong ah. Since you have returned to Dao Sect, why don’t you become an elder?” After Ying Xuanzi recovered his spirits, he led a crowd over before he asked with a laugh. Given his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell that Lin Dong was completely different from before. In fact, what Ying Huanhuan said previously was indeed true. As of now, Lin Dong was more powerful than him, the sect master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s fine. Just let me be a disciple of the Desolate Hall. I quite fancy that position.” Lin Dong shook his head. He was not really interested in an elder position. However, he did miss the days when he was training at the Desolate Hall.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, in that case, my Desolate Hall will definitely be the number one hall. I want to see who dares to fight with us for that position.” Wu Dao glanced at the three other hall chiefs in a pleased manner and laughed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe remaining three hall chiefs shook their heads helplessly. How could someone skirt the rules like this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s fine. I am a disciple of the Sky Hall. Therefore, even if he goes to Desolate Hall, our Sky Hall has no reason to fear.” Ying Huanhuan laughed. That rare smile gave off a cold refreshing sensation, which was similar to the sensation one felt the instant an ice mountain melted. It caused one to be involuntarily drawn to her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough this girl was becoming increasingly beautiful and now looked more elegant than before, the pride drilled deep within her bones was exactly the same as that three years ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That’s right, sect master. I still have some friends and subordinates outside. Can you open the formation and let them in?” When Lin Dong recalled that Little Marten and the rest were still waiting outside, he quickly asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Aye.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Xuanzi nodded without hesitation. He waved his sleeve before the sect guarding formation covering Dao Sect shook. Then, it gradually disappeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMoments after the formation disappeared, many rushing wind sounds appeared from a short distance away. Following which, a black cloud rushed over. Their frightening and ferocious aura surged towards the sky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis ferocious aura which had suddenly showed up, immediately caused the faces of countless Dao Sect disciples to turn pale. Initially, they thought that Yuan Gate had invaded them once again. However, their anxiety quickly died down after Ying Xuanzi dispatched some people to calm them down. Only after they realized that it was a group of men brought back by martial senior Lin Dong, did their anxiety turn into curiosity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA black cloud swept over. After which, they landed on a spacious training platform in Dao Sect. Thousands of black armoured Tiger Devouring Army soldiers stood like statues, and they did not move at all. Meanwhile, their breathing were in complete unison. In fact, their auras and brutality even caused Ying Xuanzi’s expression to change. After all, although his Dao Sect disciples have experienced many bitter fights over the last year, they were still greatly lacking compared to this Tiger Devouring Army, whose soldiers have all climbed up from piles of corpses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter the Tiger Devouring Army showed up, a couple of figures leapt towards the mountain cliff where Lin Dong was located. After which, all of them revealed themselves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEven with Ying Xuanzi’s mental fortitude, shock still surged into his eyes when Little Marten, first elder Zhu Li, Liu Qing and the rest appeared. To begin with, he was an ultimate Samsara stage expert. Moreover, his strength had also surged over the past three years and he even vaguely comprehended Reincarnation Will. However, the ripples being emitted by the seven of them were much stronger than him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn other words, other than Little Flame, all seven of them were Samsara stage experts who had touched Reincarnation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBeside him, a tinge of shock also flashed across Ying Huanhuan’s icy blue eyes when she saw Little Marten and the rest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Xuanzi and the rest turned to face each other. Though they were shocked, immense joy also surged into their hearts.

Then, they looked at Lin Dong with a complicated expression in their eyes. It seems like the disciples of Dao Sects were not mistaken.
