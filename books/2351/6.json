Perhaps she was going home to fetch something she had forgotten. Perhaps not. Either way, I sniffed a clue here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to Mrs. Williams, vice principal extraordinaire, I now had a small list of Amanda Peterson\u0027s known friends from high school. To help facilitate my investigation, Mrs. Williams gave me the home addresses to the three names on the list. I thought that was a hell of a nice gesture on her part, and reminded myself to repay her with one of my most winning smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first house on the list was a massive colonial with a pitched roof, numerous gables and a wide portico. I pulled into the wrap-around driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell was answered by a cute teenage girl wearing matching sweatshirt and sweatpants that said UCLA. A girl after my own heart. She was blond, pretty, and quite small, no more than five foot two. Her big blue eyes were filled with intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I speak with Rebecca Garner?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Jim Knighthorse and I\u0027m a private investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled broadly, and her eyes widened with pleasure. I turned around to see who the hell she was smiling at. Turns out it was me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A real private investigator,\" she said, clapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned somber on a dime. \"You\u0027re here about Amanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Williams called and asked if it was okay to give out our address. So I knew you\u0027d be coming by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your parents home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m alone, so maybe we should talk out here.\" She stepped through the doorway and shut the door behind her. \"My parents said it would be okay for me to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led me to a wooden rocking bench facing the street. Rebecca, utilizing the full use of the bench, rocked us back and forth. A minute later, I was feeling seasick. I stopped the rocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she said. \"I\u0027m just a little nervous. I\u0027ve never talked to a real live detective before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re doing a great job of it so far.\" I pointed at the UCLA logo. \"Obviously you\u0027re highly intelligent and wise for your age if you intend to go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down. \"My dad went there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must be highly intelligent and wise himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a doctor. Intelligent, but I don\u0027t know about wise. Anyway, he\u0027s never home, so I really wouldn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a junior?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were silent. She started rocking again, and I put my foot out to stop it again. She ducked her head and said, \"Oops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you with Amanda on the last day she was alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got there around seven. Amanda and I went together because Derrick was working out at the gym, as usual. He\u0027s so boring. He never likes to party. All he ever did was work out, play sports and hang out with Amanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he love Amanda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her weight. The bench creaked slightly. I kept my foot firmly planted. No more swinging today. Rebecca looked away, brushing aside a blond strand that had stuck to her shiny lip gloss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. He loved her a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he killed her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that pretty quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He loved her so much. He would have done anything for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was Amanda seeing someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But at the time, there was another guy who wouldn\u0027t leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris, the guy who threw the party. He\u0027s always liked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she fool around with Chris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She never cheated on Derrick. They really did love each other. It was sweet watching the two of them together. They were always together and holding each other and kissing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about Chris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a senior. Used to play football, but got kicked off the team because he\u0027s an asshole. You like football?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand it. Just a bunch of boys jumping on each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That about sums it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They kicked him off the team because he was a partier and did drugs and probably never showed up for practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He always had it pretty bad for Amanda. I mean, you\u0027ve seen her picture. She is - was - so pretty. A lot of guys at school liked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially Chris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially Chris. He hated Derrick. Hated him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me as if I were the beach idiot. \"Because Derrick had his girl, and because Derrick was black. He was always making comments to Amanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Racially insensitive comments?\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"Those kinds of comments. Everywhere she went, he let her know it. It was horrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why go to Chris\u0027s party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It\u0027s high school, it was the only party being thrown that night. Plus Amanda said that Chris personally invited her and had apologized for being such a jerk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what happened at the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris was drunk when we got there. He was being a real dick. Usual Chris, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m just being supportive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and shook her head. \"You\u0027re kind of funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So anyway, we get to the party and almost immediately Chris hits on Amanda. You know, puts his arm around her and tries to kiss her, just being an asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Amanda do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She pushed him away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did Chris react?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same old shit. Put her down, put Derrick down.\" She grinned. \"Derrick\u0027s already kicked Chris\u0027s ass once for giving Amanda a hard time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like Chris needs another ass kicking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to do that from jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"So what happened next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amanda was pretty upset and left the party. I offered to go with her, but she refused, saying she wanted to be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t add that if Rebecca had been with Amanda, that Amanda stood a better chance of being alive today. Then again, there might be two dead teenage girls instead of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the last time you saw her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking away, blinking hard. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After Amanda left, what did Chris do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. He took off in his car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell the police this?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police never came by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police assume Derrick did the killing,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t blame them,\" she said. \"But I think someone set Derrick up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who doesn\u0027t like him very much,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. Where does Chris live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told me, and I gave her my card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice picture,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said, you are obviously a bright and intelligent young lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left her rocking alone on the bench swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Rebecca, Chris\u0027s house was three streets down. Look for the broken garage door and red mailbox. Turns out the house was seven streets down. She was close. Okay, not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one home, so I waited in my car, which really was my home away from home. I had wasted more time sitting in it than I care to dwell on. One of these days I was going to wise up and keep an emergency novel in the glove box for just such an occasion. I turned on the radio and listened to various sports radio programs. There had once been a time when I was the subject of sports radio. At least locally. Maybe again someday. I looked at my watch. An hour of my life had passed. I turned off the radio and put my seat back. The police hadn\u0027t investigated Amanda\u0027s murder very thoroughly. That much was obvious. They were confident the killer was Derrick. They had no reason to believe otherwise, and they did not look for a reason. Looking for a reason made their job harder than it had to be, especially when a kid with a knife was looking them straight in the face. According to the homicide report, an anonymous caller had tipped the police that the knife was in the backseat of Derrick\u0027s car. Convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, after a fitful nap, a silver Corvette squealed around the corner and bounded into the driveway. A lanky kid hopped out and stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than ready for a little action, I leapt out of my car and, perhaps a little too eagerly, approached him. The kid backed up a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris Randall?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about an inch shorter than me, about half the width of me, and certainly not as good looking. Not everyone can be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a badge or something?\" he asked. There was mild humor in his voice, and a whole lot of cockiness. I\u0027ve been told the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or something.\" I showed him my investigator\u0027s license. \"Can I talk to you about Amanda Peterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders bunched at the mention of her name. He recovered and walked around to the Vette\u0027s trunk and popped it open with the push of a button on his keychain. He reached inside and pulled out a ratty backpack. His hands were shaking. When he spoke again, the humor was gone from his voice, although there was still an underlying tone of arrogance. My question had unsettled him. \"Sure. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was last seen leaving your party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slung the pack over a bony shoulder. \"Probably should have stayed, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. You were also seen leaving the party shortly thereafter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled broadly, just your friendly neighborhood detective. \"So where\u0027d you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you talked to the police yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they would be interested to know that prior to Amanda leaving the party that you had verbally abused her and made racially insensitive remarks about her boyfriend Derrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me some more, then shrugged. \"I went on a beer run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Corner of Eighth and Turner.\" He leaned a hip against the Vette\u0027s fender. The mild amusement was back. His eyes almost twinkled. \"You think I killed her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Just doing my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found the knife in Derrick\u0027s car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knives can be planted,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t,\" he said. \"I liked her a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you were jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of the nigger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of the African-American. Yes. He had Amanda, and you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why not kill him? Doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"Sometimes it doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, fuck you.\" He turned and headed up to his front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a good day,\" I said. \"Study hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout turning, he flipped me the bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKids these days. They grow up so fast. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-horse-jim-knighthorse-1/page-6.html","bookId":2351,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:29 AM"}
