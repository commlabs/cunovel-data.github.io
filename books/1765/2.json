Their yellow eyes glowed and disappeared, glowed and disappeared. Even when movement and song finally stopped, she knew they were close, watching, waiting, calculating. They were wary but not afraid. Tourists with their careless eating habits and generosity had taught the animals to associate food with humans. There might yet be something for them here. So they stayed near but out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whimper came from somewhere above Skye and she spotted the child nestled high in a tree, arms and legs wrapped around the trunk. \"Can you climb down?\" she asked, her voice gentle, soothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child\u0027s voice quivered, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come get you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limbs were close together but many of them were not strong enough to take Skye\u0027s weight. It hindered her progress, slowed it, but didn\u0027t deter her. As soon as her body was even with Callie\u0027s, she told the little girl, \"I\u0027m going to help you turn around. Then I want you to wrap your arms around my neck and your legs around my waist. Can you do that, Callie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let\u0027s do it. Your mom and dad are really anxious for you to get back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye eased the little girl away from the tree and somehow managed to breathe even as the child locked her arms around her neck in a stranglehold. \"Easy now. We\u0027ll be down on the ground in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child clutched harder. \"Dogs. Bad dogs,\" she whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coyotes. They helped me find you. Now it\u0027s okay. They won\u0027t bother you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Skye\u0027s feet touched the ground she knelt. Callie continued to cling, not wanting to release her hold. The child was shaking, cool to the touch even in the mild night air. Skye untied the jacket she\u0027d secured at her waist before leaving the apartment. After she wrapped it around Callie, she asked, \"Can you eat something, Callie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" There was plenty of water in the camelback. She moved the mouthpiece to the child\u0027s mouth. \"Suck on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCallie drank for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got something that\u0027s banana-flavored and something that\u0027s chocolate-flavored. Which one do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Nana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye got out the power bar and peeled back the wrapper. While Callie ate, Skye pulled the radio off her belt, turned it on, and pressed the button to transmit. \"This is Skye checking in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell are you!\" Captain Rivera was back on scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got the child. She\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico came on, \"You\u0027ve got her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrapped in a jacket right in front of me. She had a big drink of water. Now she\u0027s working on a power bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the radio, Skye could hear a cheer go up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico asked, \"Any idea where you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m closer to the road than to where you are. I\u0027ll backtrack and go out where Callie came in. Are her parents on site?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We finally got them to go back to their hotel. We\u0027ll send a car to pick them up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll keep the radio on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do that,\" Rivera barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny number of responses flashed through Skye\u0027s mind. She didn\u0027t allow herself to voice any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child\u0027s trail was long and unorganized and often difficult to follow. Callie had been lost and panicky as she\u0027d crashed over and through the terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closer they got to the road, the easier it was to hear the cars. The traffic had increased since the grim discovery and Callie\u0027s rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl had stopped shivering. Now she clung to Skye\u0027s back, more asleep than awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kept moving. The trail led out of a thick grove of trees and up a steep incline. Skye could hear a car approaching. She saw its headlights in the distance as she crested the incline and found herself along the road. Automatically she reached for the radio. \"I\u0027m on the road. Do you have a cruiser heading back toward town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaldwell jumped in with a familiar order. \"Stay put. Hold while I get the captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye gritted her teeth. She was tired, battling physical and mental exhaustion. It had been a long night. And now she could see the first hint of light at the edges of dark sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the radio came to life again, Skye had her answer. The car in the distance turned on its flashing lights and siren. The sound cut across the night air and woke Callie with a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico\u0027s deep rich voice came over the radio, \"A cruiser is heading back toward town. Do you see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s coming our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Callie\u0027s parents are in it. Did you locate her entry point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ll be there in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cruiser picked up speed and closed the distance in record time. It screeched to a halt in front of where Skye and Callie waited along the road. Within a second, they were engulfed in arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Callie, thank God, oh God, my baby is safe.\" The woman\u0027s grip was strong with emotion. The man\u0027s was just slightly less fierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye stepped away from the hugging as soon as the little girl released her hold and was wrapped in her parents\u0027 arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young female cop stood grinning next to the patrol car. \"We\u0027ve been cruising back and forth waiting for you to come out. The timing was almost perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye laughed. Happy despite the grisly find earlier. A child lived. Many searches didn\u0027t end so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirens blared in the distance. Skye could see two cars coming their way fast. She moved away from the young cop and the reunited family. Once again she allowed herself to become wolfen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d all been here. The five, the niece, the child. Skye could almost picture it. The rental car had pulled into the turnout at the side of the road. The niece may have already picked up the two strangers, or maybe this is where they joined her. Brittany left the rental car, walked to another spot, where another car had parked. The child hadn\u0027t been with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll five with the tainted blood had stood here. Only two had gone to or come from where the rental car was parked. Skye went back to where Callie\u0027s steps had disappeared down the steep slope. There was the stench of foul blood several feet away from where the child had been-as though the strangers had started to pursue her but given up after a short distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye turned back as the unmarked car squealed to a halt behind the first cruiser. Caldwell and Rico climbed out. The captain got out of the next vehicle. \"Anything?\" he barked at Skye, careful to avoid meeting her eyes. From experience, she knew that he was anxious for her to be gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye doubted the police would find anything here. But she told them what she suspected anyway. When she was done, Rivera said, \"Caldwell will follow up for report purposes. You\u0027re free to go. The department thanks you for your help. Caldwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective opened the back door of the unmarked. A clear sign that Skye was to get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll ride along,\" Rico said. He shot an angry look at his superior officer. If Rivera noticed it, he let it pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye slipped into the car, not bothered by the captain\u0027s attitude. Cops were a complication she didn\u0027t need. She\u0027d just as soon not get into bed with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body tightened in argument as her eyes studied Rico. With one exception. She\u0027d make an exception for him. But even as she admitted it to herself, she doubted that he\u0027d ever cross the line to be with her. He was a cop and she was...a lot of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The department owes you,\" Rico said as Caldwell started the engine and pulled back onto the road. Despite trying to clamp down on his anger, he couldn\u0027t keep the hostility from his voice at the way she\u0027d been dismissed. A child was alive because of her. A murder scene was discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye half-smiled. \"Think the department will pay if I send a bill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the tension left Rico. He laughed. \"No. Rivera has been bitching about budget cuts all week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped the radio off her belt and handed it to him. Their fingers touched briefly and flashed icy heat up Rico\u0027s arm. His eyes locked on hers. He could swear he saw a flame deep in their centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t want to get charged with theft of departmental property then.\" Her voice was lazy, soft, amused. It was like velvet against sensitive skin. To Rico it was a siren call that had his cock hardening. Frustration rippled through him. This was why Rivera had ordered Cia to drive Skye home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarajo! He\u0027d see her all the way to her apartment and finish this. He\u0027d take her as soon as they got out of sight. To hell with what Caldwell might think. To hell with what the captain might say. He was on personal time now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaldwell hit the brake and swerved just enough to break the contact between Rico and Skye. He sent her a dark look. Her lips tightened into that disapproving line he was growing to hate. \"Sorry, something ran out in front of the car,\" she muttered then turned her attention to Skye. \"The crew at the murder site found a pentagram carved in a tree near the circle. What do you know about that kind of thing?\" Her voice made it clear that she thought Skye had more than a passing acquaintance with black magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye shivered even though it was warm in the car. She leaned her head back against the seat. Whatever had transpired in the woods last night was dark and evil, something to be avoided. \"They drained her of blood. Probably in the circle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Rico muttered. \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaldwell whipped her head around. \"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye shrugged and didn\u0027t attempt an answer. She said, \"What do you know about the niece, Rico?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much,\" he answered. \"Just that Brittany was having some family problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Typical stuff. My take on it is teenage rebellion. That your take on it, Cia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Black clothes. Black fingernails and lipstick. Multiple body piercings-nose, ear, tongue, probably more but that was enough to make me lose my appetite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye laughed, which earned her a dark look from the detective. \"Drugs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that anyone knows about,\" Rico answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends out here in Vegas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, not that anybody knows about. Her parents are supposed to be going through her e-mails to see if she\u0027d made any connections.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye looked at Rico. \"You have a picture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He pulled the visor down, retrieved a picture and passed it to Skye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied the punked-out kid who favored black even for her body jewelry. Brittany looked like a hundred other kids that Skye had seen in ghettos and high-end clubs alike. Lost, searching, sometimes heartbreakingly hopeless. \"Okay if I keep this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Caldwell said instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it,\" Rico said at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an ongoing police investigation, stay out of it,\" Caldwell managed through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make a note of that,\" Skye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico started to chide the other detective then thought about the last case and wondered if he\u0027d done the right thing in letting Skye keep the picture. \"You\u0027ll pass on anything you come across, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Always.\" Amusement rippled through her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico tensed, sexual frustration making him edgy. He almost asked her to return the picture. Almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio in the unmarked came to life. Rivera\u0027s voice barked out an order for Rico to get back to the station as soon as the civilian was dropped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaldwell visibly relaxed. Rico wanted to howl with frustration. Even for the fuck of his life he couldn\u0027t disobey a direct order. Unwillingly, he glanced back at Skye. Her mouth turned up in the half-smile that made him want to take her down to the floor and shove his tongue past her lips while his cock tunneled in and out of her cunt. He wanted to ride her so hard that the only smile she\u0027d give him was soft and contented, not challenging or amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. Why couldn\u0027t he fall for one of the \"nice\" girls that his parents were always inviting over for dinner? Or at least one of the women who liked to hang out in cop bars and put out for guys wearing badges? Why\u0027d his dick crave this particular woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye had them stop the car several blocks away from her apartment. \"It makes the neighbors nervous when they see too many cop cars coming and going,\" she said as she gracefully slid from the unmarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll contact you later today,\" Caldwell said, \"for the report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me at least twelve hours to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaldwell nodded, anxious to get away from Skye...anxious to get Rico away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye\u0027s eyes met Rico\u0027s and darkened slightly. \"See you around,\" she said before shutting the door and heading down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched as she walked away. He wanted to follow her home and fuck her, then curl up around her body and sleep for twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. He couldn\u0027t take much more of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye rolled her shoulders in an effort to relax and let the events of the night fade. Even though she was physically tired, her body was tense, edgy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was changing. There was an underlying discontent now, a craving that hadn\u0027t been there before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she were like other women then she\u0027d say it was her biological clock ticking. But she wasn\u0027t like other women. And it wasn\u0027t the urge to have children that made her restless, it was the urge to take a mate-or rather, two mates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye wondered again about her origins. But she didn\u0027t attempt to search within herself. She\u0027d long since learned that any attempt to explore the dark well of forgotten past sent shards of excruciating pain through her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only vague, emotional memories of a happy time spent with a mother and two fathers, followed by the wrenching agony of separation, then later, the driving need to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had a computer hacker retrieve her records from the social services department. But there was nothing that she didn\u0027t already remember-she\u0027d been found in a ghetto of Los Angeles at the age of five, a silent child with no history, no name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she\u0027d discovered the ability to hypnotize and sink into a self-induced state of being other, any attempt at speech had caused a sharp skull-piercing pain to rip through her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could speak now without the threat of pain but she still couldn\u0027t retrieve the memories. It hadn\u0027t mattered for a long time but now she feared that it soon would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body was changing, making demands that her mind argued would be dangerous to her survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had gotten worse since seeing Rico again. And that couldn\u0027t be a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA city bus passed and disappeared around the corner. A dark blue Yukon with tinted windows trailed behind it. Even out of sight, she could follow the progress of the bus. Its brakes squealed in the early morning air as it rolled to a stop. The engine strained when it accelerated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye rounded the same corner a few minutes later and had only an instant to take in the scene in front of her and react to it. The blue Yukon was alongside the curb. A man had his arm around a woman\u0027s neck, his hand over her mouth as he pulled her toward the car. She struggled wildly but without effect-he was three times her size, large and well-muscled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation Skye pulled the knife from its sheath on her leg. The man never saw her coming, only felt the sharp, excruciating pain as a blade cut deeply along his rib cage. He bellowed in rage and released the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye crouched, completely focused on the man, ready for his charge. He took a step forward then stopped when the woman he\u0027d been trying to abduct began screaming. Panic replaced the anger. He hesitated only a second longer then jumped into the Yukon. Its driver gunned the engine and took off. The car fishtailed around the corner. There was no time to get a license plate number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman stopped screaming but couldn\u0027t seem to take her eyes off the bloody knife in Skye\u0027s hand. Skye slipped it back in its sheath as she said, \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded but she looked like the next loud noise would send her screaming down the street. \"Angry boyfriend?\" Skye asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t know him. I didn\u0027t know either of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye hated to ask, hated to lose the knife again, hated to think about being hauled into the police station for questioning but she offered anyway. \"I live close to here. You can come in and call the cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shook her head. \"No. Please. No cops. I\u0027ll tell my boyfriend about it tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye shrugged and felt a sliver of amusement creep in. Maybe for some women telling their boyfriends was enough. It wouldn\u0027t be for her. \"Suit yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Skye started to walk away, the woman stopped her with a tentative touch on the arm. \"Are you Skye Delano?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye studied the woman for a long moment. She was small, petite, delicate, with short black hair and skin so pale it suggested that she didn\u0027t see the daylight very often. \"Why do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s free hand lifted to her necklace in a nervous gesture. \"I was going to try and catch you at home. That\u0027s why I took the bus. I need your help. My sister\u0027s missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haley Warren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go to my apartment. You can tell me about your sister over coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman offered a tentative smile along with a nod of acceptance and they traveled the short distance to Skye\u0027s apartment. There was only one room, with a tiny bathroom carved out of a wall. It was spartan, a place to sleep and eat, but not to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you at making coffee?\" Skye asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley smiled. \"I\u0027ve been a bartender, waitress, and short-order cook. Does that qualify me to make coffee for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye laughed and felt at ease with her unexpected guest. She\u0027d long ago learned to trust her instincts. \"That\u0027ll do it. If you don\u0027t mind making some, I\u0027d appreciate it. I\u0027ve been running through the woods all night. I\u0027d like to hit the shower before we talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. Take your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Coffee beans are in the freezer. Grinder is next to the coffeemaker.\" Skye waved her hand in the direction of the kitchen-or what served as the kitchen-a couple of appliances behind an L-shaped counter in one corner of the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bypassed the sofa and chair, moved over next to the queen-size bed at the far end of the apartment, snagged some fresh clothes from the dresser before disappearing into the stamp-sized bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027d been alone she would have luxuriated in the hot stream of water then crashed. But those options weren\u0027t available to her now. So she took a quick shower, pulled on her clothes and went out to the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA steaming cup of coffee waited for her on an end table, along with sugar and a small container of half-and-half. \"You must have been one hell of a waitress,\" Skye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley\u0027s smile was quick and infectious. \"I always made good tips.\" Then her smile faltered. \"I don\u0027t know what you charge to look for a missing person, probably more than most waitresses can afford. I just want you to know, whatever you charge I can pay it. My boyfriend gives me money whenever I need it.\" She nervously touched the pendant on her necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was old and quite beautiful, the stone in the middle a deep, dark red. For an instant Skye felt pulled toward it-almost like a hypnotist\u0027s medallion. But then the sensation faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead and tell me about your missing sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you want me to begin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has she been missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you report it to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Haley bit down on her lip. \"Kyle, my boyfriend, has been looking for her.\" She began twisting the pendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering her visitor\u0027s earlier reluctance to call the police, Skye said, \"And he doesn\u0027t want you to call the cops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like they\u0027d do much anyway.\" Haley\u0027s voice was defensive. But then something inside her seemed to collapse. \"You might as well know all of it. Jen is eighteen. My parents live in Florida. She came out here about four months ago. She was hanging out with a friend, Amy Weldon, some hotshot senator\u0027s daughter. They were doing the club scene. At first I thought, okay, let her get it out of her system. I mean, I was like that when I was her age-fake IDs, hitting the bars, maybe saying yes to guys I should have said no to. It gets old after a while, especially if you don\u0027t have any money. And I knew Jen didn\u0027t have any money. I knew her friend Amy had to be paying for everything. So I thought she\u0027d get tired of it and cut Jen loose.\" Haley stopped and looked at Skye for encouragement to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye said, \"Only she didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, finally I said something to Jen about it. How could she mooch off her friend like that? She got pissed and said it wasn\u0027t my business but she\u0027d tell me anyway. Amy\u0027s grandfather left her a pile of money and as soon as she turned nineteen she was going to be rolling in it, so Amy didn\u0027t care if she cleaned out her checking account now. She was going to be nineteen in a couple of weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did your parents know Jen was out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley looked like she was going to cry. \"Yes. But they\u0027re real old-fashioned. I mean, real old-fashioned. They read the Bible every night. They go to church more than they go anyplace else. Vegas is Sin City to them. They won\u0027t step foot in it and they don\u0027t want to have anything to do with Jen or me until we repent and come back home on our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t blame Jen for not wanting to go back. But the more I saw her with Amy, the more worried I got. I thought maybe if Jen went back home, even for a little while, she\u0027d chill out, find a different friend. So I called my parents and begged them to come out here and get her but they just started preaching about hell and damnation and repenting before my soul was lost for good. And then a week later Jen disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t think she left town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She loved Vegas. And she would have told me if she was leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you talked to the friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since right after Jen disappeared. Amy was totally creepy about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you worry about Jen and Amy being together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever been to a nightclub called Fangs?\" Haley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy and Jen hung out there. It\u0027s for the Goth crowd. You know, Gothic. Vampires. That kind of thing. They were at the club every night. It was okay at first. I mean, that\u0027s the club Kyle and I go to. But then they started to get more and more into the scene. Finally Kyle fixed it so the bouncers wouldn\u0027t let Amy and Jen in anymore. He told me to stay away from them.\" Haley was twisting the pendant continuously now. \"He\u0027s really protective of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye let the last comment pass. \"Why did he want you to stay away from them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Amy was really, really into the occult. And Jen started getting into it too.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skye-s-trail-the-angelini-1/page-2.html","bookId":1765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM"}
