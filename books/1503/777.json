Although he had heard Zhou Weiqing speak of the Destruction Attribute, he had not imagined that it would be that disgusting.

The Destruction Attribute is not only powerful, the more users of it there are wielding it simultaneously, the stronger it becomes. If we were just using our own powers and attributes against you, we will naturally be unable to hold you down here. However, with the Destruction Attribute, we now have common points to work together, and with its superimposing effects, you won’t even be able to dream of leaving this place.

To the Heavenly King, this happened just so suddenly.

What did that mean? It proved that this person’s cultivation and power was far beyond his own, and the only thing that could possibly have any effect would be to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus, to launch this most powerful attack. If he could cause that unknown enemy to show some fear, perhaps he might just barely survive. When one reached the Heavenly King stage, even their intelligence would increase along with their cultivation. He had made the best decision possible in that situation without pause.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlas, though the decision was indeed correct, the situation did not develop as he hoped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA terrifying Devouring force caused the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King to instantly feel as if his body was in the ocean… in a whirlpool. His attempt at using his will to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus was instantly frozen, before his Heavenly Energy gushed out of his body. His Heavenly Core Nucleus seemed to be no longer under his control, that unbelievable suction force keeping it in place, unable to move.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith one ray of Destruction Attribute suppression energies suddenly disappearing, Long Shiya’s six-coloured lights naturally strengthened again. As for the rest of the Blood Red Hell party, it was only at that point when his power strengthened explosively that they realised something had gone wrong.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn unison, their gazes turned to the Heavenly King powerhouse that had been ambushed. However, by the time they reacted and wanted to jump to his aid, it was already too late.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the Heavenly King powerhouse’s body as cover, they could not actually see what he had encountered. The only thing they saw was his body flying back in retreat, disappearing into the distance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this point, all these Blood Red Hell powerhouses dared not act. After all, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had his reputation there, and his power could not be underestimated at all. It took all of them joining forces to barely suppress him. Even if it was Meng Gui, he was only at the Mid Level Heavenly Emperor stage. If he were to fight alone against Long Shiya, he would not even last five minutes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was famous for his sustained combat capabilities. After all, no matter what, having six Elemental Attributes alone was not something ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters could compare with. The reputation of being the first below the Heavenly God stage was not given for nothing. Even any ordinary three or four Heavenly Emperors would not be a match for him, and the only reason he was being suppressed now was because of the Destruction Attribute.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Everyone, be careful.” Meng Gui shouted out loud.

The reason why he had originally chosen this method of continuous pressure on him was to ensure their losses would be at the minimum. Otherwise, if Long Shiya was allowed any small chance to counterattack, they would have to pay a heavy price. This was especially so for him, as he would be the first target of Long Shiya.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the constant suppression method using the Destruction Attribute, as long as they didn’t take action, if Long Shiya was the first to attack, he would only be led along by them, falling deeper and deeper under the pressure of their auras. Eventually, his energy expenditure would be far more than theirs, and in the end he would have no chance of any comebacks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlas, who could have known that such a sudden ambush would appear just like that, instantly lowering the pressure on Long Shiya, increasing the time this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor could hold out. Of course, if they continued with their method, they could still pressure him for the final result, besides taking a longer time. However, none of them knew how powerful this hidden enemy was, and he was still lurking about.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, no matter how Meng Gui thought about it, he could not understand how the Heavenly Bow Empire had another powerhouse like that. Duan Lingtian was a powerhouse in his own right, but he was still just a Heavenly King. He did not have the strength to grab a powerhouse of the same level without alerting any of them! To be able to sneak behind a Heavenly King without being detected, even an ordinary Heavenly Emperor might not be able to do so.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA mocking look flashed across Long Shiya’s face. In truth, a large portion of the surprise and nervousness was all acting on his part. Naturally, these enemies in front of him were powerful, but he had purposely stepped right into this trap. WIthout this huge ‘magnet for trouble’ that he was playing, it would be extremely troublesome to finish off all of these enemies. However, in the current situation… would these fellows dare to lax off in their suppression of him?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRight at this moment, another Heavenly King powerhouse on the other side also gave a muffled grunt, as his body flew back.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that moment, Meng Gui’s expression changed greatly. Without hesitation, he gave the order. “Attack!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe powerful Destruction Attribute suppression instantly turned into actual attacks. The greyish light mixed with intense flames burst forth from all four Heavenly Kings. At the same time, constantly glows of Consolidated Equipment appearing around their bodies appeared, as they began to unleash their full power.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that instant, Meng Gui had already made the judgement. If the first Heavenly King being ambushed successfully could be explained away as them being careless, then the second Heavenly King being ambushed successfully was not just so simple as that. This hidden enemy was definitely extremely powerful. If they continued on like this, although their numbers were superior, but facing these powerful enemies on the front and back, it would be difficult to say who would be the final victor. Their best choice now was to finish off Long Shiya as quickly as possible before hunting down the hidden enemy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the same time as the four Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings launched their attacks, Meng Gui disappeared in a flash, appearing right in front of Long Shiya. Covered with pitch black light, his hands were each covered with a Consolidated Equipment, a two chi long devil claw spike.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis devil claw spike was specially designed to break all kinds of protective Heavenly Energies. Added on to the berserk Destruction Attribute, this charge of his caused the air itself to be shredded, leaving a long black hole in his wake. Without question, he had also used his strongest attack.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the prior suppression of the Destruction Attribute aiding them, this joined attack of theirs was indeed extremely powerful. As long as this could injure Long Shiya severely, the following fight would be much easier. Meng Gui even had the confidence of killing Long Shiya on his own if that happened. When that happened, he could dispatch the four Heavenly Kings to surround them to defend against that hidden enemy, who they could turn their full attentions to after killing off Long Shiya. That would be a perfect victory.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlas, many times, the progression of events would never be the same as some people’s expectations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA Heavenly Emperor and four Heavenly Kings, with the same Attribute stacked multiplicatively, attacking simultaneously.
