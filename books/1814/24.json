Do you have clear water from a snowy mountain spring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody call Will Smith—aliens really have landed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh . . . we don’t get much snow around here, this time of year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have Greenville’s finest tap water, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. And she still hasn’t blinked. Not one freaking time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I only drink snowy mountain spring water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly raises his hand. “I’m jonesin’ for some onion rings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and put in his order. “Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvay sniffs the air, like a squirrel before a storm. Then she looks a little petrified. “Is that grease? Do you cook with actual grease?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a step back. She might be one of those wacked-out, PETA-loving, vegan people who are offended by animal byproducts—and the prospect of being doused with red paint isn’t too appealing at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah . . . yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covers her nose with bony fingers. “I can’t breathe this air! I’ll break out!” She turns to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd waits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess females aren’t the only thing she doesn’t make contact with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly opens it for her and she scurries out. I look at him, flabbergasted. “Okay, what the hell was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a Californian. They’re all like that. I think it’s from too much sun . . . and weed. They make Dee Dee look f**king mundane. Plus Evay’s a model, so she’s an extra-large kind of weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe won’t smell grease, but she smokes like a chimney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s why I’m happy I live in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the normal people are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell . . . lived, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk behind the counter to get a take-out box for Billy’s rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe rests his elbows on the counter, leaning over. “So where’s Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManhattan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe means Drew. You know—after the arrogant, inhuman, blue physicist in the Watchmen comics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“he’s not here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly looks surprised. Pleasantly so. “No kidding? I didn’t think he let you out of his sight, let alone out of the state. What’s up with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “Long story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds promising. hey—let’s hang out later. Catch up. I have to get Evay back to the hotel for her nap, then I’ll swing back and pick you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes squint. “her nap?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe lifts his chin defensively. “Yeah. Lots of people sleep twelve hours during the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand him his onion rings. “I know. They’re called vampires, Billy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then my mother walks out of the kitchen. “Billy! Amelia said you were visiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugs him and he kisses her cheek. “hey, Carol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks disapprovingly at his beard. “Oh honey, you have such a handsome face. Don’t cover it up with all . . . this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother is such a mom, isn’t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly defends his facial hair. “Why’s everyone hating on the beard? I like the beard.” Then he holds out a hundred-dollar bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the onion rings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head and pushes his hand back. “Your money’s no good here—you know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crash of breaking glass comes from behind the kitchen door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd George Reinhart’s voice: “Carol!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother clicks her tongue. “Oh, dear. George is trying to work the dishwasher again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe runs off to the kitchen. Billy and I share a laugh. Then he hands me the hundred-dollar bill. “Slip this into the register when your mom’s not looking, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s tough when you get to the point in your life—like we have—when you’re able to help the parentals financially, but they’re too stubborn to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe taps the counter. “Okay, four o’clock, I’ll pick you up. Be ready. And don’t wear any power suit or shit like that—this is a strictly jeans and sneaks kind of mission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I’d planned on. But still I have to ask, “Why? What are we gonna to do?” he shakes his head at me. “You’ve been gone too long, Katiegirl. What else would we do? We’re goin’ womping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Silly me. Of course we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly leans over the counter and kisses my cheek quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he grabs his take-out and walks out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave you ever gone for a ride in your car, after your last final exam or the beginning of a long weekend from work? And the road’s wide open, your sunglasses are on, and your favorite song is blaring out of the speakers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Then you know just what this feels like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow to explain it? I’m sure there’re various names for it, depending on where you live, but here, that’s what we call it. It’s like mountain climbing . . . only . . . with a car. Or a truck. Or any other automobile with four-wheel drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal is to scale a hill, the steepest you can find, and get as vertical as you can, as fast as you can, without flipping car. It’s fun—in a stupid, dangerous, adrenaline-junkie kind of way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t worry about my delicate condition. Billy’s truck is an off-road vehicle with safety harnesses instead of seatbelts. So even if we flip? I’m not going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re riding out to the hills right now, full speed ahead. Ohio isn’t exactly known for its hilly terrain, but there are a few spots where these abound. Lucky for us, Greenville is near them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows are open, the sun is bright, and it’s a comfortable seventy degrees. I yell above the sound of the stereo, “So . . . another new car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly smiles and rubs his hand lovingly across the dash. “Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this baby’s unpolluted by my cousin’s evil handiwork.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. I definitely need to check out Billy’s financial portfolio. The wind whips my hair around my face. I push it back and yell again, “Don’t be that guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What guy?’ “The guy that has a different car for every day of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpend your money on more practical things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe shrugs. “I told Amelia I’d buy her a house. As long as she doesn’t tell Delores where it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly and Delores love to rag on each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song on the radio changes, and Billy turns it up to maximum volume. he looks at me. And he’s smiling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-24.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
