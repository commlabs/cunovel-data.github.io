The night wind had swept away the rainclouds, producing a crisp, sunny Sunday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason had arranged to pick up Paige at the apartment. When he arrived, Paige was surprised at how pleased she was to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" Jason said. \"You look beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like to do today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige said, \"It\u0027s your town. You lead, I\u0027ll follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t mind,\" Paige said, \"I\u0027d like to make a quick stop at the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought this was your day off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, but there\u0027s a patient I\u0027m concerned about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" Jason drove her to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be long,\" Paige promised as she got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait for you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige went up to the third floor and into Jimmy Ford\u0027s room. He was still in a coma, attached to an array of tubes feeding him intravenously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse was in the room. She looked up as Paige entered. \"Good morning, Dr. Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning.\" Paige walked over to the boy\u0027s bedside. \"Has there been any change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige felt Jimmy\u0027s pulse and listened to his heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been several weeks now,\" the nurse said. \"It doesn\u0027t look good, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to come out of it,\" Paige said firmly. She turned to the unconscious figure on the bed and raised her voice. \"Do you hear me? You\u0027re going to get well!\" There was no reaction. She closed her eyes a moment and said a silent prayer. \"Have them beep me at once if there\u0027s any change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not going to die, Paige thought. I\u0027m not going to let him die... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason got out of the car as Paige approached. \"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no point in burdening him with her problems. \"Everything\u0027s fine,\" Paige said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s play real tourists today,\" Jason said. \"There\u0027s a state law that all tours have to start at Fisherman\u0027s Wharf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige smiled. \"We mustn\u0027t break the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFisherman\u0027s Wharf was like an outdoor carnival. The street entertainers were out in full force. There were mimes, clowns, dancers, and musicians. Vendors were selling steaming caldrons of Dungeness crabs and clam chowder with fresh sourdough bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no place like this in the world,\" Jason said warmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was touched by his enthusiasm. She had seen Fisherman\u0027s Wharf before and most of the other tourist sites of San Francisco, but she did not want to spoil his fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ridden a cable car yet?\" Jason asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Not since last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t lived! Come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked to Powell Street and boarded a cable car. As they started up the steep grade, Jason said, \"This was known as Hallidie\u0027s Folly. He built it in 1873.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll bet they said it wouldn\u0027t last!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason laughed. \"That\u0027s right. When I was going to high school, I used to work weekends as a tour guide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you were good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best. Would you like to hear some of my spiel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason adopted the nasal tone of a tour guide. \"Ladies and gentlemen, for your information, the oldest street in San Francisco is Grant Avenue, the longest is Mission Street - seven and a half miles long - the widest is Van Ness Avenue at one hundred twenty-five feet, and you\u0027ll tbe surprised to know that the narrowest, DeForest Street, is only four and a half feet. That\u0027s right, ladies and gentlemen, four and a half feet. The steepest street we can offer you is Filbert Street, with a thirty-one and a half percent grade.\" He looked at Paige and grinned. \"I\u0027m surprised that I still remember all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they alighted from the cable car, Paige looked up at Jason and smiled. \"What\u0027s next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to take a carriage ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, they were seated in a horse-drawn carriage that took them from Fisherman\u0027s Wharf to Ghirardelli Square to North Beach. Jason pointed out the places of interest along the way, and Paige was surprised at how much she was enjoying herself. Don\u0027t let yourself get carried away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went up to Coit Tower for a view of the city. As they ascended, Jason asked, \"Are you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fresh air had made Paige very hungry. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027m going to take you to one of the best Chinese restaurants in the world - Tommy Toy\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige had heard the hospital staff speak of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meal turned out to be a banquet. They started with lobster pot stickers with chili sauce, and hot and sour soup with seafood. That was followed by filet of chicken with snow peas and pecans, veal filet with Szechuan sauce, and four-flavored fried rice. For dessert, they had a peach mousse. The food was wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you come here often?\" Paige asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As often as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a boyish quality about Jason that Paige found very attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" Paige said, \"did you always want to be an architect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no choice.\" Jason grinned. \"My first toys were Erector sets. It\u0027s exciting to dream about something and then watch that dream become concrete and bricks and stone, and soar up into the sky and become apart of the city you live in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to build you a Taj Mahal. I don\u0027t care how long it takes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m one of the lucky ones, Paige, spending my life doing what I love to do. Who was it who said, \u0027Most people live lives of quiet desperation\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds like a lot of my patients, Paige thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing else I would want to do, or any other place I would want to live. This is a fabulous city.\" His voice was filled with excitement. \"It has everything anyone could want. I never get tired of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige studied him for a moment, enjoying his enthusiasm. \"You\u0027ve never been married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason shrugged. \"Once. We were both too young. It didn\u0027t work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to be. She\u0027s married to a very wealthy meat packer. Have you been married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to be a doctor, too, when I grow up. We\u0027ll married, and we\u0027ll work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took a bay cruise under the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge. Jason assumed his tour guide\u0027s voice again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there, ladies and gentlemen, is the storied Alcatraz, former home of some of the world\u0027s most infamous criminals - Machine Gun Kelly, Al Capone, and Robert Stroud, known as the Birdman! \u0027Alcatraz\u0027 means pelican in Spanish. It was originally called Isla de los Alcatraces, after the birds that were its only inhabitants. Do you know why they had hot showers every day for the prisoners here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that they wouldn\u0027t get used to the cold bay water when they were trying to escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true?\" Paige asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I ever lied to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon when Jason said, \"Have you ever been to Noe Valley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige shook her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to show it to you. It used to be farms and streams. Now it\u0027s filled with brightly colored Victorian homes and gardens. The houses are very old, because it was about the only area spared in the 1906 earthquake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason hesitated. \"My home is there. Would you like to see it?\" He saw Paige\u0027s reaction. \"Paige, I\u0027m in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We hardly know each other. How could you ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it from the moment you said, \u0027Don\u0027t you know you\u0027re supposed to wear a white coat on rounds?\u0027 That\u0027s when I fell in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jason ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a firm believer in love at first sight. My grandfather saw my grandmother riding a bicycle in the park and he followed her, and they got married three months later. They were together for fifty years, until he died. My father saw my mother crossing a street, and he knew she was going to be his wife. They\u0027ve been married for forty-five years. You see, it runs in the family. I want to marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the moment of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige looked at Jason and thought, He\u0027s the first man I\u0027ve been attracted to since Alfred. He\u0027s adorable and bright and genuine. He\u0027s everything a woman could want in a man. What\u0027s the matter with me! I\u0027m holding on to a ghost. Yet deep inside her, she still had the overpowering feeling that one day Alfred was going to come back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Jason and made her decision. \"Jason...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that moment, Paige\u0027s beeper went off. It sounded urgent, ominous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paige ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to get to a telephone.\" Two minutes later, she was talking to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason watched Paige\u0027s face turn pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shouting into the telephone, \"No! Absolutely not! Tell them I\u0027ll be right there.\" She slammed the phone down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Jason asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him, and her eyes were filled with tears. \"It\u0027s Jimmy Ford, my patient. They\u0027re going to take him off the respirator. They\u0027re going to let him die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige reached Jimmy Ford\u0027s room, there were three people there beside the comatose figure in bed: George Englund, Benjamin Wallace, and a lawyer, Silvester Damone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you know I\u0027m getting marriedl ... Her name is Betsy... . We\u0027re going to have half a dozen kids. The first girl is going to be named Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had so very much to live for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige stood there looking down at him, tears blurring the room. \"Damn you!\" she said. \"You\u0027re a quitter!\" She was sobbing now. \"What happened to those dreams of yours? I thought you wanted to become a doctor! Answer me! Do you hear me? Open your eyes!\" She looked down at the pale figure. There was no reaction. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Paige said. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\" She leaned down to kiss him on the cheek, and as she slowly straightened up, she was looking into his open eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy! Jimmy\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked and closed his eyes again. Paige squeezed his hand. She leaned forward and said through her sobs, \"Jimmy, did you hear the one about the patient who was being fed intravenously? He asked the doctor for an extra bottle. He was having a guest for lunch.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-19.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
