If he relaxed them, let his body go slack and dangle, if he flopped forward, then the rope around his neck would take up the slack and the world would shimmer and swim. So he pushed himself back against the trunk of the tree. He could feel his heart laboring in his chest, a pounding arrhythmic tattoo as it pumped the blood through his body...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEmeralds and sapphires and rubies crystallized and burst in front of his eyes. His breath came in shallow gulps. The bark of the tree was rough against his back. The chill of the afternoon on his naked skin made him shiver, made his flesh prickle and goose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s easy, said someone in the back of his head. There\u0027s a trick to it. You do it or you die.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was pleased with the thought, and repeated it over and over in the back of his head, part mantra, part nursery rhyme, rattling along to the drumbeat of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eTime passed. The chanting continued. He could hear it. Someone was repeating the words, only stopping when Shadow\u0027s mouth began to dry out, when his tongue turned dry and skinlike in his mouth. He pushed himself up and away from the tree with his feet, trying to support his weight in a way that would still allow him to fill his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed until he could hold himself up no more, and then he fell back into the bonds, and hung from the tree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the chattering started-an angry, laughing chattering noise-he closed his mouth, concerned that it was he himself making it; but the noise continued. It\u0027s the world laughing at me, then, thought Shadow. His head lolled to one side. Something ran down the tree trunk beside him, stopping beside his head; It cluttered loudly in his ear, one word, which sounded a lot like \"ratatosk.\" Shadow tried to repeat it, but his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He turned, slowly, and stared into the gray-brown face and pointed ears of a squirrel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn close-up, he learned, a squirrel looks a lot less cute than it does from a distance. The creature was ratlike and dangerous, not sweet or charming. And its teeth looked sharp. He hoped that it would not perceive him as a threat, or as a food source. He did not think that squirrels were carnivorous...but then, so many things he had thought were not had turned out to be so...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe slept.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe pain woke him several times in the next few hours. It pulled him from a dark dream in which dead children rose and came to him, their eyes peeling, swollen pearls, and they reproached him for failing them. A spider edged across his face, and he woke. He shook his head, dislodging or frightening it, and returned to his dreams-and now an elephant-headed man, potbellied, one tusk broken, was riding toward him on the back of a huge mouse. The elephant-headed man curled his trunk toward Shadow and said, \"If you had invoked me before you began this journey, perhaps some of your troubles might have been avoided.\" Then the elephant took the mouse, which had, by some means that Shadow could not perceive, become tiny while not changing in size at all, and passed it from hand to hand to hand, fingers curling about it as the little creature scampered from palm to palm, and Shadow was not at all surprised when the elephant-headed god finally opened all four of his hands to reveal them perfectly empty. He shrugged arm after arm after arm in a peculiar fluid motion, and looked at Shadow, his face unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s in the trunk,\" Shadow told the elephant man. He had been watching as the flickering tail vanished.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe elephant man nodded his huge head, and said, \"Yes. In the trunk. You will forget many things. You will give many things away. You will lose many things. But do not lose this,\" and then the rain began, and Shadow was tumbled, shivering and wet, from deep sleep into full wakefulness. The shivering intensified until it scared Shadow: he was shivering more violently than he had ever imagined possible, a series of convulsive shudders that built upon each other. He willed himself to stop, but still he shivered, his teeth banging together, his limbs twitching and jerking beyond his control. There was real pain there, too, a deep, knifelike pain that covered his body with tiny, invisible wounds, intimate and unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to catch the rain as it fell, moistening his cracked lips and his dry tongue, wetting the ropes that bound him to the trunk of the tree. There was a flash of lightning so bright it felt like a blow to his eyes, transforming the world into an intense panorama of image and afterimage. Then the thunder, a crack and a boom and a rumble, and, as the thunder echoed, the rain redoubled. In the rain and the night the shivering abated; the knife blades were put away. Shadow no longer felt the cold, or rather, he felt only the cold, but the cold had how become part of himself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShadow hung from the tree while the lightning flickered and forked across the sky, and the thunder subsided into an omnipresent rumbling, with occasional bangs and roars like distant bombs exploding in the night. The wind tugged at Shadow, trying to pull him from the tree, flaying him, cutting to the bone; and Shadow knew in his soul that the real storm had truly begun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA strange joy rose within Shadow then, and he started laughing as the rain washed his naked skin and the lightning flashed and thunder rumbled so loudly that he could barely hear himself laugh. He exulted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was alive. He had never felt like this. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf he did die, he thought, if he died right now, here on the tree, it would be worth it to have had this one, perfect, mad moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" he shouted at the storm. \"Hey! It\u0027s me! I\u0027m here!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe trapped some water between his bare shoulder and the trunk of the tree, and he twisted his head over and drank the trapped rainwater, sucking and slurping at it, and he drank more and he laughed, laughed with joy and delight, not madness, until he could laugh no more, until he hung there too exhausted to move.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the foot of the tree, on the ground, the rain had made the sheet partly transparent, and had lifted it and pushed it forward so that Shadow could see Wednesday\u0027s dead hand, waxy and pale, and the shape of his head, and he thought of the shroud of Turin and he remembered the open girl on Jacquel\u0027s table in Cairo, and then, as if to spite the cold, he observed that he was feeling warm and comfortable, and the bark of the tree felt soft, and he slept once more, and if he dreamed any dreams this time he could not remember them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy the following morning the pain was no longer local, not confined to the places where the ropes cut into his flesh, or where the bark scraped his skin. Now the pain was everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was hungry, with empty pangs down in the pit of him. His head was pounding. Sometimes he imagined that he had stopped breathing, that his heart had ceased to beat. Then he would hold his breath until he could hear his heart pounding an ocean in his ears and he was forced to suck air like a diver surfacing from the depths.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to him that the tree reached from-hell to heaven, and that he had been hanging there forever. A brown hawk circled the tree, landed on a broken branch near to him, and then took to the wing, flying west.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe storm, which had abated at dawn, began to return as the day passed. Gray, roiling clouds stretched from horizon to horizon; a slow drizzle began to fall. The body at the base of the tree seemed to have become less, in its stained motel winding sheet, crumbling into itself like a sugar cake left in the rain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSometimes Shadow burned, sometimes he froze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the thunder started once more he imagined that he heard drums beating, kettledrums in the thunder and the thump of his heart, inside his head or outside, it did not matter. He perceived the pain in colors: the red of a neon bar sign, the green of a traffic light on a wet night, the blue of an empty video screen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe squirrel dropped from the bark of the trunk onto Shadow\u0027s shoulder, sharp claws digging into his skin. \"Ratatosk!\" it chattered. The tip of its nose touched his lips. \"Ratatosk.\" It sprang back onto the tree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was on fire with pins and needles, a pricking covering his whole body. The sensation was intolerable.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis life was laid out below him, on the motel-sheet shroud: literally laid out, like the items at some Dada picnic, a surrealist tableau: he could see his mother\u0027s puzzled stare, the American embassy in Norway, Laura\u0027s eyes on their wedding day...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled through dry lips.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny, puppy?\" asked Laura.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Our wedding day,\" he said. \"You bribed the organist to change from playing the Wedding March to the theme song from Scooby-Doo as you walked toward me down the aisle. Do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I remember, darling. \u0027I would have made it too, if it wasn\u0027t for those meddling kids.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved you so much,\" said Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her lips on his, and they were warm and wet and living, not cold and dead, so he knew that this was another hallucination. \"You aren\u0027t here, are you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"But you are calling me, for the last time. And I am coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBreathing was harder now. The ropes cutting his flesh were an abstract concept, like free will or eternity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep, puppy,\" she said, although he thought it might have been his own voice he heard, and he slept.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was a pewter coin in a leaden sky. Shadow was, he realized slowly, awake, and he was cold. But the part of him that understood that seemed very far away from the rest of him. Somewhere in the distance he was aware that his mouth and throat were burning, painful, and cracked. Sometimes, in the daylight, he would see stars fall; other times he saw huge birds, the size of delivery trucks, flying toward him. Nothing reached him; nothing touched him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Ratatosk. Ratatosk.\" The chattering had become a scolding.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe squirrel landed, heavily, with sharp claws, on his shoulder and stared into his face. He wondered if he were hallucinating: the animal was holding a walnut shell, like a doll\u0027s-house cup, in its front paws. The animal pressed the shell to Shadow\u0027s lips. Shadow felt the water, and, involuntarily, he sucked it into his mouth, drinking from the tiny cup. He ran the water around his cracked lips, his dry tongue. He wet his mouth with it, and swallowed what was left, which was not much.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe squirrel leapt back to the tree, and ran down it, toward the roots, and then, in seconds, or minutes, or hours, Shadow could not tell which (all the clocks in his mind were broken, he thought, and their gears and cogs and springs were simply a jumble down there in the writhing grass), the squirrel returned with its walnut-shell cup, climbing carefully, and Shadow drank the water it brought to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe muddy-iron taste of the water filled his mouth, cooled his parched throat. It eased his fatigue and his madness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy the third walnut shell, he was no longer thirsty.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe began to struggle, then, pulling at the ropes, flailing his body, trying to get down, to get free, to get away. He moaned.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe knots were good. The ropes were strong, and they held, and soon he exhausted himself once more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn his delirium, Shadow became the tree. Its roots went deep into the loam of the earth, deep down into time, into the hidden springs. He felt the spring of the woman called Urd, which is to say, Past. She was huge, a giantess, an underground mountain of a woman, and the waters she guarded were the waters of time. Other roots went to other places. Some of them were secret. Now, when he was thirsty, he pulled water from his roots, pulled them up into the body of his being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had a hundred arms that broke into a hundred thousand fingers, and all of his fingers reached up into the sky. The weight of the sky was heavy on his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was not that the discomfort was lessened, but the pain belonged to the figure hanging from the tree, rather than to the tree itself. Shadow in his madness was now so much more than the man on the tree. He was the tree, and he was the wind rattling the bare branches of the world tree; he was the gray sky and the tumbling clouds; he was Ratatosk the squirrel running from the deepest roots to the highest branches; he was the mad-eyed hawk who sat on a broken branch at the top of the tree surveying the world; he was the worm in the heart of the tree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe stars wheeled, and he passed his hundred hands over the glittering stars, palming them, switching them, vanishing them...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA moment of clarity, in the pain and the madness: Shadow felt himself surfacing. He knew it would not be for long. The morning sun was dazzling him. He closed his eyes, wishing he could shade them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was not long to go. He knew that, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen he opened his eyes, Shadow saw that there was a young man in the tree with him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was dark brown. His forehead was high and his dark hair was tightly curled. He was sitting on a branch high above Shadow\u0027s head. Shadow could see him clearly by craning his head. And the man was mad. Shadow could see that at a glance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re naked,\" confided the madman, in a cracked voice. \"I\u0027m naked too.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that,\" croaked Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe madman looked at him, then he nodded and twisted his head down and around, as if he were trying to remove a crick from his neck. Eventually he said, \"Do you know me?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you. I watched you in Cairo. I watched you after. My sister likes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You are....\" the name escaped him. Eats roadkill. Yes. \"You are Horus.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe madman nodded. \"Horus,\" he said. \"I am the falcon of the morning, the hawk of the afternoon. I am the sun, as you are. And I know the true name of Ra. My mother told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great,\" said Shadow, politely.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe madman stared at the ground below them intently, saying nothing. Then he dropped from the tree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA hawk fell like a stone to the ground, pulled out of its plummet into a swoop, beat its wings heavily and flew back to the tree, a baby rabbit in its talons. It landed on a branch closer to Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hungry?\" asked the madman.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Shadow. \"I guess I should be, but I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungry,\" said the madman. He ate the rabbit rapidly, pulling it apart, sucking, tearing, rending. At he finished with them, he dropped the gnawed bones and the fur to the ground. He walked farther down the branch until he was only an arm\u0027s length from Shadow. Then he peered at Shadow unselfconsciously, inspecting him with care and caution, from his feet to his head. There was rabbit blood on his chin and his chest, and he wiped it off with the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShadow felt he had to say something. \"Hey,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" said the madman. He stood up on the branch, turned away from Shadow and let a stream of dark urine arc out into the meadow below. It went on for a long time. When he had finished he crouched down again on the branch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they call you?\" asked Horus.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Shadow,\" said Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe madman nodded. \"You are the shadow. I am the light,\" he said. \"Everything that is, casts a shadow.\" Then he said, \"They will fight soon. I was watching them as they started to arrive.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the madman said, \"You are dying. Aren\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Shadow could no longer speak. A hawk took wing, and circled slowly upward, riding the updrafts into the morning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMoonlight.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA cough shook Shadow\u0027s frame, a racking painful cough that stabbed his chest and his throat. He gagged for breath.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, puppy,\" called a voice that he knew.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe moonlight burned whitely through the branches of the tree, bright as day, and there was a woman standing in the moonlight on the ground below him, her face a pale oval. The wind rattled in the branches of the tree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, puppy,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to speak, but he coughed instead, deep in his chest, for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she said, helpfully, \"that doesn\u0027t sound good.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe croaked, \"Hello, Laura.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him with dead eyes, and she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe was silent, for a while, in the moonlight. Then she said, \"You are the nearest thing I have to life. You are the only thing I have left, the only thing that isn\u0027t bleak and flat and gray. I could be blindfolded and dropped into the deepest ocean and I would know where to find you. I could be buried a hundred miles underground and I would know where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the woman in the moonlight, and his eyes stung with tears.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll cut you down,\" she said, after a while. \"I spend too much time rescuing you, don\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe coughed again. Then, \"No, leave me. I have to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, and shook her head. \"You\u0027re crazy,\" she said. \"You\u0027re dying up there. Or you\u0027ll be crippled, if you aren\u0027t already.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" he said. \"But I\u0027m alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, after a moment. \"I guess you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me,\" he said. \"In the graveyard.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like such a long time ago, puppy,\" she said. Then she said, \"I feel better, here. It doesn\u0027t hurt as much. You know what I mean? But I\u0027m so dry.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe wind let up, and he could smell her now: a stink of rotten meat and sickness and decay, pervasive and unpleasant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost my job,\" she said. \"It was a night job, but they said people had complained. I told them I was sick, and they said they didn\u0027t care. I\u0027m so thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The women,\" he told her. \"They have water. The house.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Puppy...\" she sounded scared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them...tell them I said to give you water...\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe white face stared up at him. \"I should go,\" she told him. Then she hacked, and made a face, and spat a mass of something white onto the grass. It broke up when it hit the ground, and wriggled away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost impossible to breathe. His chest felt heavy, and his head was swaying.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay\" he said, in a breath that was almost a whisper, unsure whether or not she could hear him. \"Please don\u0027t go.\" He started to cough. \"Stay the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stop awhile,\" she said. And then, like a mother to a child, she said, \"Nothing\u0027s gonna hurt you when I\u0027m here. You know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShadow coughed once more. He closed his eyes-only for a moment, he thought, but when he opened them again the moon had set and he was alone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA crashing and a pounding in his head, beyond the pain of migraine, beyond all pain.
