He had long prided himself on his ability to fall asleep at will. It had come in handy during his years as a soldier. No one ever managed to acquire the correct sleep, either in quality or amount. He would steal his slumber where he could, and his friends had been eternally jealous that he could prop up against a tree, close his eyes, and be asleep within three minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not, apparently, today, even though he\u0027d traded a knobby tree for the finest mattress money could buy. He closed his eyes, took his customary long, slow breaths, and...nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing but Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d like to have said she was haunting him, but that would have been a lie. It wasn\u0027t her fault that he was a fool. And in truth, it wasn\u0027t just that he was completely desperate for her (although he was, and most uncomfortably, too). He couldn\u0027t get her out of his mind because he didn\u0027t want to get her out of his mind. Because if he stopped thinking about Grace, he would have to start thinking about other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility of his being the Duke of Wyndham, for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibility...Bah. He knew it was true. His parents had been married. All that was needed was to locate the parish register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, trying to push back the overwhelming feeling of dread that was bearing down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have just lied and said that his parents had never wed. But blast it, he had not known the consequences when he said that they had. No one had told him he\u0027d be crowned the bloody duke. All he\u0027d known was that he was so damned furious with the dowager for kidnapping him and with Wyndham for staring at him like he was something to be swept under the rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Wyndham had said, in that smarmy, superior voice of his: If indeed your parents were married....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had snapped out his reply before he had a chance to consider the consequences of his actions. These people were not better than he was. They had no right to cast aspersions on his parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too late now, though. Even if he tried to lie and recant his words, the dowager would not rest until she\u0027d burned a trail through Ireland in search of the marriage documents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted him to inherit, that much was clear. It was difficult to imagine her caring for anyone, but she had apparently adored her middle son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even though the dowager had not shown any particular fondness for him - not that he had made much of an effort to impress - she clearly preferred him over her other grandson. Jack had no idea what had transpired between the dowager and the current duke, if anything. But there was little affection between the pair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stood and walked to the window, finally admitting defeat and giving up on the notion of sleep. The morning sun was already bright and high in the sky, and he was suddenly seized by a need to be out of doors, or rather, out of Belgrave. Strange, that one could feel so closed-in in such a massive dwelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did, and he wanted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack strode across the room and snatched up his coat. It was satisfyingly shabby atop the fine apparel of Wyndham\u0027s he\u0027d donned that morning. He almost hoped he bumped into the dowager, just so she could see him all dusty and road-worn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost. But not quite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith quick, long strides he made his way down to the main hall, just about the only location he knew how to get to. His footsteps were annoyingly loud on the marble as he walked forth. Everything seemed to echo here. It was too big, too impersonal, too -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped. It was a female voice. Not Grace. Young, though. Unsure of her surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that - I\u0027m so sorry.\" It was indeed a young woman, of medium height, blond, with rather fetching hazel eyes. She was standing near the doorway of the drawing room he had been dragged into the day before. Her cheeks were delightfully pink, with a smattering of freckles he was sure she detested. (All women did, he\u0027d learned.) There was something exceptionally pleasant about her, he decided. If he weren\u0027t so obsessed with Grace, he would flirt with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to disappoint,\" he murmured, offering her a roguish smile. This wasn\u0027t flirting. This was how he conversed with all ladies. The difference was in the intention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said quickly, \"of course not. It was my mistake. I was just sitting back there.\" She motioned behind her to a seating area. \"You looked rather like the duke as you walked by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis must be the fiancee, Jack realized. How interesting. It was difficult to imagine why Wyndham was dragging his heels on the marriage. He swept into a gracious bow. \"Captain Jack Audley, at your service, ma\u0027am.\" It had been some time since he\u0027d introduced himself with his military rank, but somehow it seemed the thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bobbed a polite curtsy. \"Lady Amelia Willoughby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wyndham\u0027s fiancee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know him, then? Oh, well, of course you do. You are a guest here. Oh, you must be his fencing partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told you about me?\" The day grew more interesting by the second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much,\" she admitted. She blinked, staring at a spot that was not his eyes. He realized that she was looking at his cheek, which was still discolored from his altercation with her fiance the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, this,\" he murmured, affecting mild embarrassment. \"It looks much worse than it actually is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to ask about it. He could see it in her eyes. He wondered if she\u0027d seen Wyndham\u0027s blackened eye. That would certainly set her curiosity on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, Lady Amelia,\" he said conversationally, \"what color is it today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your cheek?\" she asked with some surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed. Bruises tend to look worse as they age, have you noticed? Yesterday it was quite purple, almost regally so, with a hint of blue in it. I haven\u0027t checked in the mirror lately.\" He turned his head to offer her a better view. \"Is it still as attractive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened, and for a moment she seemed not to know what to say. Jack wondered if she was unused to men flirting with her. Shame on Wyndham. He had done her a great disservice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, no,\" she replied. \"I would not call it attractive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No mincing words for you, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid those blue undertones of which you were so proud have gone a bit green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in with a warm smile. \"To match my eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, seemingly immune to his charms, \"not with the purple overlaying it. It looks quite horrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Purple mixed with green makes...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack laughed again. \"You are charming, Lady Amelia. But I am sure your fiance tells you that on every possible occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not reply. Not that she could; her only possible answers were yes, which would reveal her conceit, or no, which would reveal Wyndham\u0027s negligence. Neither was what a lady wished to show to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you await him here?\" he asked, thinking to himself that it was time to end the conversation. Lady Amelia was charming, and he could not deny a certain level of entertainment that came from making her acquaintance without Wyndham\u0027s knowledge, but he was still a bit wound up inside, and he was looking forward to time out of doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just - \" She cleared her throat. \"I am here to see Miss Eversleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who was to say that a man could not acquire a bit of fresh air in a drawing room? One had only to crack open a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you met Miss Eversleigh?\" Lady Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed I have. She is most lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" There was a pause, just long enough for Jack to wonder at it. \"She is universally admired,\" Lady Amelia finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack thought about making trouble for Wyndham. A simple, murmured, It must be difficult for you, with so beautiful a lady in residence here at Belgrave, would go a long way. But it would make equal trouble for Grace, which he was not prepared to do. And so instead he chose the bland and boring: \"Are you and Miss Eversleigh acquaintances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I mean, no. More than that, I should say. I have known Grace since childhood. She is most friendly with my elder sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And surely with you, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Lady Amelia acceded. \"But more so with my sister. They are of an age, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, the plight of the younger sibling,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You share the experience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" he said with a grin. \"I was the one ignoring the hangers-on.\" He thought back to his days with the Audleys. Edward had been but six months younger, and Arthur a mere eighteen months after that. Poor Arthur had been left out of any number of escapades, and yet wasn\u0027t it interesting - it was Arthur with whom he had ultimately formed the strongest bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur had been uncommonly perceptive. They shared that. Jack had always been good at reading people. He\u0027d had to. Sometimes it was his only means of gathering information. But as a boy he\u0027d viewed Arthur as an annoying little whelp; it wasn\u0027t until they were both students at Portora Royal that he realized that Arthur saw everything, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd although he had never come out and said it, Jack knew that he\u0027d seen everything in him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he refused to grow maudlin. Not right now, not with a charming lady for company and the promise of another at any moment. And so he pushed more happy thoughts of Arthur to the forefront of his mind and said, \"I was the eldest of the brood. A fortuitous position, I think. I should have been most unhappy not to have been in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Amelia smiled at that. \"I am the second of five, so I can appreciate your sentiments as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five! All girls?\" he guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" he said quite honestly, \"except that it is such a charming image. It would have been a shame to have sullied it with a male.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your tongue always this silver, Captain Audley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her one of his best half smiles. \"Except when it\u0027s gold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amelia!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both turned. Grace had entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Mr. Audley,\" she said, looking surprised to see him there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" Lady Amelia said, turning to him. \"I thought it was Captain Audley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" he said with a very slight shrug. \"Depending upon my mood.\" He turned to Grace and bowed. \"It is indeed a privilege to see you again so soon, Miss Eversleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed. He wondered if Lady Amelia noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not realize you were here,\" Grace said after bobbing a curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no reason why you should have done. I was heading outside for a restorative walk when Lady Amelia intercepted me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was Wyndham,\" Lady Amelia said. \"Isn\u0027t that the oddest thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" Grace replied, looking acutely uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I was not paying much attention,\" Lady Amelia continued, \"which I am sure explains it. I only caught sight of him out of the corner of my eye as he strode past the open doorway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned to Grace. \"It makes so much sense when put that way, does it not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much sense,\" Grace echoed. She glanced over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you waiting for someone, Miss Eversleigh?\" Jack inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was just thinking that his grace might like to join us. Er, since his fiancee is here, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he returned, then?\" Jack murmured. \"I was not aware.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is what I have been told,\" Grace said, and he was certain that she was lying, although he could not imagine why. \"I have not seen him myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alas,\" Jack said, \"he has been absent for some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace swallowed. \"I think I should get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you only just got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonetheless - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall ring for him,\" Jack said, since he wasn\u0027t going to allow her such an easy escape. Not to mention that he was rather looking forward to the duke discovering him here with both Grace and Lady Amelia. He crossed the room and gave the bellpull a yank. \"There,\" he said. \"It is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace smiled uncomfortably and moved to the sofa. \"I believe I will sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will join you,\" Lady Amelia said with alacrity. She hurried after Grace and took a seat right beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they sat, stiff and awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a fetching tableau the two of you make,\" he said, because really, how could he not tease them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And me, without my oils.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you paint, Mr. Audley?\" Lady Amelia inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alas, no. But I have been thinking I might take some lessons. It is a noble pursuit for a gentleman, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence, then Lady Amelia nudged Grace. \"Mr. Audley is a great appreciator of art,\" Grace blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be enjoying your stay at Belgrave, then,\" Lady Amelia said. Her face was the perfect picture of polite interest. He wondered how long it had taken her to hone the expression. As the daughter of an earl, she would have any number of social obligations. He imagined that the expression - placid and unmoving, yet not unfriendly - was quite useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look forward to touring the collections,\" Jack replied. \"Miss Eversleigh has consented to show them to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Amelia turned to Grace as best she could, considering that they were wedged up against one another. \"That was very kind of you, Grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace grunted something that was probably meant to be a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We plan to avoid cupids,\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cupids?\" Lady Amelia echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace looked the other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have discovered that I am not fond of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Amelia regarded him with a curious mixture of irritation and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack glanced at Grace to gauge her reaction, then returned his attention to Lady Amelia. \"I can see that you disagree, Lady Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is there not to like about cupids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe perched himself on the arm of the opposite sofa. \"You don\u0027t find them rather dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chubby little babies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carrying deadly weapons,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not real arrows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made another attempt to draw Grace into the conversation. \"What do you think, Miss Eversleigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t often think about cupids,\" she said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet we have already discussed them twice, you and I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you brought them up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned to Lady Amelia. \"My dressing room is positively awash in them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Amelia turned to Grace. \"You were in his dressing room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with him,\" Grace practically snapped. \"But I have certainly seen it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack smiled to himself, wondering what it said about him that he so liked making trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon,\" Grace muttered, clearly embarrassed by her outburst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Audley,\" Lady Amelia said, turning to him with determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would it be rude if Miss Eversleigh and I took a turn about the room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" he said, even though he could see in her face that in fact she did think it was rude. But he did not mind. If the ladies wished to share confidences, he was not going to stand in their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, he enjoyed watching Grace move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your understanding,\" Lady Amelia said, linking her arm through Grace\u0027s and pulling them both to their feet. \"I do feel the need to stretch my legs, and I fear that your stride would be far too brisk for a lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow she uttered that without choking on her tongue, he did not know.
