A SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT.","content":"\u0026nbsp;It leaked out after a while that Tom and Ferguson were intending to leave River Bend, and considerable regret was expressed by the other members of the party. Tom was a general favorite. His youth and his obliging disposition made him liked by all except Missouri Jack and his set. It cannot be said that his Scotch friend was popular, but he was, at all events, highly respected as a man of high principle and rigid honesty. This was not the way the miners expressed it. They called him a \"square\" man, and that word expressed high moral praise. They all felt that Tom was going off in good company. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before they went, the two had a chance for a speculation. Two weeks before, a man came to River Bend, across the country, with a horse and[Pg 122] wagon, the latter an old express wagon, which he had brought round the Horn from some one of the Eastern States. What had induced him to take so much trouble to convey such bulky articles was not quite clear. Now that he was a miner he had no use for them, and at River Bend they were not saleable. This man, Abner Kent, came to Ferguson\u0027s tent, where he and Tom were resting after the labors of the day.
