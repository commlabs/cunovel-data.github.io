That self was?and still is?the wife of a rich, handsome executive with an ocean-view house and his own security staff. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt was in that house, two years ago, that Bryce Palmer learned Bronwyn was pregnant with their first child. But Bryce\u0027s rage over his impending fatherhood touched off a chain reaction of emotional and physical traumas that wounded them both. For Bronwyn, it meant fleeing the perfect marriage to start over with nothing but a precocious daughter named Kayla to care for. For Bryce, it meant a tortuous two years spent blaming his wife for deserting him, and living with the pain of not knowing his child. Now a chance encounter has brought Bronwyn back into Bryce\u0027s life, both bearing scars?and neither knowing the whole truth of that fateful night that drove them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-husband-s-regret-unwanted-2.jpg","author":"Natasha Anders","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-husband-s-regret-unwanted-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:35 AM"}
