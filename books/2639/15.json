He glanced out the window and saw Nora\u0027s Audi sliding into the garage. \"It\u0027s Nora,\" he said. Quick thinking led him to believe that Spike\u0027s complicity in the tree should be kept a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spike, you need to leave, and now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Job\u0027s over, son, here\u0027s the other twenty. Thanks a million.\" He helped the kid down from the ladder, handed over the cash, and led him to the front door. When Nora stepped into the kitchen, Spike eased onto the front steps and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unload the car,\" she commanded. Her nerves were shot and she was ready to snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" he asked, and immediately wished he\u0027d said nothing. It was quite obvious what was the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes and started to snap, then gritted her teeth and repeated, \"Unload the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther high-stepped toward the door and was almost outside when he heard, \"What an ugly tree!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun, ready for war, and said, \"Take it or leave it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red lights?\" she said, her voice incredulous. Trogdon had used a strand of red lights, one solitary string of them, and had wrapped them tightly around the trunk of the tree. Luther had toyed with the idea of pulling them off, but it would\u0027ve taken an hour. Instead, he and Spike had tried to hide them with ornaments. Nora, of course, had spotted them from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she had her nose in the tree. \"Red lights? We\u0027ve never used red lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were in the box,\" Luther lied. He did not enjoy lying, but he knew it would be standard behavior for the next day or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which box?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027Which box?\u0027 I\u0027ve been throwing stuff on the tree as fast as I can open boxes, Nora. Now\u0027s not the time to get touchy about the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Green icicles?\" she said, picking one off the tree. \"Where\u0027d you find this tree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought the last one from the Boy Scouts.\" A sidestep, not a direct lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around the room, at the strewn and empty boxes, and decided there were more important things to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" Luther said, unwisely, \"at the rate we\u0027re going, who\u0027s gonna see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up and unload the car.\" There were four bags of food from a store Luther\u0027d never heard of, three shopping bags with handles from a clothing store in the mail, a case of soft drinks, a case of bottled water, and a bouquet of dreadful flowers from a florist known for his outrageous prices. Luther\u0027s accountant\u0027s brain wanted to tally up the damage, but he thought better of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would he explain this around the office? All the money he\u0027d saved now up in smoke. Plus, the cruise he didn\u0027t take getting wasted because he\u0027d declined to purchase travel insurance. Luther was in the middle of a financial disaster and couldn\u0027t do a thing to stop the bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get the Yarbers and the Friskis?\" Nora asked at the phone, the receiver stuck to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they can\u0027t come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unpack those grocery bags,\" she demanded, then said into the phone, \"Sue, it\u0027s Nora. Merry Christmas. Look, we\u0027ve just had a big surprise over here. Blair\u0027s coming home with her fiance, be here tonight, and we\u0027re running around like crazy trying to put together a last-minute party.\" Pause. \"Peru, thought we wouldn\u0027t see her till next Christmas.\" Pause. \"Yes, quite a surprise.\" Pause. \"Yes, fiance.\" Pause. \"He\u0027s a doctor.\" Pause. \"He\u0027s from down there somewhere, Peru I think, she just met him a few weeks ago and now they\u0027re getting married, so needless to say we\u0027re in shock. So tonight.\" Pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther removed eight pounds of smoked Oregon trout, all packed in airtight thick cellophane wrappers, the type that gave the impression the fish had been caught years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a nice party,\" Nora was saying. \"Sorry you can\u0027t make it. Yes, I\u0027ll give a hug to Blair. Merry Christmas, Sue.\" She hung up and took a deep breath. With the worst possible timing Luther said, \"Smoked trout?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either that or frozen pizza,\" she fired back with glowing eyes and clenched fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not a turkey or a ham left in the stores, and, even if I found one, there\u0027s not enough time to cook it. So, yes, Luther, Mr. Beach Bum, we\u0027re having smoked trout for Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang and Nora snatched it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, yes, Emily, how are you? Thanks for returning my call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther couldn\u0027t think of a single person named Emily. He pulled out a three-pound block of Cheddar cheese, a large wedge of Swiss, boxes of crackers, clam dip, and three two-day-old chocolate pies from a bakery Nora had always avoided. She was rattling on about their last-minute party, when suddenly she said, \"You can come! That\u0027s wonderful. Around sevenish, casual, sort of a come-and-go.\" Pause. \"Your parents? Sure they can come, the more the merrier. Great, Emily. See you in a bit.\" She hung up without a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily Underwood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther dropped a box of crackers. \"No,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was suddenly interested in unpacking the last bag of groceries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t, Nora,\" he said. \"Tell me you didn\u0027t invite Mitch Underwood. Not here, not to our house. You didn\u0027t, Nora, please say you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like Emily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a witch and you know it. You like her? When\u0027s the last time you had lunch with her, or breakfast or coffee or anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need bodies, Luther.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch the Mouth is not a body, he\u0027s a windbag. A thundering load of hot air. People hide from the Underwoods, Nora. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re coming. Be thankful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re coming because nobody in their right mind would invite them to a social occasion. They\u0027re always free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hand me that cheese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a joke, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be good with Enrique.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enrique\u0027ll never again set foot in the United States after Underwood gets through with him. He hates everything-the city, the state, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, clean air, you name it. He\u0027s the biggest bore in the world. He\u0027ll get half-drunk and you can hear him two blocks over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle down, Luther. It\u0027s done. Speaking of drinking, I didn\u0027t have time to get the wine. You\u0027ll have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving the safety of my home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. I didn\u0027t see Frosty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not doing Frosty. I\u0027ve made up my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again, and Nora grabbed it. \"Who could this be?\" Luther muttered to himself. \"Can\u0027t get any worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair,\" Nora said. \"Hello, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gimme the phone,\" Luther kept muttering. \"I\u0027ll send \u0027em back to Peru.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in Atlanta-great,\" Nora said. Pause, \"We\u0027re just cooking away, dear, getting ready for the party.\" Pause. \"We\u0027re excited too, dear, can\u0027t wait.\" Pause. \"Of course I\u0027m making a caramel cream pie, your favorite.\" She shot Luther a look of horror. \"Yes, honey, we\u0027ll be at the airport at six. Love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther glanced at his watch. Three o\u0027clock. She hung up and said, \"I need two pounds of caramel and a jar of marshmallow cream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll finish the tree-it still needs more ornaments,\" Luther said, \"I\u0027m not fighting the mobs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora chewed a fingernail for a second and assessed things. This meant a plan was coming, probably one with a lot of detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do this,\" she began. \"Let\u0027s finish decorating by four. How long will Frosty take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At four, I\u0027ll make the final run to town, and you get Frosty up on the roof. Meanwhile, we\u0027ll go through the phone book and call everybody we\u0027ve ever met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell anyone Underwood\u0027s coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, Luther!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smoked trout with Mitch Underwood. That\u0027ll be the hottest ticket in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora put on a Sinatra Christmas CD, and for twenty minutes Luther flung more ornaments on Trogdon\u0027s tree while Nora set out candles and ceramic Santas and decorated the fireplace mantel with plastic holly and mistletoe. They said nothing to each other for a long time, then Nora broke the ice with more instructions. \"These boxes can go back to the attic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the things Luther hated about Christmas, perhaps the most dreaded chore was hauling boxes up and down the retractable stairs of the attic. Up the staircase to the second floor, then wedge into the narrow hallway between two bedrooms, then readjust positions so that the box, which was inevitably too big, could be shoved up the flimsy ladder through the opening to the attic. Coming down or going up, it didn\u0027t matter. It was a miracle he\u0027d avoided serious injury over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after that, start bringing Frosty up,\" she barked like an admiral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned hard on Reverend Zabriskie, and he finally said he could stop by for half an hour. Luther, at gunpoint, called his secretary, Dox, and twisted her arm until she agreed to stop by for a few minutes. Dox had been married three times, was currently unmarried but always had a boyfriend of some variety. The two of them, plus Reverend and Mrs. Zabriskie, plus the Underwood group, totaled an optimistic eight, if they all converged at the same time. Twelve altogether with the Kranks and Blair and Enrique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve almost made Nora cry again. Twelve would seem like three in their living room on Christmas Eve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called her two favorite wine stores. One was closed, the other would be open for a half hour. At four, Nora left in a flurry of instructions for Luther, who, by then, was thinking of hitting the cognac hidden in the basement. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skipping-christmas/page-15.html","bookId":2639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM"}
