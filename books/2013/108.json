Clip was smiling, but it was a cynical smile, and it seemed his eyes held steady on Fear Sengar, as if awaiting some kind of challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Acquitor,’ said Silchas Ruin, releasing the clasp of his cloak as he walked over to the stone table against a far wall, where waited wine and food, ‘at least one mystery has been answered.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The preponderance of wraiths here in the Andara, the countless ghosts of dead Tiste Andii-I know why they are here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am sorry, I did not know this place was crowded with wraiths. I’ve not even seen Wither lately.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced across at her, then poured himself a goblet of wine. ‘It is extraordinary,’ he murmured, ‘how something as basic as the absence of a taste on the tongue can prove the most excruciating torture… when one is buried for thousands of years.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him take a mouthful of the watery wine, watched him savour it. Then he said, ‘Time, Acquitor. The Omtose Phellack ritual, which froze all in place, defied Hood himself-apologies, Hood is the Lord of Death. The ghosts-they had nowhere to go. Easily captured and enslaved by the Tiste Edur, but many others managed to evade that fate, and they are here, among their mortal kin. The Onyx Wizards speak of compassion and balance, you see…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, 1 do not, but I think that is of no matter. ‘Will the wizards help us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wry grimace from Silchas Ruin, then he shrugged. ‘Our fell party now has a new member, Acquitor, who is charged with guiding us to what we seek.’ Fear Sengar, suddenly tense, stepped close to Clip. Tiste Andii,’ he said, ‘know this, please. I possess no enmity towards you or your people. If indeed you will lead us to where the soul of Scabandari is bound, I will be in your debt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– indeed, all of the Edur will be in your debt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip grinned. ‘Oh, you don’t want that, warrior.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear seemed taken aback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You,’ said Silchas Ruin to the Tiste Edur, ‘pose the gravest threat to these Andii. Your kind has good reason to hunt down every last one of them; nor are the Letherii well disposed to them, given their resistance to the annexation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– a resistance that continues to this day. Bluerose does not appreciate being occupied; nor do the humans who lived in peace alongside those possessing Andii blood in their veins hold any loyalty to the Letherii conquerors. When the Onyx\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrder ruled, it was a distant sort of rule, reluctant to interfere in daily activities and making few demands on the populace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, Fear Sengar, your kind rule the Letherii, com\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epounding the resentment seething in Bluerose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I cannot speak for the empire,’ Fear said. ‘Only for myself. Yet I believe that, should events transpire in the manner I desire, then true liberation may be the reward granted by the Edur for their assistance-to the entire province of Bluerose and all its inhabitants. Certainly, I would argue for that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip’s laugh was sardonic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chain spun to wrap tight around his right hand, yet that served as his only comment to these grave pronouncements and bold promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac felt sick inside. Clip, this maddening pup with his chain and rings, his ever-mocking expression…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Fear Sengar, do not trust this one. Do not trust him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you certain you want to do this, Overseer?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar glanced across at the Atri-Preda. ‘This expedition is to be punitive, Bivatt. No formal proclamation of war has been made-the missive from Letheras is very clear on this. Apparently, it falls under my duties as Overseer to ensure that the engagement does not exceed its parameters. You march to hunt down and destroy those who slaughtered the settlers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes remained on the columns of Letherii and Edur troops marching along the road. Dust hung in the air, staining the sky’s bright blue. The sound from the army reminded Brohl Handar of broken ice groaning and crunching its way down a river. Bivatt spoke. ‘That is precisely my intention, Overseer. That and nothing more, as I have been commanded.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a moment longer, then shifted on the saddle to ease the strain on his lower back-he preferred admiring horses from afar to perching atop the damned things. It seemed they understood his distaste and reciprocated in kind, and this one was in the habit of tossing its head as it drew up from every canter, clearly seeking to crack Brohl’s chin. The Atri-Preda told him he leaned too far forward, and the horse knew it and saw the error as an opportunity to inflict damage. The Tiste Edur was not looking forward to this journey. ‘Nonetheless,’ he finally said, ‘I will accompany you.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-108.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
