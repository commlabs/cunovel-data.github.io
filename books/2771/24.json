I stand over her as she cries hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Caleb. I\u0027m so sorry,\" she says between sobs. \"I could have killed her, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stood there and watched as they handcuffed you. I let them take you away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so used to being the troublemaker, used to being the one who screwed up. Leah had been the squeaky-clean twin; I was the rebel. Even drunk, I didn\u0027t hesitate taking the fall for the accident. Leah wasn\u0027t going to be handcuffed, arrested, and convicted. She couldn\u0027t handle it. I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cops didn\u0027t question it when I confessed right there. Hell, my own parents never questioned my guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo think, it was all because Leah swerved to avoid hitting a fucking squirrel in the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over.\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Caleb, it\u0027s not. It\u0027ll never be over. I\u0027m going to carry this guilt around with me the rest of my life. I can\u0027t even look at Maggie. Hell, Caleb, I can\u0027t even look at you. It\u0027s so hard for me, you can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027s like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right, I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to me, she sucks in a frightened breath. \"You\u0027re not going to tell anyone, are you? Promise me you\u0027ll never tell anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at my twin, the girl who I shared my mom\u0027s womb with, shared birthdays with, and grew up side by side with. She should know me like I know her, feel my pain as much as I feel hers. She knows this secret is tearing me up inside. I can feel it just as much as I know how twisted her rationale has become. But she ignores me and focuses only on herself. She really is, after all, a stranger to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m humming an old song my mom used to sing to me when she put me to bed, back when I was scared of the dark and refused to go to sleep. Life was less complicated back then. My dad lived at home and Mom\u0027s only job was, well, to just be a mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she\u0027s working as a waitress and dating. Okay, that last part is my fault. I can\u0027t even blame my mom for her date tonight. Thanks to Caleb, I\u0027m finally coming to terms with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat first night he kissed me was magical. I was all ready to just be friends with him, cherish our platonic relationship, when it suddenly turned into something more. When I\u0027m with him I don\u0027t think about my limp. All I think about is how good it feels to be able to talk and share and kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I falling in love with Caleb Becker again? I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m so nervous and scared to be hurt again, I\u0027m keeping a wall up so my heart is protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle by little he\u0027s been chipping away at that wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter work we\u0027ve been getting off the bus two blocks away so we could steal an extra few minutes together. Unfortunately, today he had a meeting with some counselor from the Department of Corrections. He said it was important, so I hope it goes well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve forgiven him for the accident. Two days ago he tried to bring it up, saying he had something important to tell me about it. I cut him off with a kiss and promises of forgiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind is blowing, and the leaves are starting to fall. It\u0027s the end of summer. The trees and grass and flowers are getting ready for dormancy. As I plant the last of the daffodil bulbs for Mrs. Reynolds, I think of the winter they\u0027ll have to survive before thawing and being ready for their first peek of the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up from daydreaming about songs and trees and Caleb to find Mrs. Reynolds standing over me. I stop humming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure are cheery today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only have five more bulbs before I\u0027m all done,\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good thing, too,\" she says, looking up at the darkening sky. \"The weather is changing. I already feel a winter chill in the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\" After I finish the last bulb, we sit down and eat dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to invite you and your mother over for dinner one night. But only if it\u0027s okay with you.\" \"Why wouldn\u0027t it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because my son has been on more dates with your mother than he\u0027s been on in the past three years. I\u0027ve been coaching him, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Lou bring you chocolates the first time he came to your house?\" I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was my advice. I told him to bring yellow roses to your mom because they\u0027re the best way to start--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t yellow roses.\" She raises an eyebrow. \"They weren\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Tulips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yellow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Purple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. And the chocolates, they were caramels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frango mints. Very tasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tasty, huh? So much for mother\u0027s advice.\" I laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boss waves her arms in the air. \"Enough lollygagging, Margaret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re putting the dishes away, Mrs. Reynolds sways and holds the edge of the counter for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" I ask, taking the plate from her and leading her to the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These new medications are just wreaking havoc with these old bones, that\u0027s all. Nothing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do worry. Before I leave her house, I call Auntie Mae\u0027s Diner and tell Mr. Reynolds to check on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head to the bus stop after I\u0027m convinced she\u0027s okay. A car screeches by me as I walk. I recognize it as the same car with the guys who got in a fight with Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s Caleb Becker\u0027s retarded girlfriend,\" someone yells out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite the inside of my lip and keep walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she wants you, Vic. Why don\u0027t you show her a good time,\" someone else says. Then they all laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car is driving slowly beside me. I just hope they don\u0027t step out of the car. If I stop walking, will they get out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill they hurt me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep fear, so intense I\u0027m shaking inside, keeps me from stopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t go back to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house. It\u0027s too far and I can\u0027t outrun these guys. There are houses lining the street. I could try ringing a doorbell and ask someone to call the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plan forms in my head. I turn around and head in the opposite direction, the direction I just came from. But in the process I fall down. My hands are stinging and I feel sticky wetness dripping down my knee from the cut I\u0027ve just gotten from the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have a nice trip?\" one of them yells out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get up and hobble faster, praying they won\u0027t turn the car around and follow me. Because if they do, I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to handle it. I listen for the sound of the car turning around. I don\u0027t dare look back and give them another reason to come after me. But I can hardly hear anything besides the furious panting of my own breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief sweeps over me as the bus roars down the street. I hurry to the curb and wave the bus down, then glance to see if the car is still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" the bus driver asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I say, then scurry to the back to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing can cure me, no amount of physical therapy or surgeries. The old Maggie, the tennis star without a debilitating limp, the old Maggie, who could run away from danger, doesn\u0027t even exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb is outside mowing his lawn as I limp down the street. He stops the motor and rushes over to me as soon as he glances my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? Tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trying to hold back tears. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks around to make sure people aren\u0027t looking, then cradles my face in his hands. \"You\u0027re not fine. Damn it, talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze at him in despair. \"It was that Vic guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll kill him if he touched you,\" he growls, eyeing my ripped pants stained with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t. He and his friends just scared me, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make sure that never happens again, Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile warmly at him. \"You\u0027re not going to always be able to protect me. What are you going to do when I\u0027m in Spain, fly over and beat up all the bad guys who make fun of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said Vic was going to pay, but I didn\u0027t know how to do it ... legally. That is, until I was talking to the guys at lunch yesterday who told me Vic is competing for his school at our wrestling invitational today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am officially a Paradise Panther wrestler now. And I only have to beat out four guys until I come face to face on the mat with Medonia. As I suspected, we\u0027re still in the same weight class. I think the guy\u0027s using steroids to bulk up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in the locker room with the rest of the team, getting ready for the match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, you look like you\u0027re about to kill someone,\" Brian says as I jump rope to warm up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in the zone,\" Drew says. \"Ain\u0027t that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t answer. Coach Wenner stops me and pats me on the back. \"You haven\u0027t been to practice, Becker. You sure you\u0027re ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my mouth guard in. \"Yeah, Coach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI win my first two matches with a pin within the first minute. The third match took me a little longer. I think I pinned him in ninety seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CB\u0027s on fire!\" Tristan yells as he\u0027s plugging up a nosebleed from his previous match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus as they call me and Medonia up to the mat. I can\u0027t wait to wipe that smirk off his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your girlfriend?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than yours, any day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a cripple, Becker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be the cripple after this match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ref puts his hands between us. \"Keep it clean, guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the match starts, I push him with all my might until he falls. Unfortunately, he rolls off the mat and the ref blows his whistle. \"Caution, Panthers. Point for Fremont.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time we start, Medonia starts low. I move off the mat when the match starts and Medonia flies past me. The ref blows his whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the match starts up again, I get one more caution for an illegal hold which ends up with my elbow in Medonia\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more caution and I\u0027ll be disqualified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whistle blows, and the ref calls out, \"We\u0027ve got a bleeder for Fremont. Two minute break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach Wenner stalks over to me, eyes blazing. \"What are you doing? My team doesn\u0027t play dirty, Becker. Now either you go out there and try to win that match, or I\u0027m forfeiting it for you. Which is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds is going to be the death of me. She\u0027s determined to make me get behind the wheel of her black monstrosity sitting in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a classic,\" Mrs. Reynolds says, her chin held high as the garage door opens and reveals the Cadillac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ... I\u0027m really not ready to drive yet,\" I say. \"But you can drive it and I\u0027ll ride on the passenger side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds opens the passenger door and slides into the seat. \"Honey, my eyes can hardly see two feet in front of me. Come on, now. Time\u0027s a-wastin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hangs her hand out the window, the keys dangling from her fingers. She shakes them, the keys on the ring clinking against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m huffing and puffing as I slip the keys from her hand, hoping she\u0027ll get the hint. She doesn\u0027t. I open the driver\u0027s side door and slide into the front seat. Wow. The white leather is soft, and the back of the seat is as big as an old Lay-Z-Boy recliner. I look out the front window. The hood is wide and has that shiny Cadillac symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Mrs. Reynolds, who has her small purse neatly clutched in her lap, ready to go. Making the old lady proud of me would be so great. But... I\u0027m not ready. I think. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-24.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
