He pretended not to notice the seawater that permeated his cottage, the floor, the bedding….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe awoke early. Very early. It was still dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her forehead. “I’ve got something to do before we take off. Look out for the project for me—make sure Audrey’s priest and reporter are on the up-and-up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” she murmured, only half awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m locking the door. Keep it locked until you leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes…of course,” she mumbled sleepily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left. She stayed in bed, half awake, half asleep. To her astonishment, she found herself talking to the ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, come back. I want to understand. I want to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor took the exact same seat he’d had the morning before. The same waitress walked over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” she said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you this morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember me?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eggs, whole-wheat toast…I forget. Hash browns or grits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well done,” he congratulated her. “I’ll take hash browns, please. And do you really remember yesterday?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. “I’m twenty-two. No senility yet. Though my brother insists I’m definitely warped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a brother for you,” he said. “Do you remember the people I was with yesterday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you were with an older man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a younger man, too. Sixteen…seventeen…maybe even eighteen or twenty,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, smiling warily, as if he were trying to play some kind of trick on her. “I’m sorry, I didn’t see anyone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t eat. He just sat with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re pulling my leg, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile faded as she stared at his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You honestly saw no one else, other than the older guy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. He winced inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what it felt to be looked at like a crazy person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. I only saw the one man. Um, you wanted coffee, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little while later, as he was leaving, he paused at the door. Turning back, he saw Adam Harrison coming into the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid was with him, trailing behind him. He was tall and thin. Lanky, but good-looking, serious, a little grim, even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have a nice day, Mr. Thompson,” the host called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor nodded, then walked over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know Mr. Harrison?” he asked the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Nice guy,” the man said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the younger man as nice?” Thor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What younger man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor let out a sigh of irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That young man,” he said, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, that look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m really sorry, Mr. Thompson. I don’t know who you’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh Harrison stared straight at him and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor spun on his heel and departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the street. It was still barely light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the sun, trying to peek out and start the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am fucking crazy,” he muttered aloud, and started back for the resort and the docks, his strides long and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT here were no messages to Genevieve from ghosts or anyone else as she lay awake after Thor departed. She had actually tried to go back to sleep, actually wanted some kind of message. She was no longer going to be so afraid. And she wasn’t talking to anyone except Adam, Brent or Nikki—especially not Thor—about anything she saw, felt or sensed. She wasn’t going to fight the fear; she was going to find…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn’t fall asleep. So she rose, showered, drank coffee and watched the morning come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to do so slowly, especially since she couldn’t sleep. Drinking her second cup of coffee, she was struck with guilt. She was going to have to call Jay. There was no reason for him to waste his valuable time looking for a culprit in the “mannequin murder.” She was surprised to realize she really didn’t care who had been trying to play a trick on her. It didn’t matter anymore. Other matters were far too grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she grew tired of sitting alone in Thor’s cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun wasn’t really up yet. It was one of those overcast mornings. She hoped the storm clouds would quickly blow away, as they so often did. The heavy rains and thunderstorms didn’t usually come until the afternoon. Then it could rain like blue blazes for twenty minutes before coming to a dead stop. The streets could all but flood, and then the sun would come out again with a burning glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one at the tiki bar. Still, she didn’t feel like being alone in the little cottage. She frowned, wondering why Thor had disappeared so early again that morning. She might be keeping secrets, but so was he. They shouldn’t talk. They should just have sex. If only…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be an explanation for everything that was happening. She had to believe it would all make sense in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want to think too far ahead. They would have a prayer service that morning. At the very least, it would be a nice gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she sat there, the breeze picked up beneath the dark sky. It teased at her nape, snaked down the length of her spine. She shivered. It was a distinctly unpleasant, even eerie, sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t help herself. She looked around for ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she knew there were no spiritual beings trying to make contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she knew she was being watched again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the uneasy feeling she was being assessed, that her steps had been followed, her daily pattern mapped out, that someone was watching her with evil intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to laugh aloud at herself. Okay, so they were late bringing the coffee out to the tiki bar that morning, while there were heavy clouds up above. And the breeze had an odd, almost icy feel to it. Leaves were rustling, fronds making strange whispering sounds, but that didn’t mean someone was watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leapt to her feet, ridiculously afraid, sorry she had come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, what’s the matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung around. Thor was there, wearing his sunglasses despite the overcast sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his words, her unease evaporated. The clouds seemed to break. Light filled in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, smiling. “I heard you coming up at the last minute. You startled me, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was glad he smiled, that he pulled her close and brushed her lips briefly with a kiss. But then he pulled back. “The troops are coming. Look.” He pointed toward the parking lot. “The Exorcist himself has arrived.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not an exorcist,” Genevieve murmured. “He’s a nice guy. You’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left Thor and went to greet Father Bellamy, feeling guilty because she hadn’t been to church in a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext Sunday, she promised herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, Thor found that he did like Father Bellamy. The priest wore his collar with a lightweight suit, and he had a bag of dive gear with him, as well. His first question, after introducing himself to Thor, was whether he would allow him to enter the water as long as he swore to stay out of the way. It turned out he was an Episcopal priest, and he was dating the reporter, Helen Martin, who had also brought a dive bag. They were both in their mid-forties, down-to-earth, and both impressed him immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so nice that you’re doing this—such a sign of respect to someone who died long ago,” Helen told him. She grinned. “People in these parts can get excited about treasure, but they also want the past to be honored. I think this will make a wonderful piece. Thank you so much for allowing us to be a little part of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still no sign of Marshall, a fact they all seemed to silently accept as a bad sign. What the hell had happened to the man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor assigned Jack to the police boat with Alex, Bethany, Victor, Lizzie and Zach. He brought both Blackhawks, Audrey, Father Bellamy and Helen, and Genevieve with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut on the reefs, the boats tied on together, and Father Bellamy began his service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor had to admit it was both appropriate and well handled. The priest addressed no ghosts; he merely spoke to God about those who had been lost to sea, adding a special addendum for Anne, a young woman who died due to the perils of the sea. Flowers and wreaths were thrown into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen scribbled away on a notepad the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing occult about the proceedings. Nothing to make him uncomfortable in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over, Audrey looked at him with a questioning smile. He smiled back. She seemed to be trying very hard to do what was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Father Bellamy, too, looked at Thor anxiously. “May we hit the water now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Thor told him. He looked at Genevieve, who nodded. She knew they would remain dive buddies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany was staying topside with Nikki that day. On the other boat, Jack would be watching out for the divers, ready to assist anyone in trouble, keeping an ear out for the radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a long day, Thor decided. This wasn’t a professional and historically important dive anymore, he decided wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was running a party boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were times when it seemed appropriate to go with the flow. This kind of work could take months, even years. Best to get all the foolishness out of the way now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn Marshall. Where the hell was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched as Brent Blackhawk calmly buckled on his tank. He didn’t know why, but he had the feeling that Brent was the one with the deepest belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo? Wasn’t he seeing a kid who’d been dead for over a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. There had to be a logical explanation. Maybe it was all a tremendously elaborate hoax. But to what end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready?” he asked Gen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went out on three dives. Sadly—or thankfully—all three were uneventful. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vision-harrison-investigation-3/page-38.html","bookId":2269,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:01 PM"}
