He sighed and said, “In that case, you should know who I am, am I right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You… you are the husband of my ancestor.” Kun Ling’s face reddened as she respectfully replied.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eStanding beside her, Lin Dong was startled. Kun Ling actually had such a relationship with the Devouring Master. It’s no wonder the Devouring Master said that he could forget about obtaining his inheritance if he had abandoned Kun Ling and left her behind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, since the Devouring Master was married to that Kun Qing Er, why was it that he had such a murky relationship with that bewitching Nine-tail fox? It seems like this fellow was quite a player.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This girl can be considered as the direct descendant of the Devouring Master. Otherwise, it is impossible for her to possess Devouring Power.” Beside him, Yan softly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“His descendants can actually enjoy such blessings?” Lin Dong was a little startled. Since the Devouring Master possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, it was justifiable for him to possess Devouring Power. However, how was it possible for his descendants to enjoy it as well?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Once your cultivation reach the level of the Devouring Master and you achieve a perfect merger with the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, you will naturally possess such abilities as well. However, this is also an extremely rare occurrence. In fact, over the last tens of thousands of years, only a handful of his descendants possessed Devouring Power.” Yan explained.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong sighed in relief after hearing this. So, there was only a small possibility. Things were still alright in that case. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be as though everyone in the Kunpeng tribe was in possession of a Devouring Ancestral Symbol?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Little fellow, don’t tell me that you believe that I said those words previously merely because Kun Ling is my descendant?” The Devouring Master turned his attention and asked, while Lin Dong was softly speaking to Yan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong coughed dryly.

Previously, this fellow even wanted to make an attempt on Jiu Feng’s life.

Lin Dong, you should not bully Ling\u0027er. Although my descendants are able to gain some Devouring Power because of me, it is also precisely because of this that they will be suppressed when standing in front of the owner of the Devouring Ancestral Symbol.” The Devouring Master coughed softly and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong was stunned. He quickly turned to look at Kun Ling, who had grown angry because of embarrassment. Only then, did he come to a sudden comprehension. It’s no wonder this ice queen, who had only looked at him in an icy and indifferent manner on the outside, was suppressed by him upon entering this place.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, in that case, it was truly difficult to tell if it was a blessing or a curse for them to be in possession of Devouring Power.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It is true that Ling\u0027er is my descendant, but that is only part of the reason.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Devouring Master smiled faintly and said, “Most of my inheritance is regarding my understanding of Reincarnation.
