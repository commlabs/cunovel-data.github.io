She was looking for weather at the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me get you some breakfast,\" said Peter, after they had greeted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not for the world,\" she answered, lifting lids at a side table. \"I love breakfast. It\u0027s the only time when food seems to matter. I wouldn\u0027t think of letting anybody choose my breakfast.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There, at any rate, we agree,\" said Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you like breakfast, too?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s an Oxford habit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you haven\u0027t given up Oxford altogether?\" said Lady Mary, speaking as one who had heard something.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know all about me, like everybody else?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter groaned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course.

Everybody knows you were sent down from Gamaliel for being a Socialist.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not a Socialist,\" Peter hotly protested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary\u0027s eyes were full of mischief: \"You must have been sent down for being something.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m nothing at all,\" said Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you quite sure?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 195]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The silliest person alive is more than a label.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter cursed himself. He had again delivered an apothegm. Why must he always be so heavily serious? Lady Mary was openly smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re all going to be very silly at Highbury during the next few days. We\u0027ve simply got to label ourselves for Antony\u0027s sake.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tories,\" said Peter, trying to be nice, \"are exceptions.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean that Tories don\u0027t count?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I really don\u0027t mean that,\" said Peter, genuinely grieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I\u0027m afraid you don\u0027t mean anything at all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary was clearly amused. Peter miserably looked at her, looked at his plate, and then heard himself say:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why am I such a solemn ass?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who says that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say it myself,\" said Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary looked swiftly at his ingenuous face, in which exaggerated abasement struggled with a hope that she would reassure him. Her amusement was curiously shot with affection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You oughtn\u0027t to have told me this so soon,\" she said, smiling at him in the friendliest way. \"You see I don\u0027t yet know you well enough to contradict you. It would be rude.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me get you another sausage,\" said Peter, feeling a little better.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he brought her the food he saw her more[Pg 196] familiarly. Last night in her amazing dress she had seemed fragile and elaborate—all woman and social creature. But this morning he saw just a friendly girl, plainly suited in brown tweed, accessible and soothing. Now he really saw what she was like. He discreetly admired her hair and expressive eyes, her slender features and delicate complexion. She spoke on a clear note, level and quiet, suggesting that her ideas and feelings were regular and securely in leash. The music of her voice was vibrant but very sure. It declared a perfect balance, the voice of a woman who would not suffer to appear in any of her personal tones or gestures anything which could not beautifully be expressed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this point Marbury came into the room. Peter was bringing Lady Mary her sausage with the grave intentness of someone specially elected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hullo, Mary. Hullo, Peter. You seem to be eating well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Lady Mary. \"This is my third sausage.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What does Peter say?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve at last met someone who takes breakfast seriously.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I take everything seriously,\" said Peter, returning into gloom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You needn\u0027t be so unhappy about it,\" said Marbury. \"One good thing about an election is that it makes one realise the importance of being[Pg 197] earnest. Even the local paper becomes an immensely serious thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marbury settled to his breakfast, shook out the Highbury Gazette, and was absorbed. Soon he was smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it, Tony?\" asked Lady Mary, eating an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Listen to this,\" said Marbury. \"It\u0027s one of Jordan\u0027s speeches.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s Jordan?\" Peter interrupted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My opponent,\" said Marbury. \"He seems to be dangerous. He knows how to appeal to the people. He has just bought a house and some acres in the constituency, and he tells the Yorkshiremen that he\u0027s a farmer, with a stake in the county.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 he says, according to this report, \u0027you may perhaps be inclined to ask what this Mr. Jordan, a town-bred man and a stranger, knows about the land and the people on the land. Well, gentlemen, I\u0027m a farmer myself—in a small way. (Cheers.) I have a hundred or so acres of good Yorkshire soil. (Cheers.) I have twenty head of cattle, some sheep and poultry, and only this morning I was admiring three fine stacks of hay built by the honest labour of your fellow townsmen. (Loud Cheers.) Gentlemen, I have come to live among you. (A great outburst of cheering, many of the audience rising and waving their hats.)\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 198]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is this what you call politics from within?\" Peter scornfully interrupted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Peter, don\u0027t despise the amusements of the people. They like to be governed in this way. I shall have to see the bailiff.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m passing the home-farm,\" said Lady Mary. \"I\u0027ll send him to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she had gone, Marbury looked with amusement at Peter, chafing up and down the hearth-rug.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Peter,\" he said, \"compose yourself. The others will be coming down to breakfast.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why do you want the bailiff?\" Peter curtly inquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m thinking out a little light banter for Jordan. I want to know whether we can do better than twenty head of cattle and three fine stacks of hay.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suggest,\" said Peter, massively sarcastic, \"that you make out a list of your hens and pigs and send it round the constituency.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marbury considered this. \"That, Peter, is an idea. I\u0027ll talk it over with the agent.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter flung up his hands in the gesture Marbury loved in him and always knew how to provoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all damn nonsense,\" said Peter shortly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jordan calls it democracy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Politics!\" Peter exclaimed, with his nose in the air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve told you before, Peter, not to despise politics. It\u0027s ignorant. We\u0027ll go into the garden.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 199]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They walked on the terrace and found Haversham in the portable hut where he usually spent the day. He had been ordered by the doctors to live out of doors. Here he wrote letters, interviewed his tenants, and ordered the affairs of his estate and fortune. He was seldom alone, unless he wished it, for his friends treasured every moment they were able to spend with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter and Marbury paused at the open side of the hut, turned, as always, towards the sun. Marbury, before they reached Lord Haversham, had time to tell Peter that his uncle did not like his health to be talked about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is the programme?\" Haversham asked as they came up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eight meetings to-day, Uncle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Haversham tapped the paper he was holding:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve seen Jordan\u0027s latest?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We were talking about it,\" said Marbury.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you going to do?\" asked Haversham.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Peter suggests we should post the constituency with a schedule of your stock on the home-farm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter glowered at Marbury, but a moment after felt amiably foolish under Haversham\u0027s kind inspection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t expect me to believe that, Tony,\" said Haversham. \"But, seriously, don\u0027t let your agent do anything of the kind.

If you were a Radical like Jordan you could tell them you owned the whole constituency. In a Radical it would show good faith and a likeliness to look after local interests. But in a Tory it is bribery and coercion. Your leaflet would be published in the London Radical papers—Another Instance of Tory Intimidation.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You see, Peter,\" said Marbury, \"we shall have to be tactful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why notice the speech at all?\" asked Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because we are electioneering,\" said Marbury. \"We\u0027re not here for fun. My enemy has sent out a leaflet: \u0027Vote for Jordan, the farmer, and the farmer\u0027s friend\u0027—the implication, of course, being that I am neither a farmer nor a farmer\u0027s friend. It\u0027s much more important in an agricultural constituency to destroy this delicate suggestion than to prove that there is an absolute need for a Navy Bill next session of over sixty millions.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" objected Peter, \"but the whole thing is so ridiculous.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Haversham sighed: \"That\u0027s what makes public life so hard. It is especially hard for our people. There\u0027s nothing we dread more than losing touch with our sense of humour. But these sacrifices are necessary. These sixty millions have to be raised, and only Antony will raise them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You see, Peter,\" Marbury interposed, \"the sense of duty is not yet extinct. Please look less[Pg 201] incredulous. Then we\u0027ll go and talk to the farmers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why do you take me?\" Peter grunted. \"Why not take someone who really understands?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have set my mind on taking you,\" said Marbury finally. \"But you must be less critical. You will hear me say some obvious things. Please understand that I am quite honestly accepting a public duty, and don\u0027t look as if you were infinitely wiser and better, because you are not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter felt the sincerity of this appeal. He turned impulsively to Haversham.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Antony\"—Peter used the name with shy pleasure—\"has a way of putting me in the wrong.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Haversham smiled: \"I\u0027m sure you are excellent for one another,\" he said. \"It does Antony good to realise that he is elderly for his years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A servant came from the house and announced that the bailiff was waiting for Marbury. Peter was left for a time with his host, who drew him to talk easily of the days at Gamaliel and in town. Peter tried to explain how in suburban London he had failed to realise his hopes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps,\" Haversham suggested, \"you put the intellectual average too high?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It wasn\u0027t that,\" said Peter eagerly. \"I hope I haven\u0027t seemed too clever or anything of that kind. But somehow I was never comfortable. The more intelligence I found, the less I liked it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 202]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You felt, in fact, rather like a modern statesman measuring the results of popular education. He realises that he has educated the crowd just enough to be taken in by a smart electioneer. Happily there is wisdom still in Sandhaven. Our people will vote for Antony because they like him. They know he feels rightly about things. Jordan\u0027s cleverness doesn\u0027t appeal to them. He doesn\u0027t know the difference between a swede and a turnip.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then the seat is safe?\" concluded Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Haversham smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not altogether,\" he said. \"I got in last election by five hundred. There are some miners in the west corner, and there is a harbour at Sandhaven. The Government Whip has obscurely implied that votes for Jordan will be votes for the harbour. The harbour badly wants doing up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But that is corruption.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m afraid not,\" corrected Haversham. \"It is politics.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marbury joined them from the house, telling Peter to be ready for a rush over the moors. In half an hour they started alone, provided for the day. The meetings were appointed in small villages near Sandhaven, where they would spend the night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ordered luxury of Highbury gave to their plunge into the wilderness a keener pleasure. Peter was free to enjoy the spacious loveliness of the moors—to enjoy it at ease in the best possible[Pg 203] way. The contours of the country here were gradual and vast, but the speed at which they ran defeated monotony. The line of the greater banks shifted perpetually as they flew. Their colour came and went, changing at every mile the palette of the spread gorse and heather. Peter\u0027s joy was complete when from a high point of the moors he discovered the sea alive with the sun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The meetings began at noon with an informal handshaking of farmers in a tiny market-town not far from Sandhaven. They continued through the day in schoolhouses, lamplit as darkness fell, and they ended at Sandhaven in an orthodox demonstration, with a chairman and a union Jack and the local committee importantly throned on a large platform. Except at this final meeting Marbury talked quite simply to the electors. Already he knew the majority of them personally. He was aware of their circumstances, family history, the troubles of their farming, their prejudices and characters. He knew the local jokes—who had made rather a better bargain with his horse than the purchaser, who, under feminine pressure, had lately turned from chapel to church. Peter marvelled through the day at the prodigious industry implied in Marbury\u0027s knowledge, confessed to be yet imperfect, of the estate to which he was succeeding. Peter admired, too, the perfection of Marbury\u0027s manner. He never condescended. Nor was he familiar in the way of a candidate seeking to be popular. He talked with his own[Pg 204] people, in whom he was interested, for whom he had a right to care. Neither in himself nor in his tenants to be was there any of that uneasy pride of place which spoils a community whose members are busily asserting their rank. Marbury behaved, without self-consciousness, as part of a traditional system. He was met in the same way by men as yet untouched with the snobbery of labour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only at Sandhaven, where there was a strong opposition, did Marbury adopt the political or platform manner. Here he was called upon to explain to his audience why he considered that a personal landlord was better for agriculture than the local council. To Peter this seemed ludicrously unnecessary after what he had seen that day in the villages.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Towards the close of the meeting in Sandhaven, when questions were being asked, Peter, from the platform, saw Marbury\u0027s agent speak to a member of the audience. Marbury saw it too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He realises I\u0027ve shirked Jordan, the farmer\u0027s friend,\" he whispered to Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man whom the agent had prompted now rose and addressed Marbury:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will Lord Marbury tell us what title Mr. Jordan has to call himself the farmer\u0027s friend?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marbury rose, and picked a cutting of Jordan\u0027s speech from the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He read aloud the passages Peter had heard at breakfast, and deftly played with them. Peter admired the ease with which Mr. Jordan\u0027s [Pg 205]pretensions as a farmer were justly measured without any assumption in Marbury of superiority or rural snobbisme. His speech was pointed throughout with hearty laughter and cheers. It effectually countered the speech of his opponent, but it gave no handle anywhere for a charge that Marbury desired to use his position as an argument for his return.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Peter,\" said Marbury, as they were leaving the platform, \"you will hear that speech of mine forty times, in forty moods and tenses, during the next ten days. Please don\u0027t imagine that I enjoy it. But you saw the agent. He would not let me escape, even for twenty-four hours. He knows how important it is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Over a late supper at the hotel, Peter shared with Marbury his impressions of the day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Frankly,\" he said, \"I admired you most of the time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beginning to think better of politics?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Politics don\u0027t seem to count much in this election.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Platform politics don\u0027t. The people here are only just discovering them. I hear, by the way, that the Government Whips have arranged a debauch for next week. They\u0027re sending down Wenderby. My agent, who despises me, is frightened.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your agent ought to be jolly well pleased with you,\" said Peter indignantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is not,\" Marbury asserted. \"He thinks[Pg 206] I\u0027m too refined. He wants me to tell the people I\u0027m going to inherit seventy thousand acres. He tells me not to cut marble with a razor. He wants it coarse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They slept at Sandhaven, working back to Highbury on the following day. It was comparatively an easy journey, and they were back at Highbury in time for dinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter drifted shyly towards Lady Mary, and again was next to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is lucky,\" she said as they sat down. \"You can tell me about Antony\u0027s meetings.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know the difference between a bad meeting and a good one,\" said Peter. \"But Antony was pleased.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you been speaking?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What could I say?\" objected Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Antony tells me you are quite an orator.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But this is different,\" Peter pleaded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why is it different?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you see, I can talk when I really believe in things and have a lot to say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you believe in Antony?\" asked Lady Mary. She was determined not to let him off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" Peter admitted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then why not talk about him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what about politics?\" Peter objected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Haven\u0027t you any politics?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They all seem to be going,\" said Peter [Pg 207]dismally. \"Things aren\u0027t so simple as I thought.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One thing is simple enough,\" said Lady Mary, looking serenely at Peter. \"Antony is a better man for Sandhaven than Mr. Jordan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sure he is,\" Peter gladly agreed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well then.
