I saw no one but him. He\u0027d revealed himself for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing Edward, he would die for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence,\" Elise snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, everyone complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need the blood of a live werewolf in human form right now.\" She lifted her hand out of the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers held a full syringe. \"I already have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops,\" Damien murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Edward shoved the gun into Damien\u0027s ear. \"Oops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it outside,\" Elise ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I struggled, again to no avail. \"Don\u0027t hurt him. He\u0027s not what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the fanged and furry?\" Jessie asked. \"What exactly does werewolf mean, Leigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is what they all say,\" Edward murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you tell us what you\u0027re talking about?\" This was Will, a voice of reason always. Despite his Forrest Gump manner, he was starting to grow on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The brown wolf,\" I blurted. \"The one that was killing the others but not eating them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\" Jessie asked Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to nod, but it was a little hard with a gun in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Him,\" I confirmed. \"He\u0027s been helping us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s been helping Hector.\" Jessie drew her weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t know about the legend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie rolled her eyes. \"Are you that naive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body stiffened as if I\u0027d been hit with a cattle prod. Every muscle, every joint, tightened in agony. My eyes bugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the moon, felt its sheen on my skin like a caress. Then it was gone, and I lay there panting, aching, bleeding, but there was no blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to inject this before the first change,\" Elise said. \"Upsetting her is only making that happen more quickly. Perhaps we could let him live until I\u0027m done here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, whatever.\" Jessie put up her gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward?\" Elise murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s gaze flicked toward her, then away. \"I will not shoot him. Unless he makes me. But I will not put away my weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed the gun from Damien\u0027s ear - barely. With Edward, that was the best I could hope for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fit, or whatever it had been, passed. I was covered with sweat. My skin seemed too small, the hair on my arms too big. My scalp tingled, as did the base of my spine. Hell, I was probably sprouting a tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on with it,\" I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise stuck me. Frowning, she depressed the syringe and shot every last drop into my vein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the needle out, pressed a cotton pad to the prick, lifted it, scowled. \"No blood,\" she murmured. \"The wound healed already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that good or bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah, I was the guinea pig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for... something. What I got was nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stared at me. I stared back. We waited for what seemed like forever but was probably only an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel, Leigh?\" Elise asked for the fifth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any strange visions, odd pains?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay with her,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Edward stated, gun still pointed at Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she hasn\u0027t changed by morning, the serum works. There\u0027s no reason for all of us to stay here. Don\u0027t you have something to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glanced at Damien. \"Why, yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I said. \"If the serum works, we can use it on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien blinked. His eyes met mine; something flickered in the gray-green depths. I think it was hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s right,\" Elise murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward scowled, but he lowered his gun. \"Do not make me come after you. You will not like what happens then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving Leigh. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the serum does not work, I will kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the serum doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027ll let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world receded, but at least I didn\u0027t smell the forest, hear the trees, feel the wind. I didn\u0027t taste blood; I didn\u0027t even want to. I had to sleep. But before I did, just in case I never woke up, I wanted one last kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt by the bed. His fingertips brushed my hand. I turned my face, and his mouth was there. How had he known what I wanted without my saying a word?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss was gentle, sweet, everything I could ask for in a final embrace. His tongue tasted of mint -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efresh and clean, new. He nibbled my lower lip, rubbed his thumb along my cheekbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverse Sleeping Beauty complex,\" Jessie muttered. \"His kiss puts her to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell into the satin darkness with a smile on my face as his breath mingled with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tunnel or maybe a cave. Dark, not a flicker of light to stay away from - or perhaps run to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the darkness was peaceful. There was no one there but me. No Jimmy, no family, but the best part\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... no Hector. I went down that tunnel gladly and fell off the edge of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next instant, or so it seemed, I jerked awake. I was alone, and the gray light of dawn shivered on the horizon. I looked down. I was still me. No fangs, no fur. It was a good day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft footfall drew my attention to the door. Damien stood in the entryway, barefoot, tousled, his chin shadowed, skin pale. For an instant I wondered what had happened to the good doctor; then I realized I didn\u0027t care. Damien was here. He was the only one I wanted to see right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you sleep?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna come to bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened. His mouth opened, then shut. He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Untie me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh - \" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it, Damien. I won\u0027t bite.\" I let a slow smile spread across my face. \"Unless you want me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the room, stood over the bed, staring down at me. Suddenly I was embarrassed. Wanting him at a time like this - what was the matter with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to untie me,\" I muttered. \"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can. I think we\u0027ve proved that quite a few times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ve never...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was having a helluva time articulating this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to say that we\u0027ve never been together when I knew what you were and I knew that you knew what I was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a half-laugh. \"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think I want us to be together now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his eyes. There was that hope again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d awoken this morning a human being. No tail, no snout, no savage bloodlust. Maybe, one day, Damien would, too. And if he could, then we might have a future. All I had to do was kill the demon who wanted to mate with me beneath the full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy life - what can I say? - it wasn\u0027t for sissies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I repeated. \"Because I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t planned to say that. What if I had to shoot him? But what if he died - what if I did - before I told him the truth? At least Jimmy had known how I felt and he\u0027d died without discovering how I\u0027d betrayed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed away the thought. I needed to let the past go and focus on the future. I\u0027d been close to death and worse last night. Every day from now on was a gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwelling on what I\u0027d done, punishing myself with it, was getting me nowhere. I needed to live or get out of the game. With Damien in my life, I knew which one I would choose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt by the bed. His clever fingers released the knots. My hands went around his neck and pulled him close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me again,\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lips met and I forgot everything but him. There was no one, nothing, else. No werewolves, no demons, no power eaters. Just Damien and me - until Edward walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my tongue down Damien\u0027s throat; he had his hand up my shirt. A gasp from the doorway made us freeze. I glanced past Damien\u0027s shoulder and met the shocked eyes of the man who\u0027d saved, then given me back, my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have lost your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien yanked his hand out of my shirt and tried to pull away. I held on, kissed his cheek, smoothed his hair, then let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" Standing, I crossed the room and stopped right in front of Edward. \"But it\u0027s my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see now why you didn\u0027t want him dead.\" He shook his head. \"I thought better of you, Leigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolves are...\" He seemed to struggle for the words. \"Accomplished at the physical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that your way of saying they\u0027re great in the sack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced. \"If you must. They are carnal creatures. Their senses are heightened. They have lived long enough to learn many things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Damien. He shrugged. What could he say? He knew how to make me scream. Let\u0027s shoot him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have warned you of their allure. But I thought after Hector you would understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave Hector out of this. They\u0027re nothing alike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? Did they not both seduce you while in human form? Hector killed everyone you ever loved in order to have you. How do you know this animal will not do the same?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe excuse sounded lame, even to my own ears. Edward actually laughed in my face. \"If you needed a boyfriend, why not pick one with the same interests as you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. He\u0027s been killing werewolves for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve seen. Tell him, Damien. Tell him what you told me about the magic woman in Arkansas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stopped laughing. His faded blue eyes sharpened. \"What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly Damien told him his story. I give Edward credit: he listened. He no longer laughed, so I pressed the advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was with you last night. Did he kill anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them exchanged glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward cleared his throat. \"You\u0027ve been asleep longer than one night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hunter\u0027s moon is tonight,\" Damien told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let that sink in. Well, at least I wouldn\u0027t have to wait around to find out if my life was over or just begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at Edward. \"That just makes my point stronger. What true werewolf could hold back from killing this close to a full moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is true,\" Edward murmured. \"I\u0027d hoped he would lose his patience so I could - \" He broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder you were so agreeable. You thought he\u0027d be unable to resist all that tender meat. Then you could kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shrugged, unrepentant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he did not.\" Edward stared at Damien as if he were a bug under a microscope. \"Maybe what has happened to him could be of help to Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. If you don\u0027t shoot him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. He lives. For now. But please refrain from sucking face around me. It makes me ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sucking face?\" Damien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hears things on television.\" I shrugged. \"He\u0027s still lost in the forties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hit me then that Edward and Damien were compatriots. They would be of an age if Damien hadn\u0027t become a werewolf. Still, I doubted they\u0027d embrace and become best friends - even if Elise\u0027s serum was a success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will Elise test the cure on Damien?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When she returns from the lab with more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"She\u0027s gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as she knew you were all right, she left for Montana to make more serum and...\" He hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are some other issues she must deal with at headquarters. She will return after the hunter\u0027s moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps pounded outside. Jessie and Will spilled into the room. \"We figured out how to get Hector,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s glasses were crooked, his hair all mussed. It appeared that he and Jessie had been sucking face, too. \"He doesn\u0027t know about the serum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light dawned. \"He thinks I\u0027ll change. He\u0027ll be coming after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Leigh,\" Damien said. \"He\u0027s dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes met his. \"He\u0027ll be coming after you, too. You\u0027re the sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes met. We had to do this together if we wanted any kind of future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien took my hand. He\u0027d be right next to me tonight. Suddenly I felt as if I could accomplish anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubted the feeling would last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d think we\u0027d have all sorts of preparations to make, but since we were basically going to let Hector get away with it, our business was to wait. Not my strong suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot go out and about today, Leigh,\" Edward warned. \"Hector could be anywhere. He could be anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we wanted him to snatch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do not want him to know you have been cured. What would you do if you had been bitten, then changed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides that?\" Jessie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How should I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone glanced toward Damien, who shrugged. \"You wouldn\u0027t kill yourself, Leigh. Not once you\u0027d changed. Then you\u0027d be different. You\u0027d no longer be like you; you\u0027d be like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwell. \"What did you do? That first time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Went mad in the woods. Munched on Nazis. A few Allies, too. It was a werewolf buffet over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The good old days,\" Jessie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot her a warning glare. Damien was trying to help us. She needed to let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in the war?\" Edward glanced in my direction. Why he couldn\u0027t just ask Damien the question I have no idea. Except he wasn\u0027t used to conversing with werewolves - only killing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was bitten after the invasion,\" I explained. \"He was a soldier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitten by one of Mengele\u0027s wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed. He still felt guilty that he\u0027d been unable to prevent the release of the monsters in the Black Forest. He\u0027d dedicated his life to righting what he considered his greatest wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned my attention to Damien. \"What did you do in the days after you\u0027d shifted the first time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slept. The physical changes take some getting used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleeping sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I\u0027d slept most of the night, I was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will sleep,\" Edward ordered. \"The rest of us will watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean watch you sleep. I meant watch this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think Hector will be watching us, too? Or one of his wolf boys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how to watch a residence, Leigh. I am not completely senile. Yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a thought - one I should have had before, but I\u0027d been a little busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Cora have any fascinating ideas on how to kill Hector?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie and Will shook their heads. \"Nothing more than what she told us the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an idea,\" Will said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad someone does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often doing the opposite of a ritual will reverse the outcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"English, Slick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked and adjusted his glasses. \"I thought that was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea what he was talking about?\" Jessie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the ritual is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he blushing? I kind of thought so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ritual is doing me under the hunter\u0027s moon in front of all the other wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So not doing you will keep him from becoming all-powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That works well for me. But how do we kill the son of a bitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He became a Weendigo by killing, then eating the flesh of his enemy. Reverse it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what he\u0027d said. \"His enemy kills, then eats him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it could. Because Hector\u0027s enemy was me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-37.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
