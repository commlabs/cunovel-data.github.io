I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess. It\u0027s satisfying when you can keep hammering away at something until it starts to make sense. But not everything does.\" We were on dessert now, some kind of gooey honey cake, too sweet for me to finish. The waitress had brought us Moroccan coffee, which was the same idea as Turkish coffee, very thick and bitter, with powdery grounds filling the bottom third of the cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I put in a good day\u0027s work. That\u0027s satisfying. But I\u0027m working on the wrong case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you work on two things at once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably, but nobody\u0027s paying me to investigate a snuff film. I\u0027m supposed to be determining whether or not Richard Thurman killed his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I? Thursday night I went to the fights, with the excuse that he was producing the telecast. I established several things. I established that he\u0027s the kind of guy who will take off his tie and jacket when he\u0027s working. And he\u0027s spry, he can climb up onto the ring apron and then drop down again without breaking a sweat. I got to watch him give the placard girl a pat on the ass, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was something for him. I don\u0027t know that it was anything much for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? It says something if he can play grab-ass with a tootsie two months after his wife\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two and a half months,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tootsie, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tootsie, a floozie, a bimbo. What\u0027s wrong with tootsie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. He wasn\u0027t exactly playing grab-ass. He just gave her a pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In front of millions of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They should be so lucky. A couple hundred people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus the audience at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were watching a commercial. Anyway, what would it prove? That he\u0027s a coldhearted son of a bitch who puts his hands on other women while his wife\u0027s body has barely had time to settle in the grave? Or that he doesn\u0027t have to put on an act because he\u0027s genuinely innocent? You could see it either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Thursday. Yesterday, relentless fellow that I am, I drank a glass of club soda in the same gin joint with him. It was a little like being at opposite ends of a crowded subway car, but we were both actually in the same room at the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And last night I had dinner at Radicchio\u0027s, on the ground floor of his apartment building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing special. The pasta was pretty good. We\u0027ll try it sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he in the restaurant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even think he was in the building. If he was home he was sitting in the dark. You know, I called his apartment this morning. I was making all those other calls so I called him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he have to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got his machine. I didn\u0027t leave a message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope he\u0027ll find that as frustrating as I always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One can only hope. You know what I ought to do? I ought to give Lyman Warriner his money back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? I can\u0027t keep it if I don\u0027t do anything to earn it, and I can\u0027t seem to think of a way to do that. I read the file the cops built on the case, and they already tried everything I could think of and more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t return the money,\" she said. \"Honey, he doesn\u0027t give a damn about the money. His sister got killed and if he thinks he\u0027s doing something about it he\u0027ll have a chance to die in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I supposed to do, string him along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he asks, tell him these things take time. You won\u0027t be asking him for more money-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- so he\u0027ll have no reason to think that you\u0027re hustling him. You don\u0027t have to keep the money, if you don\u0027t feel you\u0027ve done anything to earn it. Give it away. Give it to AIDS research, give it to God\u0027s Love We Deliver, there are plenty of places to give it to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing you,\" she said, \"you\u0027ll find a way to earn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE was a movie she wanted to see at the Waverly but it was Saturday night and there was a long line that neither of us felt like standing in. We walked around for a while, had some cappuccino on Macdougal Street, and listened to a girl folksinger in a no-cover club on Bleecker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long hair and granny glasses,\" Elaine said. \"And a long gingham gown. Who said the sixties were over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All her songs sound the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she only knows three chords.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside I asked her if she felt like listening to some jazz. She said, \"Sure, where? Sweet Basil? The Vanguard? Pick a place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking maybe Mother Goose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I like Mother Goose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you want to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Do we get to stay even if Danny Boy\u0027s not there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDANNY Boy wasn\u0027t there, but we hadn\u0027t been there long before he showed up. Mother Goose is at Amsterdam and Eighty-first, a jazz club that draws a salt-and-pepper crowd. They keep the lights low, and the drummer uses brushes and never takes a solo. It and Poogan\u0027s Pub are the two places where you can find Danny Boy Bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever you find him, he tends to stand out. He\u0027s an albino Negro, his skin and eyes both extremely sensitive to sunlight, and he has arranged his life so he and the sun are never up at the same time. He is a small man who dresses with flair, favoring dark suits and flamboyant vests. He drinks a lot of Russian vodka, straight up and ice-cold, and he often has a woman with him, usually every bit as flashy as his vest. The one tonight had a mane of strawberry blond hair and absolutely enormous breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ma–ætre d\u0027 led them to the ringside table where he always sits. I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d noticed us, but at the end of the set a waiter appeared at our table and said that Mr. Bell hoped we would join him. When we got there Danny Boy said, \"Matthew, Elaine, it\u0027s so nice to see you both. This is Sascha, isn\u0027t she darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSascha giggled. We made conversation, and after a few minutes Sascha sashayed off to the ladies\u0027 room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To powder her nose,\" Danny Boy said. \"As it were. The best argument for legalizing drugs is people wouldn\u0027t keep running to the lavatory all the time. When they figure out the man-hours cocaine is costing American industry, they really ought to factor in those rest-room trips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until Sascha\u0027s next trip to the ladies\u0027 room to bring up Richard Thurman. \"I sort of assumed he killed her,\" Danny Boy said. \"She was rich and he wasn\u0027t. If only the fellow was a doctor I\u0027d say there was no doubt at all. Why do you suppose doctors are always killing their wives? Do they tend to marry bitches? How would you explain it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kicked it around some. I said maybe they were used to playing God, making life-and-death decisions. Elaine had a more elaborate theory. She said people who went into the healing professions were frequently individuals who were trying to overcome a perception of themselves as hurting people. \"They become doctors to prove they\u0027re not killers,\" she said, \"and then when they experience stress they revert to what they think of as their basic nature, and they kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting,\" Danny Boy said. \"Why would they have that perception in the first place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A birth thought,\" she said. \"The mother almost dies when they\u0027re born, or experiences a great deal of pain. So the child\u0027s thought is I hurt women or I kill women. He tries to compensate for this by becoming a doctor, and later on when push comes to shove-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He kills his wife,\" Danny Boy said. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked what data she had to support the theory, and she said she didn\u0027t have any, but there were lots of studies on the effects of birth thoughts. Danny Boy said he didn\u0027t care about data, you could find data to prove anything, but the theory was the first one he\u0027d ever heard that made sense to him, so screw the data. Sascha had returned to the table during the discussion but it went on without interruption, and she didn\u0027t seem to be paying any attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About Thurman,\" Danny Boy said. \"I haven\u0027t heard anything specific. I haven\u0027t listened all that hard. Should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be good to keep an ear open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poured himself a few ounces of Stoly. At both of his places, Poogan\u0027s and Mother Goose, they bring him his vodka in a champagne bucket packed with ice. He looked down into the glass, then drank it down like water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"He\u0027s with a cable channel. A new sports channel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five Borough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. There\u0027s some talk going around about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing very specific. Something shaky or shady about it, some dubious money backing it. I\u0027ll see what else I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later Sascha left the table again. When she was out of earshot Elaine leaned forward and said, \"I can\u0027t stand it. That child has the biggest tits I\u0027ve ever seen in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny Boy, they\u0027re bigger than your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. She\u0027s special, isn\u0027t she? But I think I\u0027m going to have to give her up.\" He poured himself another drink. \"I can\u0027t afford her,\" he said. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe what it costs to keep that little nose happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoy her while you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I shall,\" he said. \"Like life itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBACK in her apartment, Elaine made a pot of coffee and we sat on the couch. She stacked some solo piano recordings on the turntable- Monk, Randy Weston, Cedar Walton. She said, \"She was something, wasn\u0027t she? Sascha. I don\u0027t know where Danny Boy finds them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"K Mart,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you see something like that you have to figure silicone, but maybe they\u0027re like Topsy, maybe they just growed. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t really notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you better start going to more meetings, because it must have been the vodka that was making you drool.\" She drew closer to me. \"What do you think? Would you like me better if I had huge tits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Longer legs would be nice, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a fact? What about trimmer ankles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Tell me more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut it out,\" I said. \"That tickles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it really? Tell me what else you\u0027ve got on your wish list. How about a tight pussy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be too much to hope for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, boy,\" she said. \"You\u0027re really asking for it, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I hope so,\" she said. \"I certainly hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAFTERWARD I lay in her bed while she turned the stack of records and brought back two cups of coffee. We sat up in bed and didn\u0027t say much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while she said, \"You were pissed yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was? When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you had to get out of here because I had somebody coming over.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-16.html","bookId":2327,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM"}
