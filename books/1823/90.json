But some days I miss him so much I can’t breathe. I miss the fun I had with him. I miss making love to him. I miss missing him. He used to work so many hours that when he would walk in the front door at night I would rush across the room and jump in his arms because I missed him so much. I even miss how much he loved it when I would do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the not-so-strong days when I wish my mother knew about everything that was going on. I sometimes just want to drive over to her house and curl up on the couch with her while she tucks my hair behind my ear and tells me it’ll all be okay. Sometimes even grown women need their mother’s comfort so we can just take a break from having to be strong all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in my car, parked in her driveway, for a good five minutes before I work up the strength to go inside. It sucks that I have to do this because I know that in a way, I’ll be breaking her heart, too. I hate it when she’s sad and telling her I married a man who might be like my father is going to make her really sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walk through the front door, she’s in the kitchen layering noodles in a pan. I don’t remove my coat right away for obvious reasons. I’m not wearing a maternity shirt but my bump is almost impossible to hide without a jacket. Especially from a mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, sweetie!” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into the kitchen and give her a side hug while she layers cheese over the top of the lasagna. Once the lasagna is in the oven, we walk over to the dining room table and take a seat. She leans back in her chair and takes a sip from a glass of tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s smiling. I hate it even more that she looks so happy right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lily,” she says. “There’s something I need to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t like this. I was coming over here to talk to her. I’m not prepared to receive a talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” I ask hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grips her glass of tea with both hands. “I’m seeing someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth drops open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” I ask, shaking my head. “That’s . . .” I’m about to say good, but then I grow instantly worried that she’s just put herself in a similar situation she was in with my father. She can see the worry on my face, so she grabs my hands in both of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s good, Lily. He’s so good. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief washes over me in an instant, because I can see she’s telling the truth. I can see the happiness in her eyes. “Wow,” I say, not expecting this at all. “I’m happy for you. When can I meet him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tonight, if you want,” she says. “I can invite him over to eat with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “No,” I whisper. “Now’s not a good time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands squeeze around mine as soon as she realizes I’m here to tell her something important. I start with the better part of the news first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up and remove my jacket. At first, she doesn’t think anything of it. She just assumes I’m making myself comfortable. But then I take one of her hands and I press it against my stomach. “You’re gonna be a grandma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widen and for several seconds, she’s stunned speechless. But then tears begin to form. She jumps up and pulls me into a hug. “Lily!” she says. “Oh my God!” She pulls back, smiling. “That was so fast. Were you trying? You haven’t even been married for very long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “No. It was a shock. Believe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and after another hug, we both sit down again. I try to keep up my smile, but it’s not the smile of an elated expectant mother. She sees that almost immediately. She slides a hand over her mouth. “Sweetie,” she whispers. “What’s the matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil this moment, I’ve fought to remain strong. I’ve fought to not feel too sorry for myself when I’m around other people. But sitting here with my mother, I crave weakness. I just want to be able to give up for a little while. I want her to take over and hug me and tell me it’ll all be okay. And for the next fifteen minutes while I cry in her arms, that’s exactly what happens. I just stop fighting for myself because I need someone else to do it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spare her most of the details of our relationship, but I do tell her the most important things. That he’s hurt me on more than one occasion, and I don’t know what to do. That I’m scared to have this baby alone. That I’m scared I might make the wrong decision. That I’m scared I’m being too weak and that I should have had him arrested. That I’m scared I’m being too sensitive and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. Basically, I tell her everything I haven’t even been brave enough to fully admit to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe retrieves some napkins out of the kitchen and comes back to the table. After our eyes are finally dry, she begins to crumple the napkin up between her hands, rolling it over in circles as she stares down at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to take him back?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say yes. But I also don’t say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the first moment since this has happened that I’m being completely honest. I’m honest to her and to myself. Maybe because she’s the only one I know who has been through this. She’s the only one I know who would understand the massive amounts of confusion I’ve been experiencing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, but I also shrug. “Most of me feels like I’ll never be able to trust him again. But a huge part of me grieves what I had with him. We were so good together, Mom. The times I spent with him were some of the best moments of my life. And occasionally I feel like maybe I don’t want to give that up.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-ends-with-us/page-90.html","bookId":1823,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:27 PM"}
