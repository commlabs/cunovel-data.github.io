RELIEVED","content":"\u0026nbsp;Well waited is well done. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here—hi!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This time some one heard him, and that small, silent man, Ben Abdi, stood in the doorway of the tent at attention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you keeping a good look-out down the valley?” asked Major Agar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ee yess, sar.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No signs of any one?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sar.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Agar shut up the diary, which book Ben Abdi had been taught to regard as strictly official, laid it aside, and passed out of the tent, the little Goorkha following close upon his heels with a quick intelligent interest in his every movement which somehow suggested a dusky and faithful little dog.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For some moments they stood thus on the edge of the small plateau, the big man in front, the little one behind—alert, with twinkling, beady eyes. Behind them towered a bleak grey slope of bare rock, like a cliff set back at a slight angle, so treeless, so smooth was the face of it. In front the great blue-shadowed valley lay beneath them, stretching away to the south, until in a distant haze the sharp hills seemed to close in and cut it short.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Perched thus, as it were, upon the roof of the world, these two men looked down upon it all with a calm sense of possession, and to him of the dominant race standing there some thousands of miles from his native land—alone—master of this great stretch of an alien shore, there must have come some passing thought of the strangeness of it all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was something wrong—he knew that. His orders had been to press forward and occupy this little ridge, which was vaguely marked on the service maps as Mistley\u0027s Plateau, named after an adventurous soul, its discoverer. He had been instructed to hold this against all comers, and if possible to prevent communication between the two valleys, connected only by this narrow pass. All this Agar had carried out to the letter; but some one else had failed somewhere.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It will be three days at the most,” his chief had said, “and the main body of the advance guard will join you!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jem Agar had been in occupation a week, and it seemed that he and his little band of men were forgotten of the world. Still this soldier held on, saying nothing to his men, writing his intensely practical diary, and trusting as a soldier should to the Deus ex machina who finally allows discipline to triumph. He looked down into the valley, piercing the shimmer of its hazes with his gentle blue eyes, looking to his chief, who had said, “In three days I will join you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not the first time that Agar and the little non-commissioned native officer, Ben Abdi, had stood thus together. They had taken their stand in this same spot in the keen air of the early morning, with the white frost crystallising the stones around them; in the glow of midday; and when the moon, hanging over the sharp-pointed hills, cast the valley into an opaque shade dark and fathomless as the valley of death.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Scanning the distant hills, Agar presently raised his eyes, noting the position of the sun in the heavens.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you tried the heliograph a second time this morning?” he asked without looking round, which informality of manner warmed the little soldier\u0027s heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sar. Three times since breakfast.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was the first time that Ben Abdi had found himself in a position of some responsibility, in immediate touch with one of the white-skinned warriors from over seas whose methods of making war had for him all the mystery and the infinite possibilities of a religion. This silent looking out for relief partook in some small degree of the nature of a council of war. Jem Sahib and himself were undoubtedly the chiefs of this expeditionary force, and to whom else than himself, Ben Abdi, should the Major turn for counsel and assistance? The little Goorkha preferred, however, that it should be thus; that Agar Sahib should say nothing, merely allowing him to stand silent three paces behind. He was a modest little man, this Goorkha, and knew the limit of his own capabilities, which knowledge, by the way, is not always to be found in the hearts of some of us boasting a fairer skin. He knew that for hard fighting, snugly concealed behind a rock at two hundred yards, or in the open, with cunning bayonet or swinging kookery, he was as good as his fellows; but for strategy, for the larger responsibilities of warfare, he was well pleased that his superior officer should manage these affairs in his quiet way unaided.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n During a luncheon more remarkable for heartiness of despatch than delicacy of viand, James Edward Makerstone Agar devoted much thought to the affairs of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of India. After luncheon he lighted a cheroot, threw himself on his bed, and there reflected further. Then he called to him Ben Abdi.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No more promiscuous shooting,” he said to him. “No more volley firing at a single Ghilzai or a stray Bhutari. It seems that they do not know we are here, as we are left undisturbed. I do not want them to know—understand? If you see any one going along the valley, send two men after him; no shooting, Ben Abdi.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he pointed with his cheroot towards the evil-looking curved knife which hung at the Goorkha\u0027s side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben Abdi grinned. He understood that sort of business thoroughly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then followed many technical instructions—not only technical in good honest English, but interlarded with words from a language which cannot be written with our alphabet for the benefit of such as love details of a realistic nature.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The result of this council was that sundry little dusky warriors were busy clambering about the rocky slope all that day and well into the short hill-country evening, working in twos and threes with the alacrity of ants.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jem Agar, in his own good time, was proceeding to further fortify, as well as circumstances allowed, the position he had been told to hold until relief should come. In addition to the magic of the master\u0027s eye he lent the assistance of his strong right arm, laying his lithe weight against many a rock which his men could not move unaided. By the evening the position was in a fairly fortified state, and, after a copious dinner in the chill breeze that rushed from the mountain down to the valley after sunset, he walked placidly up and down at the edge of the plateau, watching, ever watching, but with calmness and no sign of anxiety.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such it is to be an Englishman—the product of an English public school and country life. Thick-limbed, very quiet; thick-headed if you will!—that is as may be—but with a nerve of iron, ready to face the last foe of all—Death, without so much as a wink.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To his ear came at times the low cautious cry of some night-bird sailing with heavy wing down to the haunt of mouse or mole; otherwise the night was still as only mountain night-seasons are. Far down below him, the jungle and forest were rustling with game and beasts of prey seeking their meat from God, but the larger beasts of India, unlike their African brethren, move in silence, stealthy yet courageous; and the distance was too great for the quickly stifled cry of the victim of panther or tiger to reach him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the moon rose he made the round of his pickets—a matter of ten minutes—and then to bed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the morning of the ninth day he thought he detected signs of uneasiness in the faces of the men. He found their keen little visages ever turned towards him, watching his every movement, noting the play of every feature. So in his simplicity he practised a simple diplomacy. He hummed to himself as he went his rounds and while he sat over his diary. He only knew one song—“A Warrior Bold”—which every mess in India associated with old Jem Agar, for no evening was considered complete without the Major\u0027s one ditty if he were present. He had stood up and roared it in many strange places, quite without sentiment, without self-consciousness, without afterthought. He never thought it a matter of apology that he should have failed to learn another song. The smile with which many ladies of his acquaintance sat down to play the accompaniment by heart conveyed nothing to him. He did not pretend to be a singer—he knew that one song, and if they liked it he would sing it. Moreover, they did like it, and that was why they asked for it. It did some of them good to see honest Jem get on his legs and shout out, in a very musical voice, with perfect truth to air, what seemed to be a plain statement of his creed of life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So, far up on Mistley Plateau, nine thousand feet above the level of the sea, Jem Agar advised his little dark-visaged fighters, sotto voce, while he puzzled over his diary, that his love had golden hair, with eyes so blue and heart so true, that none with her compared; moreover, that he didn\u0027t care if death were nigh, because he had fought for love, and for love would die.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not very deep or very subtle, but it served the purpose. It kept up the hearts of his handful of warriors, who, in common with their chief, had something child-like and simple in their honest, sporting souls.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shortly after tiffin Ben Abdi came to the Major\u0027s tent, speaking hurriedly in his own tongue.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One of the men had seen the sunlight gleam on white steel far down in the valley. He had seen it several times—a long spiral flash, such as the sun would make on a fixed bayonet carried over the shoulder. Such a flash as this will carry twenty miles through a clear atmosphere; the spot pointed out by the sharp-eyed Goorkha was not more than ten miles distant. They stood in a group, this isolated little band, and gazed down into the depth below them. They gazed in vain for some time, then a little murmur of excitement told that the sun had glinted again on burnished steel. This time there were several flashes close together. These were men marching with fixed bayonets through an enemy\u0027s country.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Heliograph,” said Agar quietly, without taking his eyes from the spot far down in the valley; and soon the little mirror was flashing out its question over the vale. After a few anxious moments the answering gleam sprang to life among the trees far below. Agar gave a quick little sigh of relief—that was all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then followed a short conversation flickered over ten miles of space.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you beset?” asked the Valley,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” replied the Hill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is the enemy in sight?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” replied the Mountain, again, with a sharp click.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you all well?” flashed from below.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” from above.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the “Good-bye,” and the glimmer of the bayonets began again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Two hours later Major Agar drew his absurd little force in line, and thus they received the relieving column, grimly conscious of dangers past but not forgotten.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the head of the new-comers rode a little man with a prominent chin and a long drooping nose; such a remarkable-looking little man that the veriest tyro at physiognomy would have turned to look at him again. His black eyes, beaming with intelligence, moved so quickly beneath the steady lashes that it was next to an impossibility to state what he saw and what he failed to see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He returned Agar\u0027s salute hurriedly, with a preoccupied air. He wore a quiet uniform tunic almost hidden by black braiding, a pith helmet which had seen brighter days and likewise fouler, and the leg that he threw over his horse\u0027s head was cased in riding trousers and a neat little top-boot of brown leather.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He slipped from the saddle with a litheness which contrasted strangely with his closely cropped grey hair and white moustache and Imperial. He walked towards Agar\u0027s tent after the manner of one who had sat in the saddle for many hours. His spurs clanked with a sharp, business-like ring, and his every movement had that neat finish which indicates the soldier born and bred.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wheeling round he faced Agar, who had followed him with a more leisurely gait based on longer legs, looking up keenly into the quiet fair face. Turning he shot his sword home into its scabbard with a click.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank God,” he said, “you\u0027re safe!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Agar awaited for further observations. This was not the man whom he had expected, but another, far greater, far higher up in the military scale—a man whom he had only met once before, and that at an official reception.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seeing that his guest was unbuckling his sword, he presumed that the task of continuing this conversation lay with himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “M\u0027 yes!” he replied, rubbing his pannikin out clean with the corner of a towel, and proceeding to mix some brandy and water; “why?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why!” answered the little man scornfully, “WHY! damn it, sir, Stevenor\u0027s command has been cut off by the enemy in force—massacred to a man. That is why I say \u0027Thank God, you\u0027re safe!\u0027 It is more than I expected.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2871/79427.html","bookId":1177,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:27:13 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:27:13 AM"}
