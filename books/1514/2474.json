Both of them clearly practiced the same profound martial art. From the looks of it, they seemed to be competing with each other in terms of this martial art. However, there was indeed quite a big gap in the Yuan Power cultivation of the two. It was obvious that Liu Qing held the absolute upper hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough the green dragon light tattoos raged, the three hundred purplish gold dragon tattoos firmly entrenched themselves around Lin Dong.

A huge gully was formed as the mountain below collapsed, causing the entire mountain to be split into two at this moment.

A solemness flashed across his eyes, but he did not show any signs of dodging. This Liu Qing was clearly attempting to probe his understanding of the Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill.

Liu Qing was indeed much stronger than the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander, Liu Tao and other ordinary Samsara stage individuals. If it was not because Lin Dong’s Mental Energy had advanced into the initial Symbol Grandmaster level, it was likely that he would be no match for Liu Qing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter stabilizing his body, Lin Dong lifted his head and looked at Liu Qing, who had not budged at all.

There were far too many competitors now. One more Liu Qing really did not matter.

She did not say anything unnecessary. Instead, a silver-white light flashed in her eyes and a unique ripple directly shot towards Lin Dong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Mental Energy?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s eyes hardened when this ripple appeared. With a flick of his finger, equally sharp silver-white Mental Energy whizzed out and directly shattered the ripple from the lady.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNo loud sound appeared when the two powerful Mental Energies clashed.

Astonishment also flitted across the icy face of the red clothed silver hair lady. Soon after, her eyes looked deeply at Lin Dong. Evidently, she had also sensed that Lin Dong’s Mental Energy was not inferior to her own.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ha ha, looks like this little friend walks the same path as that lass, Kun Ling.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe clash of Mental Energy might be faint, but it should also be known just what kind of people were present. Naturally, the secret exchange between the two did not escape their perception. Immediately, first elder Kun Yuan laughed and looked at Lin Dong in a meaningful manner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Girl, you have finally met a rival.

This old fellow really had ill intentions.

As expected, a burning aura had rose within the latter’s ice-cold eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Friend, we can spar with Mental Energy if you have the time.” The lady called Kun Ling might appear ice-cold, but it seemed that she greatly minded that Lin Dong was able to match her in terms of Mental Energy at such a young age. Hence, she quickly opened her mouth and spoke. Her voice might be gentle and pleasant to the ears, but it caused Lin Dong to bitterly laugh in his heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“We will talk about it when there is time.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong helplessly shook his head as he half-heartedly responded. He was currently busy with obtaining the inheritance of the Devouring Master.

After which, he changed the topic. His eyes looked towards the Celestial Gale infested depths of the barren plains and said, “The wind will weaken tomorrow. At that time, we should start heading into the depths of the barren plains and find that shattered space.

It was likely that almost half of the experts from the Demon Region had congregated here. The four overlord tribes, eight king tribes and other renown great factions within the Demon Region had dispatched their top experts to this place. Looks like there will be an extremely intense competition for the Devouring Master’s inheritance…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s hands tightly clenched at this point.

Thus, he could only shake his head. He did not know why, but there was a slight unease deep within his heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1160\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1162\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1161","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
