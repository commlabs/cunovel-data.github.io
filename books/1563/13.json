Harry wished he could forget what he\u0027d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\u0027t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\u0027t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\u0027d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u0027t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\u0027s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u0027d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\u0027s exactly the sort of thing that\u0027ll lose us the match! Snape\u0027s refereeing this time, and he\u0027ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snape\u0027s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\u0027s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\u0027s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\u0027ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\u0027t got an excuse to pick on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen -- \" He caught sight of Harry\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter with you? You look terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\u0027s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play,\" said Hermione at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say you\u0027re ill,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\u0027t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\u0027t play at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u0027s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\u0027s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he\u0027d been looking for someone to practice that on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want more trouble,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\u0027s used to walking all over people, but that\u0027s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need to tell me I\u0027m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\u0027s already done that,\" Neville choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\u0027t it? And where\u0027s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville\u0027s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Harry... I think I\u0027ll go to bed... D\u0027you want the card, you collect them, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\u0027ve found Flamel! I told you I\u0027d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: \u0027Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u0027s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u0027t looked so excited since they\u0027d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\u0027 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light ?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\u0027d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she found what she was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it! I knew it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis didn\u0027t have quite the effect she\u0027d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honestly, don\u0027t you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel\u0027s Sorcerer\u0027s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\u0027re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\u0027s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape\u0027s after it! Anyone would want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no wonder we couldn\u0027t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\u0027s not exactly recent if he\u0027s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\u0027d do with a Sorcerer\u0027s Stone if they had one. It wasn\u0027t until Ron said he\u0027d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\u0027t, all the Slytherins will think I\u0027m just too scared to face Snape. I\u0027ll show them... it\u0027ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as long as we\u0027re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\u0027t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry didn\u0027t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\u0027d found out about the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone? Harry didn\u0027t see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\u0027d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u0027t what you\u0027d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u0027s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\u0027t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\u0027d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, don\u0027t forget, it\u0027s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\u0027t nag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\u0027s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole school\u0027s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore\u0027s come to watch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s heart did a somersault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look -- they\u0027re off. Ouch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u0027t see you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder how long Potter\u0027s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon didn\u0027t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It\u0027s people they feel sorry for. See, there\u0027s Potter, who\u0027s got no parents, then there\u0027s the Weasleys, who\u0027ve got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\u0027ve got no brains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\u0027d be poorer than Weasley, and that\u0027s saying something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon\u0027s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u0027s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn\u0027t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\u0027s over! Harry\u0027s won! We\u0027ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\u0027t believe it. He\u0027d done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\u0027s smiling face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven\u0027t been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\u0027t ever remember feeling happier. He\u0027d really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\u0027d done it, he\u0027d shown Snape...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of Snape...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\u0027s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\u0027s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees were so thick he couldn\u0027t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\u0027t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u0027t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... d-don\u0027t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I thought we\u0027d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy. \"Students aren\u0027t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\u0027s yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-b-but Severus, I--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I don\u0027t know what you--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \" -- your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\u0027m waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-but I d-d-don\u0027t--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\u0027ll have another little chat soon, when you\u0027ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, where have you been ?\" Hermione squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\u0027s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he\u0027ll be all right -- talk about showing Slytherin! I\u0027ve waiting for you in the common room, we\u0027re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\u0027s find an empty room, you wait \u0027til you hear this...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made sure Peeves wasn\u0027t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\u0027d seen and heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\u0027s Stone, and Snape\u0027s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy -- and he said something about Quirrell\u0027s \u0027hocus pocus\u0027 -- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you mean the Stone\u0027s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-harry-potter-1/page-13.html","bookId":1563,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM"}
