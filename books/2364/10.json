In 1976 there was a successful Israeli raid on Entebbe, and Mao Zedong died, and James Earl Carter, Jr., was elected President of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara erected another office building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1977 Charlie Chaplin died, and Elvis Presley temporarily died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara built the largest shopping mall in Chicago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1978 Reverend Jim Jones and 911 followers committed mass suicide in Guyana. The United States recognized Communist China, and the Panama Canal treaties were ratified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara built a series of high-rise condominiums in Rogers Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1979 Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty at Camp David, there was a nuclear accident at Three-Mile Island, and Muslim fundamentalists seized the United States Embassy in Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara built a skyscraper and a glamorous resort and country club in Deerfield, north of Chicago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara seldom went out socially, and when she did, she usually went to a club where jazz was played. She liked Andy\u0027s, a club where the top jazz artists performed. She listened to Von Freeman, the great saxophonist, and Eric Schneider, and reed man Anthony Braxton, and Art Hodes at the piano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara had no time to feel lonely. She spent every day with her family: the architects and the construction crew, the carpenters, the electricians and surveyors and plumbers. She was obsessed with the building she was putting up. Her stage was Chicago, and she was the star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer professional life was proceeding beyond her wildest dreams, but she had no personal life. Her experience with Sean MacAllister had soured her on sexual relationships, and she never met anyone she was interested in seeing for more than an evening or two. In the back of Lara\u0027s mind was an elusive image, someone she had once met and wanted to meet again. But she could never seem to capture it. For a fleeting moment she would recall it, and then it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were plenty of suitors. They ranged from business executives to oilmen to poets, and even included some of her employees. Lara was pleasant to all of the men, but she never permitted any relationship to go further than a good-night handshake at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Lara found herself attracted to Pete Ryan, the head foreman on one of Lara\u0027s building jobs, a handsome, strapping young man with an Irish brogue and a quick smile, and Lara started visiting the project Ryan was working on more and more often. They would talk about construction problems, but underneath they were both aware that they were speaking about other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to have dinner with me?\" Ryan asked. The word \"dinner\" was stretched out slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara felt her heart give a little jump. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan picked Lara up at her apartment, but they never got to dinner. \"My God, you\u0027re a lovely thing,\" he said. And his strong arms went around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was ready for him. Their foreplay had been going on for months. Ryan picked her up and carried her into the bedroom. They undressed together, quickly, urgently. He had a lean, hard build, and Lara had a quick mental picture of Sean MacAllister\u0027s heavy, pudgy body. The next moment she was in bed and Ryan was on top of her, his hands and tongue all over her, and she cried aloud with the joy of what was happening to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were both spent, they lay in each other\u0027s arms. \"My God,\" Ryan said softly, \"you\u0027re a bloody miracle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you,\" Lara whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not remember when she had been so happy. Ryan was everything she wanted. He was intelligent and warm, and they understood each other, they spoke the same language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan squeezed her hand. \"I\u0027m starved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I. I\u0027ll make us some sandwiches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow night,\" Ryan promised, \"I\u0027ll take you out for a proper dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara held him close. \"It\u0027s a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Lara went to visit Ryan at the building site. She could see him high up on one of the steel girders, giving orders to his men. As Lara walked toward the work elevator, one of the workmen grinned at her. \"Mornin\u0027, Miss Cameron.\" There was an odd note in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother workman passed her and grinned. \"Mornin\u0027, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo other workmen were leering at her. \"Morning, boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara looked around. Other workmen were watching her, all smirking. Lara\u0027s face turned red. She stepped into the work elevator and rode up to the level where Ryan was. As she stepped out, Ryan saw her and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, sweetheart,\" Ryan said. \"What time is dinner tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll starve first,\" Lara said fiercely. \"You\u0027re fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery building Lara put up was a challenge. She erected small office buildings with floor spaces of five thousand square feet, and large office buildings and hotels. But no matter what type of building it was, the most important thing to her was the location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill Rogers had been right. Location, location, location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s empire kept expanding. She was beginning to get recognition from the city fathers and from the press and the public. She was a glamorous figure, and when she went to charity events or to the opera or a museum, photographers were always eager to take her picture. She began to appear in the media more and more often. All her buildings were successes, and still she was not satisfied. It was as though she were waiting for something wonderful to happen to her, waiting for a door to open, waiting to be touched by some unknown magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was puzzled. \"What do you want, Lara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was all he could get out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day Lara said to Keller, \"Howard, do you know how much we\u0027re paying every month for janitors and linen service and window washers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes with the territory,\" Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s buy the territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to start a subsidiary. We\u0027ll supply those services to ourselves and to other builders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea was a success from the beginning. The profits kept pouring in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to Keller that Lara had built an emotional wall around herself. He was closer to her than anyone else, and yet Lara never spoke to him about her family or her background. It was as though she had emerged full blown out of the mists of nowhere. In the beginning Keller had been Lara\u0027s mentor, teaching her and guiding her, but now Lara made all the decisions alone. The pupil had outgrown the teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara let nothing stand in her way. She was becoming an irresistible force, and there was no stopping her. She was a perfectionist. She knew what she wanted and insisted on getting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first some of the workmen tried to take advantage of her. They had never worked for a woman before, and the idea amused them. They were in for a shock. When Lara caught one of the foremen pencil-whipping - signing off for work that had not been done - she called him in front of the crew and fired him. She was at the building site every morning. The crew would arrive at six o\u0027clock and find Lara already there, waiting for them. There was rampant sexism. The men would wait until Lara was in earshot and exchange lewd jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear about the talking pussy at the farm? It fell in love with a cock and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the little girl said, \u0027Can you get pregnant swallowing a man\u0027s seed?\u0027 And her mama said, \u0027No. From that, darling, you get jewelry...\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some overt gestures. Occasionally one of the workmen passing Lara would \"accidentally\" brush his arm across her breasts or press against her bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops, sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Lara said. \"Pick up your check and get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir amusement eventually began to change to respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, when Lara was driving along Kedzie Avenue with Howard Keller, she came to a block filled with small shops. She stopped the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This block is being wasted,\" Lara said. \"There should be a high rise here. These little shops can\u0027t bring much of an income.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but the problem is, you\u0027d have to persuade every one of these tenants to sell out,\" Keller said. \"Some of them may not want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can buy them out,\" Lara declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara, if even one tenant refuses to sell, you could be stuck for a bundle. You\u0027ll have bought a lot of little shops you don\u0027t want and you won\u0027t be able to put up your building. And if the tenants get wind that a big high rise is going up here, they\u0027ll hold you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t let them know what we\u0027re doing,\" Lara said. She was beginning to get excited. \"We\u0027ll have different people approach the owners of the shops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been through this before,\" Keller warned. \"If word leaks out, they\u0027re going to gouge you for every penny they can get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll have to be careful. Let\u0027s get an option on the property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe block on Kedzie Avenue consisted of more than a dozen small stores and shops. There was a bakery, a hardware store, a barbershop, a clothing store, a butcher, a tailor, a drugstore, a stationery store, a coffee shop, and a variety of other businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t forget the risk,\" Keller warned Lara. \"If there\u0027s one holdout, you\u0027ve lost all the money you\u0027ve put in to buy those businesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Lara said. \"I\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week later a stranger walked into the two-chair barbershop. The barber was reading a magazine. As the door opened, he looked up and nodded. \"Can I help you, sir? Haircut?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger smiled. \"No,\" he said. \"I just arrived in town. I had a barbershop in New Jersey, but my wife wanted to move here to be near her mother. I\u0027m looking for a shop I can buy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the only barbershop in the neighborhood,\" the barber said. \"It\u0027s not for sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger smiled. \"When you come right down to it, everything\u0027s for sale, isn\u0027t it? At the right price, of course. What\u0027s this shop worth - about fifty, sixty thousand dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" the barber admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really am anxious to have my own shop again. I\u0027ll tell you what. I\u0027ll give you seventy-five thousand dollars for this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I couldn\u0027t think of selling it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, mister, I don\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can take all the equipment with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barber was staring at him. \"You\u0027ll give me a hundred thousand and let me take the barber chairs and the rest of the equipment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I have my own equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I think about it? I\u0027ll have to talk to my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ll drop back tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later the barbershop was acquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one down,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bakery was next. It was a small family bakery owned by a husband and wife. The ovens in the back room permeated the store with the smell of fresh bread. A woman was talking to one of the owners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband died and left me his insurance money. We had a bakery in Florida. I\u0027ve been looking for a place just like this. I\u0027d like to buy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a comfortable living,\" the owner said. \"My wife and I have never thought about selling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were interested in selling, how much would you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owner shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you say the bakery\u0027s worth sixty thousand dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, at least seventy-five,\" the owner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" the woman said. \"I\u0027ll give you a hundred thousand dollars for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owner stared at her. \"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been more serious in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning Lara said, \"That\u0027s two down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the deals went just as smoothly. They had a dozen men and women going around impersonating tailors, bakers, pharmacists, and butchers. Over the period of the next six months Lara bought out the stores, then hired people to come in and run the different operations. The architects had already started to draw up plans for the high rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was studying the latest reports. \"It looks like we\u0027ve done it,\" she told Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we have a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? The only one left is the coffee shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s our problem. He\u0027s there on a five-year lease, but he won\u0027t give up the lease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Offer him more money...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says he won\u0027t give it up at any price.\" Lara was staring at him. \"Does he know about the high rise going up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027ll go talk to him. Don\u0027t worry, he\u0027ll get out. Find out who owns the building he\u0027s in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Lara paid a visit to the site. Haley\u0027s Coffee Shop was at the far end of the southwest corner of the block. The shop was small, with half a dozen stools along the counter and four booths. A man Lara presumed to be the proprietor was behind the counter. He appeared to be in his late sixties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sat down at a booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning,\" the man said pleasantly. \"What can I bring you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orange juice and coffee, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him squeeze some fresh orange juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My waitress didn\u0027t show up today. Good help\u0027s hard to get these days.\" He poured the coffee and came from behind the counter. He was in a wheelchair. He had no legs. Lara watched silently as he brought the coffee and orange juice to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Lara said. She looked around. \"Nice place you have here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever think of retiring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"You\u0027re the second person who asked me that this week. No, I\u0027ll never retire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they didn\u0027t offer you enough money,\" Lara suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has nothing to do with money, miss. Before I came here, I spent two years in a veterans hospital. No friends. Not much point to life. And then someone talked me into leasing this place.\" He smiled. \"It changed my whole life. All the people in the neighborhood drop in here. They\u0027ve become my friends, almost like my family. It\u0027s given me a reason for living.\" He shook his head. \"No. Money has nothing to do with it. Can I bring you more coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was in a meeting with Howard Keller and the architect. \"We don\u0027t even have to buy out his lease,\" Keller was saying. \"I just talked to the landlord. There\u0027s a forfeiture clause if the coffee shop doesn\u0027t gross a certain amount each month. For the last few months he\u0027s been under that gross, so we can close him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara turned to the architect. \"I have a question for you.\" She looked down at the plans spread out on the table and pointed to the southwest corner of the drawing. \"What if we built a setback here, eliminated this little area and let the coffee shop stay? Could the building still be put up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe architect studied the plan. \"I suppose so. I could slope that side of the building and counterbalance it on the other side. Of course, it would look better if we didn\u0027t have to do that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it could work,\" Lara pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller said, \"Lara, I told you we can force him out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara shook her head. \"We\u0027ve bought up the rest of the block, haven\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller nodded. \"You bet. You\u0027re the proud owner of a clothing store, a tailor shop, a stationery store, a drugstore, a bakery, a...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Lara said. \"The tenants of the new high rise are going to have a coffee shop to drop in on. And so do we. Haley stays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn her father\u0027s birthday Lara said to Keller, \"Howard, I want you to do me a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to go to Scotland for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to build something in Scotland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to buy a castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a place in the Highlands called Loch Morlich. It\u0027s on the road to Glenmore near Aviemore. There are castles all around there. Buy one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of a summer home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t plan to live in it.
