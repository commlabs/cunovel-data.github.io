In the skies, endless waves of pale golden thunder still danced in the air, lingering on, a memory of that electric sword strike that seemed as if it could split apart the dome of heaven.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone felt as if they were lost in a dream, waking up with nothing but hints of purple light and shadow within their pupils.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Sword of Judgment, he actually did it…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Shibai had already expected this, he still felt it to be unbelievable. In just two months, both the Sword of Judgment and the Thunder Battleform, the two unique martial skills that the Eightfall Thunder Emperor had relied on to walk unrivalled within the world, had actually been learnt by Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis could no longer be described with just the word ‘talent’.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but there was no hitch in Lin Ming’s control of these two unique skills. He was able to perfectly utilize the Concept of Thunder, skillfully manipulating the power of life and the power of death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming had Situ Yaoyue’s cultivation, then even a Divine Sea Supreme Elder would perish under his hands.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnfortunately, he was only at the peak of the first stage of Life Destruction, and the result of this was that he was being tightly suppressed by Situ Yaoyue. In that Cage of Darkness that was able to hinder speed, Lin Ming’s velocity had plummeted. Every movement, every action he took required over double the normal amount of true essence. If he was unable to break through this cage, then it was only a matter of time until he was defeated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the Cage of Darkness, Situ Yaoyue had already turned into a wisp of black smoke. Her so-called ‘slow’ speed was only in comparison to a beast like Lin Ming. When compared to a normal Life Destruction martial artist, her movements were simply untraceable like a ghost!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Lanjian, I want to see just how you’ll break my Cage of Darkness! Go die!” Situ Yaoyue circled behind Lin Ming and stabbed out her long spear. Because she had the advantage of speed, Situ Yaoyue didn’t have to use any fierce martial skills. Her superiority was that with Lin Ming’s current speed being weighed down, it was impossible for him to block her fast moves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming flew backwards, his protective true essence surging around him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue chased him.

Although she was currently sacrificing striking power for attack speed, every spear strike of hers was still equal to the all-out attack of a top 100 ranked Destiny Decree master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven so, Lin Ming only had a minor flesh wound after receiving such a strike, as if his entire body was forged from profound metal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who cares how great your defensive power is, let’s see just how many spear strikes you can take!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue rushed out once more, clearly wanting to use her superiority in speed to defeat Lin Ming. This method of fighting didn’t seem honorable, but any winning tactic was a good tactic.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Concept of Darkness can actually be used like this! Situ Yaoyue is truly a genius!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA martial artist commented. He had an understanding of the Concept of Darkness, but that had only stopped at the Laws of Devouring; he hadn’t even heard about the second level Concept of slowing space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It isn’t just Lin Lanjian, but even if it were someone like Situ Yaoyue, who has a dantian variation, or if it were some monstrous genius with an inborn divine body or divine bloodline, they would also perish if caught in this Cage of Darkness!” To the martial artists present, the formidable and awe-inspiring majesty of a divine body, divine blood, or dantian variation had already been deeply rooted in their psyches. Thus, they used them as an example.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA blood red spear light stretched into a rainbow. This was Situ Yaoyue’s third spear strike. Just as she was stabbing towards lin Ming’s throat, a feeling of impending danger burst within her mind!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘This is bad!’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue’s beautiful face paled. Just as her spear was thrust halfway, she forcefully retrieved it and stormed backwards. However, it was already too late!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuddenly, a resonant and glorious phoenix cry resounded from within Lin Ming’s body. The Ancient Phoenix mark between his eyebrows began to blaze with a fiery gold divine light. That golden light turned into a brilliant rainbow, seeming as if it had turned into countless golden swords that pierced the heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, Lin Ming had completely burnt all of the Ancient Phoenix blood within himself!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt that moment, all of the Divine Sea powerhouses present felt a formidable pressure pushing down on them, as if a true God Beast had descended upon the world. All of them revealed a trace of surprise. Even the normally calm Yang Yun revealed an expression of amazement.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYang Yun was stricken. This feeling was…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e100 drops of Ancient Phoenix blood combusted within him, forcibly summoning the majesty of the Ancient Phoenix God Beast that dwelled within his body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBefore reaching the Revolving Core realm, Lin Ming had often used the ability of burning the Ancient Phoenix blood within him. However, ever since he returned from Timeworn Phoenix City where he had absorbed 100 drops of Ancient Phoenix blood, this was his first time thoroughly burning it all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNormally, a martial artist would burn their blood essence in exchange for a far higher combat strength. However, once that blood essence was burned it would disappear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the blood of the Ancient Phoenix was different.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Ancient Phoenix was a God Beast of the heavens and earth, an existence that possessed an immortal body. Its bloodline was also the same. It could bathe within the hot fires of nirvana and be reborn. Thus, even if its blood was combusted, it would not reduce in the least.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had 100 drops of Ancient Phoenix blood within his body. If he completely burnt all of this then it could release a terrifying energy. Before Lin Ming had attained the body of a Life Destruction powerhouse, this massive amount of energy could have easily scorched his meridians. But now, after every cell within his body had been tempered and transformed by energy, his entire body could transmit energy without needing to pass it through his meridians. This was one of the greatest benefits of Life Destruction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith this, Lin Ming unscrupulously burnt all the Ancient Phoenix blood within his body. A vast and titanic power of fire erupted, and the strength of the Ancient Phoenix blood poured into Lin Ming’s bloodline, causing his blood to boil over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, Lin Ming’s entire body was lit aflame. The heaven-step Burning Star Flame howled as it rushed out, manifesting into a giant phoenix with a thousand foot wingspan that flew into the skies, directly impacting into the heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe conflagration of flames was monstrous, earth-shattering! All of the fire origin energy within a radius of several hundred miles was stirred up by this massive phoenix, completely rushing towards the center. A red storm covered the skies as if a crimson tsunami had appeared in the heavens, enveloping the world!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, space itself was scorched by the power of fire. A crimson sun seemed to slowly rise from within Lin Ming’s body, glorious and magnificent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s entire body was bathed in an inferno of flames. He bit down on the tip of his tongue. Then, the totem mark on the Heretical God Sprout that symbolized the Fire Source Laws suddenly emitted a flaming golden light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s blood fused into the Heretical God Sprout, and a small golden phoenix slowly budded out from the leaves of the Heretical God Sprout. The small phoenix slowly flapped its wings as it flew into the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis small phoenix was countless times smaller than the one formed by the Burning star Flame. However, it emitted a divine light that blinded all eyes, with a far more terrifying energy roiling within it. This was the power born from the fusion of Lin Ming’s blood essence and the Laws carved onto the Heretical God Sprout!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe small golden phoenix flew into the skies, melting into that red Burning Star Flame phoenix. As they touched, it was like a shining sun had suddenly appeared in the skies. The entire dimensional realm was completely covered in endless golden light, sparkling with a divine radiance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Break!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming coldly said as he flourished his spear. If this Cage of Darkness was immune to physical attacks, then he would use the burning light of source flames as his sword and cut away the darkness!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKree\u0026nbsp;- !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe golden red flame phoenix let out a keening cry.

She had thought Lin Ming was a thunder-attribute martial artist because of the various phenomena that occurred when he crossed Life Destruction. At that time, his entire body had been tempered by thunder, giving him affinity to Thunder Laws that no one could reach.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut she never imagined that his ability to control fire even far surpassed his ability to control thunder.
