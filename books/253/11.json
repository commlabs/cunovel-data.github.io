{"id":7676,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 3 Establishing Rapport","content":"Rapport is the establishment of common ground, of acomfort zone where two or more people can mentallyjoin together. When you have rapport, each of youbrings something to the interaction—attentiveness,warmth, a sense of humor, for example—and eachbrings something back: empathy, sympathy, maybe acouple of great jokes. Rapport is the lubricant thatallows social exchanges to flow smoothly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The prize, when you achieve rapport, is the otherperson\u0027s positive acceptance. This response won\u0027t be inso many words, but it will signal something like this:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know I just met you, but I like you so I will trust youwith my attention.\" Sometimes rapport just happens allby itself, as if by chance; sometimes you have to give it ahand. Get it right, and the communicating can begin. Getit wrong, and you\u0027ll have to bargain for attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As you meet and greet new people, your ability toestablish rapport will depend on four things: your attitude,your ability to \"synchronize\" certain aspects ofbehavior like body language and voice tone, your conversationskills and your ability to discover which sense(visual, auditory or kinesthetic) the other person relieson most. Once you become adept in these four areas,you will be able to quickly connect and establish rapportwith anyone you choose and at any time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 19Read on, and you\u0027ll discover that it\u0027s possible tospeed up the process of feeling comfortable with astranger by quantum-leaping the usual familiarizationrituals and going straight into the routines that peoplewho like each other do naturally. In virtually no time atall, you will be getting along as if you\u0027ve known eachother for ages. Many of my students report that whenachieving rapport becomes second nature, they findpeople asking, \"Are you sure we haven\u0027t met before?\"I know the feeling; it happens to me all the time. Andit\u0027s not just people asking me the question. 1 am convincedthat half the people I meet, I\u0027ve met before—that\u0027s the way it goes when you move easily into anotherperson\u0027s map of the world. It\u0027s a wonderful feeling.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28307.html","bookId":253,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:54:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:54:39 AM"}
