Was it because she was too emotionally involved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuh! Of course it was. She guessed she wasn\u0027t a very modern woman, after all. To say she was conflicted was an understatement. What was the matter with her? She didn\u0027t want or need a commitment from Liam. Maybe she just wanted the sex to have meant something to him and for him to tell her so. Obviously for him it had just been a couple of enjoyable hours getting rid of tension. He had probably already moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t get to sleep until almost two in the morning, but by then she had figured it all out. Liam had been an impulsive distraction from her goals, and she couldn\u0027t allow that to happen again. She had too many other things to concentrate on. When she wasn\u0027t working at the cyber unit, she wanted to focus on the program she had built-there was still a bit of tweaking that needed to be done. She couldn\u0027t let Liam mess with her head, and the only way to accomplish that was to stay away from him. Thank goodness he was going to make it easy for her. He was probably getting ready to get on a plane to God knew where even then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept until ten, then dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and sat cross-legged on the sofa with her laptop to catch up on her e-mails. It had been well over a week since she\u0027d last checked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrolling through the dozens of messages, some requiring responses, others nuisance promotions to be deleted, she found two reminders that Father Basher was being honored tonight for his service to the university at a cocktail party given by some of the alumni at the Hamilton Hotel. Only seniors, staff members, and a few close friends of the Jesuit professor were invited. There was also an invitation to a reception for him next week so that everyone at the college could say good-bye to him, and though attendance for both events wasn\u0027t mandatory, it was strongly encouraged that everyone attend. She made a note in her calendar about the second event. One simply didn\u0027t ignore the Jesuits. Besides, everyone admired Father Basher. He was one of the best in his field, and she hated to see him retire. He had taught her to love the Renaissance painters. After taking a required course from him, she had signed up to take another as an elective but had to wait three semesters for an opening. He was going to be sorely missed at the university, and she was happy to see he was being given the recognition he deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt twelve o\u0027clock Charlotte called. \"Sorry I didn\u0027t phone any sooner,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you sorry? I didn\u0027t expect you to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, drawn-out sigh let Allison know how frustrated her sister was. \"You didn\u0027t read your e-mails, did you?\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just checking them now. It\u0027s been a busy week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re always on your laptop. How could you not look at your e-mails?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison set her computer aside as she listened to her sister\u0027s complaints. When she unfolded her legs, an aching twinge shot down to her feet and she realized she had been sitting too long in one spot. She got up and stretched before heading to the kitchen. Charlotte was getting testy and obviously needed to vent. Allison let her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally interrupted her sister\u0027s lecture on communication. \"What\u0027s going on with you? Why are you so hyper?\" she asked as she rummaged through her cabinets for a snack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You\u0027re here? What are you doing in Boston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I told you that Oliver was attending a conference here. Don\u0027t you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she didn\u0027t remember, but she wasn\u0027t going to admit it and listen to another lecture. \"Sure, I do,\" she said instead. She found a potato chip bag with a few crumbs in the bottom and emptied them into her mouth before scrunching the bag and tossing it into the trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the last minute I got the time off and decided to come with him. Aren\u0027t you happy I\u0027m here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am. I\u0027m just surprised, that\u0027s all. I\u0027ve missed you,\" she said, and she meant it. \"Do you and Oliver want to stay with me? I\u0027ll take the sofa and you two can have my bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks,\" Charlotte answered. \"The law firm is putting us up at the Four Seasons. It\u0027s very fancy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay with you, then,\" Allison said, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just teasing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mind that we aren\u0027t staying with you, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m relieved. I\u0027d have to go to the grocery store and change my sheets.\" She opened the refrigerator door, peered inside, and moved the water bottles out of the way in search of something more substantial. She found a blueberry yogurt cup in the back and reached for it, checking the expiration date before opening the drawer for a spoon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-58.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
