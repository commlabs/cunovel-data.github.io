{"id":97383,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Doom That Came to Thalarion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarried on the shoulders of three Ter-men, Eldin was not unconscious when he was borne from Lathi\u0027s throne room. He could feel an egg rising on the back of his head, true, but that was only a temporary thing. He had come to his senses as soon as he was picked up, and now he was taking particular note of the route his bearers took through the paper-built maze to-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-To where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he to be simply disposed of, he wondered, or would it be a grandiose thing? Whichever, he wouldn\u0027t go quietly. But for the moment it were best that he lie still and firmly fix in his mind\u0027s eye the tortuous ways that led back to the throne room and his fellow adventurer, David Hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hero-hah\" thought Eldin, and he was almost tempted to snort. And the eidolon Lathi, luscious little plum, making eyes at the young idiot. Why, by now he was bound to be making eyes right back at her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Eldin had time to conjure more than two or three erotic pictures of Hero\u0027s present pursuits with the Queen of the hive, he was tossed rudely into the black throat of a deep, well-like pit. Some twenty feet down he struck bottom-a mercifully spongy bottom, though sprinkled here and there with hard bits-and lay still while he got his wind back. The place was lighted with the same fungous blue glow of the upper tunnels, which light was supplemented by the rather more rotten luminescence of-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecaying corpses!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEldin quickly scrambled away from a pile of stinking cadavers and miscellaneous bones, only to be drawn back a moment later as his curiosity got the better of him. The stench was terrible, and while his fall hadn\u0027t harmed him certainly this reeking atmosphere soon would. Gingerly, with his naked foot, he turned over skeletons and kicked aside leering skulls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was a veritable ossuary, a boneyard, and it was plain to see that Thalarion\u0027s Ter-men had no favorites when it came to unwanted visitors. No, for the bones and cadavers were of almost every sort and species of dreamland\u0027s denizens. There were the skulls and tattered loincloths of the tiny brown people of Kled, and the larger, big-boned corpses of rangy men of Inquanok. There were recently dead, softly-rounded remains of black men of Parg-doubtless escaped slaves from some galley on the Southern Sea-and even homed skulls of the evil, squat, wide-mouthed denizens of Leng\u0027s forbidden plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow they had come here and why-that was anybody\u0027s guess, but plainly they had all ended up the same way. Yes, and now it seemed that Eldin the Wanderer was to share a like fate. He was not ready to give in so easily, however, and so tried scaling the walls. But the stuff of the walls simply would not take his weight; it came down in handfuls whenever he got a good grip, so that it seemed if he continued he must surely bury himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, as he paused to think again, he felt a tremor in the pulpy, paper foundations of the place. He stood stock still and silent, waiting, and after a moment there came another subterranean shock. A small earthquake, perhaps? A series of them? Or had a couple of Thalarion\u0027s fretted spires rotted through and toppled down onto the city? Eldin hoped so, and also that a good many Ter-men had been crushed or smothered, but he doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still pondering the mystery when, a moment later, there echoed from on high the sounds of a struggle and a voice he had thought never to hear again. Shouting her defiance, gasping and crying all at the same time, Aminza was giving someone an awful lot of trouble up there. The sounds came closer, and with one last shriek of defiance Aminza was pitched down into the hole. Eldin, directly beneath her, was able to catch hold of her arms and so cushion her fall a little, but still they were both dashed down to the pulpy floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, quick as a flash, Aminza had elbowed him in the ribs, was up on her feet and had her back to the wall. Eyes blazing in the blue-glowing gloom, she cried: \"Come on then, whoever or whatever you are. Come and get your eyes scratched out!\" And she held up her hands before her, fingers crooked and ready to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn me, girl,\" Eldin wheezed, getting his breath back where he sat on a broken skull, \"I\u0027m not sure I want to marry you after all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eldin?\" she gasped. \"Eldin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, it\u0027s me all right,\" he said, climbing wearily to his feet and staggering as a third tremor set the whole city shaking. \"But what the devil\u0027s happening, girl? Are you in some way responsible for these shocks that keep rocking the place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me,\" she cried, flinging herself into his arms. \"I don\u0027t know what it is-but it feels like the city\u0027s about to fall down about our ears!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least we\u0027ll be together if it does,\" he answered. \"Now then, you\u0027d best tell me how you come to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathlessly she explained how from the heights of the Tree she had seen the dreamers taken prisoner, and how then she had slipped away from the Tree and followed the column of Ter-men to Thalarion. From the hills she had watched them enter the city, had then sneaked closer and crept inside. She bore no weapon with her, no plan of action in her head, but only knew that she must rescue her friends if that were at all possible. If not, then she would share their fate. A body of Ter-men had picked her up almost immediately and had obviously deemed it wisest not to take her to the eidolon Lathi. The Queen would not tolerate another whole female in her hive. Thus she had been dumped into the pit, there to starve and join the bones of them who went before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brave but foolish,\" Eldin growled, hugging her to him in the gloom. \"It seems the old Tree was right about us, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded her head against his chest in agreement and a little sob escaped her trembling lips. \"Oh, Eldin!\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be frightened, girl,\" he patted her abstractedly. \"Things will turn out all right-I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked about at the contents of the pit, staring hard as her eyes grew accustomed to the shadows, then once more buried her face in Eldin\u0027s chest. \"If only it wasn\u0027t so gloomy,\" she sobbed. Then-\"Eldinl\" she cried, and danced away from him in a sudden fever of excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh? What?\" he cried. \"What\u0027s up, lass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pouch!\" she answered. \"I\u0027ve brought your pouch. I\u0027d forgotten about it till now. Here-\" and digging a hand into her shirt she came out with Eldin\u0027s waterproof pouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took it from her, thumbed its contents through the outer skin and slowly shook his head. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking, girl, but forget it. If I struck a light down here, with all these rotten gases swirling about- whooshl-the place would go up like tinder, and us trapped in the middle of it. No, I can think of better ways to die. Here, put the pouch away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she took back the pouch the ground shook yet again, and this time the piled bones and mummies literally erupted in a cloud of decaying debris. Something groped upward from the floor, swayed in the bluish light, fell writhingly against the pair where they crouched beside the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the devil-7\" Eldin snarled, then relaxed with a great sigh of relief as a voice in his mind said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve found you-at last!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tree!\" cried Aminza, her hand on the shuddering root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of him, at least,\" said Eldin, and to the Tree: \"Was that you shaking the city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed. Did I not tell you that my roots had already discovered Thalarion, finding the soil beneath the city dry and dead? It offers them little or no resistance. I only hope I\u0027ve strength enough to complete my task-which is to bring demon-cursed Thalarion to the ground!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do more than that, old friend,\" cried Eldin out loud. \"But first-can you get us out of this pit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" answered the voice in his head as the root withdrew. A moment later it reappeared, bursting through the wall close to the very top of the pit. Down it snaked to where Eldin and Aminza could grasp it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Climb, climb!\" cried the Tree\u0027s voice in their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You first, lass,\" said Eldin, pushing her from behind. \"Up you go.\" To the Tree he said, \"How much damage do you think you can do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Eldin began to climb, the Tree answered. \"I can destroy Thalarion-though that will be the end of me. There are bound to be survivors, and I know what they\u0027ll do to me. At least I\u0027ll go in a blaze of glory!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very brave and very foolish,\" answered Eldin with a savage grin as he climbed out of the pit directly behind Aminza. \"Tree, what prompted you to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Hero were willing to give up your lives for me, and Aminza was willing to die for you. And so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re willing to bum in order to give us a chance, eh? But what if Thalarion has no survivors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just do your bit, old twig,\" grinned Eldin, \"and leave the rest to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else may I do to help you?\" asked the Tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can try to find Hero and see if he needs a helping hand-or root,\" the scarfaced dreamer answered. \"And you\u0027d best be on your way now so that I can get this thing started. How many of you-er, much of you-is there under the city anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of me,\" answered the Tree. \"And for now, farewell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe root withdrew, was gone in an instant, and now the two stood alone at the edge of the pit ... for a second only. For as the tremors began again, stronger now and more insistent, so a pair of Ter-men emerged at a run from the mouth of a nearby passageway. For a moment it looked as if they might go on their way, but then they saw Eldin and Aminza at the edge of the pit. They had scythes and lifted them up as they rushed upon the pair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout ceremony Eldin shoved Aminza to one side. He snatched at the first Ter-man\u0027s scythe arm, pulled, ducked and lifted all in one flowing motion, drawing his attacker up onto his brawny back. They were after all not used to fighting, these Ter-men, and Eldin held his victim across his shoulders in a wrestling hold as he spun, knocking his second assailant flying. Then, tossing the dizzy creature from his shoulders into the pit, he turned and kicked the second Ter-man in the throat as he made to get to his feet. With a gurgle that told of a smashed windpipe the Ter-man fell back. Eldin snatched up his fallen scythe, pounced on him and dispatched him with a single stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, lass,\" he grunted, turning to Aminza. \"Take this.\" She gingerly accepted the crescent blade, twisting her mouth at sight of the thin yellow fluid which served the Ter-men as blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No good going all squeamish now, Aminza,\" Eldin told her. \"There\u0027s some damned rough work ahead and I\u0027ve no doubt you\u0027ll need to do your bit. Now then, give me back my pouch, will you? I think we\u0027ll have a little more light on the scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tore fragments of paper from a wall, struck sparks from his firestones, tossed the makeshift brand into the pit behind him. With a rush and a roar that hurled both of them flat, a huge column of flame instantly gouted up from the pit and rivers of fire ran rapidly across the high ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you it would be a hot one,\" Eldin yelled, gathering up the girl. \"Come on, let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Eldin slightly in the lead, they ran along the passage which led back to the throne room. As they went the glow of the fire behind them lit the way ahead for a short distance, panicking three Ter-men where they already stumbled to the now continuous shuddering of the foundations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout pause Eldin snatched the scythe from one of them, cut down the second and knocked aside the third; then grabbed Aminza\u0027s hand once more and ran as fast as his legs could carry him. Whenever they came to a junction of passageways, there they would halt for a few seconds while Eldin set fire to die walls; but now at last they approached the throne room proper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, in die maze of passages, corridors and tunnels which surrounded Lathi\u0027s chambers, a large number of Ter-men and maids were rushing aimlessly about in a frenzy of panic. Eldin and Aminza, for all that they stood out like sore thumbs, found themselves almost totally ignored-but die scarfaced dreamer was never one to be ignored for very long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a whoosh and a roar he set fire to one last junction of burrows, then dragged Aminza after him under the high sculpted archway which he recognized as the entrance to Lathi\u0027s throne room. They came to a breathless halt just inside the room and took in the scene at a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was awash with a sea of milling Ter-men and maids; and atop the dais steps Hero battled desperately against huge odds, using catlike speed and brute strength to hold the steps against a crush of scythe-wielding Ter-men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hero, catch!\" roared Eldin, and sent a scythe whirling through air, straight to the hand of the younger dreamer. And after that confusion turned to chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds die archway was blazing and Eldin and Aminza were battling their way through Lathi\u0027s dazed and disbelieving minions toward Hero. By the time they reached the foot of the dais its steps were already awash in the yellow blood of slain Ter-men. Atop the steps, berserk as any Viking ancestor of die waking world, Hero was drenched with the stuff where he stood astride a pile of Ter-men bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat with the siime on the steps and the now crazed heaving and bucking of die floor, it was hard work on the part of Aminza and Eldin to make it to Hero\u0027s side; but at last all three stood together. And up through the floor burst the Tree\u0027s roots, writhing and wriggling, adding to the chaos, flinging papery debris everywhere as they tore out the very foundations of Ladii\u0027s domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEldin deliberately grasped at a root that broke from the wall close by, and was immediately in communication with the Tree. \u0027Tree,\" he yelled out loud, \"we\u0027re finished here. Now how do we get out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My creepers,\" the Tree responded at once. \"I have two of them directly above you. Just let me give this place one last shake-there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throne room was wracked by tremendous tremors which had the three clinging together for support, and a moment later a great jagged crack appeared in the floor and ran up the wall. Huge areas of die ceiling began to cave in and daylight at once flooded the place. Down from above snaked a pair of tough green creepers which pounced on Eldin and Aminza and hauled them aloft. In another second the creepers were back, this time to lift Hero out onto the city\u0027s sagging, sliding roof. In one hand he now carried two wands, one of which glowed with a golden light. Behind him as he alighted on the treacherous roof, a great gush of flame sent a mushroom of smoke into dreamland\u0027s late-afternoon sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tree,\" cried Hero where he hung onto the creepers, \"it\u0027s time we all got out of here. I don\u0027t quite know how you, Eldin and Aminza managed all this, but I do know we\u0027re in for a scorching if we don\u0027t get moving!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can still help,\" answered the Tree. \"Just hang onto my creepers, all three of you, and run as hard as you can. You run and I\u0027ll pull, and with luck you\u0027ll be out of the city before it falls flat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed no second urging but hung on grimly as the Tree\u0027s stout creepers dragged them across Thalarion\u0027s shuddering, crumbling roof; and all about them the spindly spires of the city were falling into ruin and sending up clouds of dust and rags of shredded paper. Flames gouted up from a dozen points, raced over the roof, licked at the three where they leaped and stumbled through sinking, settling acres of disintegrating paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at last they were sliding down the outer domes, stumbling over dead, dry soil, running for the hills as behind them, roaring its death-agonies to the darkening sky, Thalarion became a mighty, raging inferno.... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hero-of-dreams-new-adventures-in-h-p-lovecraft-s-dreamlands-1/page-21.html","bookId":2599,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:21 PM"}
