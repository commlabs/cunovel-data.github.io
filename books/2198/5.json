{"id":101302,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eEric had turned to fill the window and block the rest of the car from the shooter\u0027s aim, and he got it in the neck. For an awful moment, Eric slumped back in the seat, his face blank and dark blood flowing sluggishly down his white skin. I screamed as if noise would protect me, and the gun pointed at me as the gunman leaned into the car to aim past Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d been a fool to do that. Eric\u0027s hand clamped on the man\u0027s wrist, and Eric began squeezing. The \"patrolman\" started doing a little shrieking of his own, flailing uselessly at Eric with his empty hand. The gun fell on top of me. I\u0027m just lucky it didn\u0027t discharge when it fell. I don\u0027t know much about handguns, but this one was big and lethal-looking, and I scrambled to an upright position and aimed it at the shooter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze in place, half in and half out of the window. Eric had already broken his arm and had kept a tight grip. The fool should have been more afraid of the vampire who had a hold on him than the waitress who hardly knew how to fire the gun, but the gun commanded his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure I would have heard if the highway patrol had decided to start shooting speeders instead of ticketing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" I said, and no one could blame me if my voice wasn\u0027t too steady. \"Who sent you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told me to,\" the Were gasped. Now that I had time to notice details, I could see he wasn\u0027t wearing a proper highway patrol uniform. It was the right color, and the hat was right, but the pants weren\u0027t uniform pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They, who?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric\u0027s fangs clamped into the Were\u0027s shoulder. Despite his wound, Eric was pulling the faux patrolman into the car inch by inch. It seemed only fair that Eric got some blood since he\u0027d lost so much of his own. The assassin began crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let him turn me into one of them,\" he appealed to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be so lucky,\" I said, not because I actually thought it was so darn great to be a vampire but because I was sure Eric had something much worse in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of the car because there was no point in trying to get Eric to release the Were. He wouldn\u0027t listen to me with the bloodlust on him so strong. My bond to Eric was the crucial factor in this decision. I was happy that he was enjoying himself, getting the blood he needed. I was furious that someone had tried to hurt him. Since both of these feelings would not normally be colors in my emotional palette, I knew what was to blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, the inside of the Corvette had gotten unpleasantly crowded, what with me, Eric, and most of the Were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiraculously, no cars passed while I trotted along the shoulder to our attacker\u0027s vehicle, which (not so much to my surprise) turned out to be a plain white car with an illegal flashing attachment. I turned out the car\u0027s lights and, by punching or disconnecting every wire and button I could find, managed to kill the flashers, too. Now we were not nearly so conspicuous. Eric had shut down the Corvette\u0027s lights moments into the encounter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over the inside of the white car quickly but didn\u0027t see an envelope marked \"Revelation of who hired me, in case I get caught.\" I needed a clue. There should at least have been a phone number on a scrap of paper, a phone number I could look up in a reverse directory. If I knew how to do such a thing. Rats. I trudged back to Eric\u0027s car, noticing in the lights of a passing semi that there weren\u0027t any legs sticking out of the driver\u0027s window anymore, which rendered the Corvette a lot less conspicuous. But we needed to get out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered into the Corvette and found it empty. The only reminder of what had just happened was a smear of blood on Eric\u0027s seat, and I pulled a tissue out of my purse, spat on it, and rubbed the drying blood off; not a very elegant solution, but practical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Eric was beside me, and I had to stifle a shriek. He was still excited by the unexpected attack, and he pinned me against the side of the car, holding my head at the correct angle for a kiss. I felt a lurch of desire and came very close to saying, \"What the hell, take me now, you big Viking.\" It was not only the blood bond inclining me to accept his tacit offer, but my memory of how wonderful Eric was in bed. But I thought of Quinn and detached myself from Eric\u0027s mouth with a great effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second, I didn\u0027t think he was going to let go, but he did. \"Let me see,\" I said in an unsteady voice, and pulled his shirt collar aside to look at the bullet wound. Eric had almost finished healing, but of course his shirt was still wet with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that about?\" he asked. \"Was that an enemy of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He shot at you,\" Eric said, as if I was just a wee bit slow. \"He wanted you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if he did that to hurt you? What if he would have blamed my death on you?\" I was so tired of being the object of plots that I suspected I was trying to will Eric into being the target. Another idea struck me, and I veered into it. \"And how\u0027d they find us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who knew we\u0027d be driving back to Bon Temps tonight,\" Eric said. \"Someone who knew what car I was in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It couldn\u0027t have been Niall,\" I said, and then rethought my flash of loyalty to my brand-new, self-proclaimed great-grandfather. After all, he might have been lying the whole time we were at the table. How would I know? I couldn\u0027t get in his head. The ignorance of my position felt strange to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t believe Niall had been lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it was the fairy, either,\" Eric said. \"But we\u0027d better talk about it on the road. This isn\u0027t a good place for us to linger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right about that. I didn\u0027t know where he\u0027d put the body, and I realized that I didn\u0027t really care. A year ago it would have torn me up, leaving a body behind as we sped away along the interstate. Now I was just glad it was him and not me who was lying in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a terrible Christian and a decent survivalist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we drove through the dark, I pondered the chasm yawning right in front of me, waiting for me to take that extra step. I felt stranded on that brink. I found it harder and harder to stick to what was right, when what was expedient made better sense. Really, my brain told me ruthlessly, didn\u0027t I understand that Quinn had dumped me? Wouldn\u0027t he have gotten in touch if he still considered us a couple? Hadn\u0027t I always had a soft spot for Eric, who made love like a train thundering into a tunnel? Didn\u0027t I have beaucoup evidence that Eric could defend me better than anyone I knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hardly summon the energy to be shocked at myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you find yourself considering who to take for a lover because of his ability to defend you, you\u0027re getting pretty close to selecting a mate because you think he has desirable traits to pass along to future generations. And if there\u0027d been a chance I could have had Eric\u0027s child (a thought that made me shiver), he would have been at the top of the list, a list I hadn\u0027t even known I\u0027d been compiling. I pictured myself as a female peacock looking for the male peacock with the prettiest display of tail, or a wolf waiting for the leader (strongest, smartest, bravest) of the pack to mount her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I\u0027d yucked myself out. I was a human woman. I tried to be a good woman. I had to find Quinn because I had committed myself to him... sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no quibbling!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking about, Sookie?\" Eric asked out of the darkness. \"Your face has had thoughts rippling across it too fast to follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that he could see me - not only in the dark, but while he was supposed to be watching the road - was exasperating and scary. And proof of his superiority, my inner cave-woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric, just get me home. I\u0027m in emotional overload.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t speak again. Maybe he was being wise, or maybe the healing was painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk about this again,\" he said when he pulled into my driveway. He parked in front of the house, turned to me as much as he could in the little car. \"Sookie, I\u0027m hurting... Can I...\" He leaned over, brushed his fingers over my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very idea, my body betrayed me. A throbbing started down low, and that was just wrong. A person shouldn\u0027t get excited at the idea of being bitten. That\u0027s bad, right? I clenched my fists so tightly my fingernails made my palms hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I could see him better, now that the interior of the car was illuminated with the harsh glare of the security light, I realized that Eric was even paler than usual. As I watched, the bullet began exiting the wound, and he leaned back against his seat, his eyes shut. Millimeter by millimeter, the bullet was extruded until it dropped into my waiting hand. I remembered Eric getting me to suck out a bullet in his arm. Ha! What a fraud he\u0027d been. The bullet would\u0027ve come out on its own. My indignation made me feel more like myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you can make it home,\" I said, though I felt an almost irresistible urge to lean over to him and offer my neck or my wrist. I gritted my teeth and got out of the car. \"You can stop at Merlotte\u0027s and get bottled blood if you really need some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hard-hearted,\" Eric said, but he didn\u0027t sound truly angry or affronted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" I said, and I smiled at him. \"You be careful, you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" he said. \"And I\u0027m not stopping for any policemen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made myself march into the house without looking back. When I was inside the front door and had shut it firmly behind me, I felt an immediate relief. Thank goodness. I\u0027d wondered if I was going to turn around at every step I took away from him. This blood tie thing was really irritating. If I wasn\u0027t careful and vigilant, I was going to do something I\u0027d regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am woman, hear me roar,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gosh, what prompted that?\" Amelia asked, and I jumped. She was coming down the hall from the kitchen in her nightgown and matching robe, peach with cream-colored lace trim. Everything of Amelia\u0027s was nice. She\u0027d never sneer at anyone else\u0027s shopping habits, but she\u0027d never wear anything from Wal-Mart, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a trying evening,\" I said. I looked down at myself. Only a little blood on the blue silk T-shirt. I\u0027d have to soak it. \"How have things gone here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Octavia called me,\" Amelia said, and though she was trying to keep her voice steady, I could feel the anxiety coming off her in waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mentor.\" I wasn\u0027t at my brightest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep, the one and only.\" She bent down to pick up Bob, who always seemed to be around if Amelia was upset. She held him to her chest and buried her face in his fur. \"She had heard, of course. Even after Katrina and all the changes it made in her life, she has to bring up the mistake.\" (That was what Amelia called it - the mistake.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what Bob calls it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia looked over Bob\u0027s head at me, and I knew instantly I\u0027d said a tactless thing. \"Sorry,\" I said. \"I wasn\u0027t thinking. But maybe it\u0027s not too realistic to think you can get out of this without being called to account, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" she said. She didn\u0027t seem too happy about my rightness, but at least she said it. \"I did wrong. I attempted something I shouldn\u0027t have, and Bob paid the price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, when Amelia decided to confess, she went whole hog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have to take my licks,\" she said. \"Maybe they\u0027ll take away my magic practice for a year. Maybe longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. That seems harsh,\" I said. In my fantasy, her mentor just scolded Amelia in front of a room full of magicians and sorcerers and witches or what-have-you, and then they transformed Bob back. He promptly forgave Amelia and told her he loved her. Since he forgave her, the rest of the assemblage did, too, and Amelia and Bob came back to my house and lived here together... for a good long while. (I wasn\u0027t too specific about that part.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the mildest punishment possible,\" Amelia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to know the other possible sentences.\" She was right. I didn\u0027t. \"Well, what mysterious errand did Eric take you on?\" Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia couldn\u0027t have tipped off anyone to our destination or route; she hadn\u0027t known where we were going. \"Oh, ah, he just wanted to take me to a new restaurant in Shreveport. It had a French name. It was pretty nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, this was like a date?\" I could tell she was wondering what place Quinn played in my relationship with Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, not a date,\" I said, sounding unconvincing even to myself. \"No guy-girl action going on. Just, you know, hanging out.\" Kissing. Getting shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sure is handsome,\" Amelia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, no doubt about it. I\u0027ve met some toothsome guys. Remember Claude?\" I\u0027d shown Amelia the poster that had arrived in the mail two weeks before, a blowup of the romance novel cover for which Claude had posed. She\u0027d been impressed - what woman wouldn\u0027t be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, I went to watch Claude strip last week.\" Amelia couldn\u0027t meet my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t take me!\" Claude was a very disagreeable person, especially when contrasted with his sister, Claudine, but he was beyond gorgeous. He was in the Brad Pitt stratosphere of male beauty. Of course, he was gay. Wouldn\u0027t you know it? \"You went while I was at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you wouldn\u0027t approve of my going,\" she said, ducking her head. \"I mean, since you\u0027re friends with his sister. I went with Tara. JB was working. Are you mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. I don\u0027t care.\" My friend Tara owned a dress shop, and her new husband, JB, worked at a women\u0027s exercise center. \"I would like to see Claude trying to act like he was enjoying himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he was having a good time,\" she said. \"There\u0027s no one Claude loves better than Claude, right? So all these women looking at him and admiring him... He\u0027s not into women, but he\u0027s sure into being admired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. Let\u0027s go see him together sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said, and I could tell she was quite cheerful again. \"Now, tell me what you ordered at this new fancy restaurant.\" So I told her. But all the while I was wishing I didn\u0027t have to keep silent about my great-grandfather. I wanted so badly to tell Amelia about Niall: how he looked, what he\u0027d said, that I had a whole history I hadn\u0027t known. And it would take me a while to process what my grandmother had endured, to alter my picture of her in light of the facts I\u0027d learned. And I had to rethink my unpleasant memories of my mother, too. She\u0027d fallen for my dad like a ton of bricks, and she\u0027d had his kids because she loved him... only to find that she didn\u0027t want to share him with them, especially with me, another female. At least, this was my new insight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was more stuff,\" I said, a yawn splitting my jaw in two. It was very late. \"But I\u0027ve got to get to bed. I get any phone calls or anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Were from Shreveport called. He wanted to talk to you, and I told him you were out for the evening and he should call you on your cell. He asked if he could meet up with you, but I said I didn\u0027t know where you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alcide,\" I said. \"I wonder what he wanted.\" I figured I\u0027d call him tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And some girl called. Said she\u0027d been a waitress at Merlotte\u0027s before, and she\u0027d seen you at the wedding last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tanya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that was her name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know. She said she\u0027d call back tomorrow or see you at the bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crap. I hope Sam didn\u0027t hire her to fill in or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I was the fill-in bargirl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, unless someone\u0027s quit. I warn you, Sam likes her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a treacherous bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gosh, tell me what you really think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kidding, Amelia, she took a job at Merlotte\u0027s so she could spy on me for the Pelts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s the one. Well, she won\u0027t spy on you again. I\u0027ll take steps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a scarier thought than working with Tanya. Amelia was a strong and skillful witch, don\u0027t get me wrong, but she was also prone to attempt things beyond her experience level. Hence Bob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check with me first, please,\" I said, and Amelia looked surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure,\" she said. \"Now, I\u0027m off to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her way up the steps with Bob in her arms, and I went to my small bathroom to remove my makeup and put on my own nightgown. Amelia hadn\u0027t noticed the speckles of blood on the shirt, and I put it in the sink to soak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a day it had been. I\u0027d spent time with Eric, who always rattled my chain, and I\u0027d found a living relative, though not a human one. I\u0027d learned a lot of stuff about my family, most of it unpleasant. I\u0027d eaten in a fancy restaurant, though I could hardly recall the food. And finally, I\u0027d been shot at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I crawled into bed, I said my prayers, trying to put Quinn at the top of the list. I thought the excitement of discovering a great-grandfather would keep me awake that night, but sleep claimed me right when I was in the middle of asking God to help me find my way through the moral morass of being party to a killing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-5.html","bookId":2198,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:11 PM"}
