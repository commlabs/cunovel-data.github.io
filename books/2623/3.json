I\u0027d already picked out a few likely prospects: two girls, a young guy, a boy. They were all potential targets, but which one of them was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy four candidates got into the same carriage. That was a stroke of luck at last. I followed them in and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne girl got out at Rizhskaya station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling of the target didn\u0027t get any weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young guy got out at Alekseevskaya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Was it the girl or the boy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI risked a stealthy glance at both. The girl was plump and pink-cheeked, she was absorbed in reading her MK newspaper, showing no signs of any kind of agitation. The boy, in contrast, was skinny and frail, standing by the door and tracing his finger across the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my opinion the girl was a lot more . . . tempting. Two to one it was her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, in judgements like that the question of sex decides pretty much everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d already begun hearing the Call. Still not verbalised yet, just a slow, gentle melody. I immediately stopped hearing the sound from my earphones. The Call easily drowned out any other music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither the girl nor the boy showed any signs of alarm. The target either had a very high threshold of resistance or had simply succumbed straight away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train stopped at Exhibition. The boy took his hand away from the glass, stepped out on to the platform and marched off rapidly towards the old exit. The girl stayed on the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both still too close to me, I couldn\u0027t tell which one I was sensing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the music of the Call soared triumphantly and words began to insinuate themselves into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA female voice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out between the closing doors, and hurried after the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunt was nearing its end at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how was I going to handle things with no charge on my amulet? I didn\u0027t have a clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a few people had left the train and there were five of us on the up escalator. The boy at the front, a woman with a small child behind him, then me, followed by an ageing, seedy-looking army colonel. The colonel\u0027s aura was beautiful, a glittering mass of steel grey and light blue tones. I thought with weary humour that I could call on him to help. Even these days people like that still believe in the idea of \u0027officer\u0027s honour\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that any help I could get from the colonel would be about as much use as a fly-swat on an elephant hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the stupid idea and took another look at the boy. With my eyes closed, observing his aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result was disheartening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surrounded by a shimmering, semi-transparent glow. Sometimes it was tinged with red, sometimes it was flooded with a dense green and sometimes it flared up in dark blue tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a rare case. A destiny still undefined. Undifferentiated potential. This boy could grow up to be a great villain, he could become a good and just person, or he could turn out to be a nobody, an empty space, which is actually what most people are anyway. It was all still ahead of him, as they say. Auras like that are normal for children up to the age of two or three, but they disappear almost completely as people get older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I could see why he was the one the Call was addressed to. There was no denying it – he was a real delicacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my mouth starting to fill up again with saliva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had all been going on for too long, far too long ... I looked at the boy, at the thin neck beneath his scarf, and I cursed my boss and the traditions, the rituals – everything that went to make up my job. My gums itched, my throat was parched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood has a bitter, salty taste, but this thirst can\u0027t be quenched by anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy hopped off the escalator, ran across the lobby and out through the glass doors. Just for a moment I felt relieved. I slowed down as I followed him out, and just caught a sense of movement out of the corner of my eye as he ducked down into an underpass. He was already running, physically drawn by the lure of the Call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaster!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran over to a kiosk and said, trying not to show my teeth:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The stuff that\u0027s six roubles, with the ring pull.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young guy with a pimply face handed me the quarter-litre bottle with a slow, sluggish movement – as though he\u0027d been taking a drop himself to keep warm on the job. He warned me candidly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s not great vodka. Not gut-rot, of course, it\u0027s Dorokhov, but, you know . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Got to look after my health, anyway,\u0027 I joked. The vodka was obviously fake, but right now that was okay by me. With one hand I tore off the cap with the ring pull and with the other I took out my phone and switched it to repeat dial. The young salesman stared – he must have been shocked that someone who could afford a mobile phone would buy such bad vodka. I took a swallow as I walked along – the vodka stank like kerosene and tasted even worse, it was definitely moonshine, bottled in the back of someone\u0027s garage – and ran to the underpass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hello.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarissa wasn\u0027t there any more. Pavel\u0027s usually on night duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is Anton. It\u0027s somewhere near the Cosmos hotel, in the back alleys. I\u0027m in pursuit.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You want the team?\u0027 The voice was beginning to sound interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. I\u0027ve already discharged the amulet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What happened?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA street bum bedded down halfway along the underpass reached out a hand as if he was hoping I\u0027d give him the bottle I\u0027d just started. I ran on past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Something else came up . . . Make it quick, Pavel.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys are already on their way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt as if a red-hot wire had been stuck through my jaws. Hell and damnation . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Pasha, I can\u0027t answer for myself I said quickly and rang off. I pulled up short, facing a police patrol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn\u0027t that always the way? Why do the human guardians of law and order always turn up at the most inappropriate moments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sergeant Kampinsky,\u0027 a young policeman announced briskly. \u0027Your papers . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered what they were planning to pin on me. Being drunk in a public place? That was probably it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand into my pocket and touched the amulet. Just barely warm. But this wouldn\u0027t take a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m not here,\u0027 I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four eyes that had been probing me in anticipation of easy pickings went blank as the last spark of reason in them died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re not here,\u0027 they echoed in chorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to program them. I blurted out the first thing that came into my head:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Buy some vodka and take a break. Now. Quick march!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe order clearly fell on fertile ground. The policemen linked arms like kids out looking for fun and dashed off along the underpass towards the kiosks. I felt vaguely uncomfortable, picturing the consequences of my instructions, but there was no time to put things right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurtled out of the underpass, certain I was already too late. But oddly enough, the boy still hadn\u0027t got very far. He was just standing there, swaying slightly, less than a hundred metres away. That was serious resistance. The Call was so loud now, it seemed strange to me that the occasional passers-by walking down the street didn\u0027t start dancing, that the trolleybuses didn\u0027t swing off the main avenue, forcing their way down along the alley towards their sweet fate . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy glanced round. I thought he looked at me. Then he set off again, walking quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it, he\u0027d broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him, frantically trying to decide what I was going to do. I ought to wait for the team – it would only take them ten minutes to get here, at most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that might not turn out so good – for the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePity\u0027s a dangerous thing. I gave way to it twice that day. The first time in the metro, when I spent the charge of the amulet in a useless attempt to displace the black vortex. And now the second time, when I set out after the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany years ago someone told me something that I flatly refused to accept. And I still don\u0027t accept it now, despite all the times I\u0027ve seen it proved right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The common good and the individual good rarely coincide . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I know. It\u0027s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut some truths are probably worse than lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started running towards the Call. What I heard was probably not what the boy did. For him the Call was an enchanting melody, sapping his will and his strength. For me it was just the opposite, an alarm call stirring my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirring my blood . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body I\u0027d been treating so badly all week was rebelling. I was thirsty, but not for water – I could quite safely slake my thirst with the dirty city snow without doing myself any harm. And not for strong drink either – I had that bottle of lousy vodka with me and even that wouldn\u0027t do me any damage. What I wanted was blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot pig\u0027s blood, or cow\u0027s blood, but real human blood. Curse this hunt . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You have to go through this,\u0027 the boss had said. \u0027Five years in the analytical department\u0027s a bit too long, don\u0027t you think?\u0027 I don\u0027t know, maybe it is a bit too long, but I like it. And after all, the boss himself hasn\u0027t worked out in the field for more than a hundred years now. I ran past the bright shop windows with their displays of fake Gzhel ceramics and stage-set heaps of food. There were cars rushing past me along the avenue, a few pedestrians. That was all fake too, an illusion, just one facet of the world, the only one accessible to humans. I was glad I wasn\u0027t one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout breaking my rapid stride, I summoned the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world sighed as it opened up. It was as if airport searchlights had suddenly come on behind me, casting a long, thin, sharp shadow. The shadow swirled up, gaining volume, the shadow was drawing me into itself – into a dimension where there are no shadows. The shadow detached itself from the dirty tarmac, swirling and swaying like a column of heavy smoke. The shadow was running ahead of me . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickening my stride, I broke through the grey silhouette into the Twilight. The colours of the world dimmed and the cars on the avenue slowed, as if they were suddenly heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting close to my goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I dodged into the alleyway, I thought I would just catch the final scene. The boy\u0027s motionless, ravaged body, drained dry, the vampires disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasn\u0027t too late after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was standing in front of a girl vampire who had already extended her fangs, slowly taking off his scarf. He was probably not afraid now – the Call completely numbs the conscious mind. More likely he was longing to feel the touch of those sharp, gleaming fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a young male vampire standing beside them. I sensed immediately that he was the leader of the pair: he was the one who was initiating her, he was introducing her to the scent of blood. And the most sickening thing about it was that he had a Moscow registration tag. Bastard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, that only improved my chances . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampires turned towards me in confusion, not understanding what was going on. The boy was in their Twilight, I shouldn\u0027t have been able to see him ... or them either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the male vampire\u0027s face began to relax, he even smiled – a calm, friendly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hi there ...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d taken me for one of his own. And he could hardly be blamed for his mistake: I really was one of them now. Almost. The week of preparation had not been wasted: I had begun to sense them . . . but I\u0027d almost gone over to the Dark Side myself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-3.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
