THORP\u0027S CABINET.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Dr. Thorp had been pleased with Peter Kirby, who had laid himself out to be agreeable, and the doctor was far from suspecting his real character. When this was revealed to him by Dean, he quickly decided to test it for himself. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Some men, inclined to be nervous and timid, would have had their apprehensions excited, and dreaded an encounter with a professional criminal. But Dr. Thorp was cool, resolute and determined. He proposed to facilitate Kirby\u0027s designs, and catch him in a trap.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he reached home he found Kirby smoking on the piazza.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you been taking a walk, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" answered Dr. Thorp. \"I made a call on a neighbor. I hope you have not been lonesome.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no! Your daughter has enabled me to pass178 the time pleasantly. But I am glad to see you back.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had Kirby known that Dr. Thorp had had an interview with Dean Dunham, his anxiety would have been excited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way, Doctor,\" said Kirby with apparent carelessness, \"I have a little money to invest. Can you recommend any form of investment?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You might buy a house in the village and settle down. I believe the next estate is for sale.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would certainly be an inducement to become your neighbor,\" said Kirby politely, \"but I am a rolling stone. I am always traveling. I couldn\u0027t content myself in any one place, not even in a large city.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suspect your mode of life makes frequent removals necessary,\" thought Dr. Thorp, though he did not say so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, if you don\u0027t care to invest in real estate,\" he said a moment later, \"you might purchase government bonds or railroad securities.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To which do you give the preference?\" asked Kirby.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor smiled inwardly. He saw that Kirby was trying to ascertain whether he had any negotiable securities in his possession, but he was ready to play into his hands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 179\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" he said, \"I think well of both.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I had some government bonds at one time,\" said Kirby, \"but they were stolen. That has made me cautious.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps you were careless.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No doubt I was. I kept them in a trunk at my boarding-house. I presume you wouldn\u0027t venture, even in a quiet village like this, to keep bonds in your house?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, we never receive visits from thieves or burglars. I don\u0027t consider trunks so safe as—that cabinet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He pointed to a black walnut cabinet with several drawers standing in one corner of the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirby\u0027s face lighted up. He had got the information he desired, but he resumed his indifferent manner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think you are right,\" he said. \"Besides, in a town like Carterville, as you say, thieves are hardly likely to be found.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, dear, no!\" said Dr. Thorp yawning. \"I have no occasion to borrow trouble on that score.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Living as I generally do in large cities where members of the criminal class abound,\" said Kirby, \"I am naturally more suspicious than you. I confess I wish I lived in a place of Arcadian innocence like this.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 180\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Thorp smiled. He was amused to hear one whom he believed to be a professional thief discourse in this manner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You might find it dull,\" he said, a little satirically, \"It would lack the spice and excitement of wickedness.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At a little after eleven Kirby signified that he was tired and was conducted to his bed-chamber. Dr. Thorp remained behind, and opening the lower drawer of his cabinet removed therefrom a roll of bank bills and a five hundred dollar government bond.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think these will be safe in my trunk to-night,\" he said to himself. \"Now, Mr. Kirby, you can explore the cabinet at your leisure. I doubt if you will find enough to repay you for your trouble.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirby occupied a chamber just over the sitting-room. He didn\u0027t undress himself, but threw himself on the bed to snatch a little rest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I found out very cleverly where the doctor kept his bonds,\" he soliloquized. \"He is an innocent, unsuspicious man, luckily for me. So no thieves or burglars ever visit Carterville,\" he repeated with a soft laugh. \"The good doctor would have been mightily surprised had he known the character of the man with whom he was talking. It is hardly a credit to take in a simple-minded man like the doctor. I very much regret the necessity of repaying his hospitality181 as I shall, but I need the bonds more than he does.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirby did not allow himself to sleep. There was important work to be done, and he must not run the risk of oversleeping himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He waited impatiently till he heard the public clock strike midnight, then taking off his shoes descended in his stocking feet to the sitting-room. There stood the cabinet plainly visible in the glorious moonlight that flooded the room, making artificial light unnecessary.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s an easy job for a man of my experience to open it,\" thought Kirby. \"I hope the doctor is sound asleep. He looks like a man who is safe to sleep all night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From his pocket he produced a bunch of skeleton keys, which he at once set himself to use. The lock on the drawer of the cabinet was a simple one, presenting no difficulty, and in less than five minutes he opened the upper drawer. A glance satisfied him that it contained nothing that he could make available. In turn he opened the other drawers, with equal ill success.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The doctor must have fooled me!\" he muttered impatiently, \"or is there some secret drawer that I have overlooked?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This question he asked himself, but he was far from expecting an answer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 182\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You have examined the cabinet pretty thoroughly Mr. Kirby,\" said a cool, calm voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirby sprang to his feet in wild dismay. There, looking at him from the doorway, was Dr. Thorp, his host, whom he was conspiring to rob.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are an early riser, are you not, Mr. Kirby?\" said the doctor composedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirby quickly decided upon his course.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where am I?\" he asked, passing his hand over his face in a bewildered way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where are you? Don\u0027t you recognize the room? A more pertinent query would be, \u0027What are you doing?\u0027\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good Heavens!\" ejaculated Kirby—\"I—I see it now. That unfortunate habit of walking in my sleep! What can you think of me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you generally carry skeleton keys about with you when you walk in your sleep, Mr. Kirby?\" asked the doctor pointedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I—I really don\u0027t know how to explain,\" stammered Kirby. \"These keys I found in my room on the morning after I was robbed. I took them with me, thinking they might be of use if I should lose my regular keys.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very ingeniously explained, upon my word!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t possible, Dr. Thorp, that you really take me for a thief! I hope you have more confidence in me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 183\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, it really did occur to me that you were a professional burglar. Your last words which I overheard before intruding upon you seem to bear out that supposition.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What were they?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Is there some secret drawer that I have overlooked?\u0027 Perhaps you will do me the favor to explain them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t. They were spoken unconsciously, I assure you. This habit of walking in my sleep has got me into trouble several times before.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then take my advice and discontinue it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will. I should have asked you to lock me in my chamber if I could have foreseen what has happened.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Kirby,\" said Dr. Thorp sternly, \"you must think I am a simpleton to be taken in by such a transparent falsehood. I was deceived in you, I admit, but now I understand your real character. I won\u0027t have you arrested, though I ought, but I require you to leave my house at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the middle of the night?\" said Kirby in dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. I cannot agree to shelter you even for the balance of the night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tell me one thing,\" said Kirby, changing his tone; \"did any one put you on your guard against me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 184\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was Dean Dunham.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can form your own conclusions.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is all you need tell me. I understand it all. I will go to my room and secure my luggage, and then bid you good-bye.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will wait for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I owe you another debt, Dean Dunham!\" said Kirby, as he left the house with the pleasant prospect of a sleepless night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81492.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:34 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:34 AM"}
