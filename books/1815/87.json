The groom isn’t supposed to see the wedding dress before the big day.” Her eyes widened with shock and horror. “You saw the dress I wore when we got married the first time!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had. I’d picked it out. “It was only a dress when I saw it,” I soothed. “It wasn’t a wedding dress until you wore it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” The smile came back. She peeled off her sandals and joined me, lying down with her head in my lap, her hair a silvery gold fan across my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning my fingers through the thick silk strands, I took a deep breath, relishing the smell of her perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to wear?” she asked, her eyes closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you picturing something in particular?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth curved. Her answer came out slow and dreamy. “A tux. You’re always gorgeous. But in a tuxedo, you’re something else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brushed my fingertips over her lips. There had been times when I hated my face, hated that my looks attracted intense sexual interest at a time when being lusted after made my skin crawl. Eventually, I got used to the attention, but not until Eva did I begin to value who I was for my own sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took so much pleasure in looking at me. Clothed. Unclothed. In the shower. Wrapped in a towel. On top of her. Underneath her. About the only time her eyes weren’t on me was when she was asleep. Which was when I often took the most pleasure in looking at her, lusciously naked, wearing nothing but the jewelry I’d given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A tux it is, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes opened, revealing the soft gray I adored. “But it’s a beach wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll make it work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I bet you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning her head, she nuzzled her nose against my cock. The heat of her breath drifted through the khakis to my sensitive skin. I hardened for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI played with her hair. “What do you want, angel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This.” She ran her fingers along the length of my erection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you want it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tongue darted out to wet her lips. “In my mouth,” she breathed, already freeing the button of my waistband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes closed for a moment on a deep inhalation. The sound of my zipper lowering, the release of pressure as she carefully freed my cock …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steeled myself for the wet heat of her mouth, but it was pointless. I jerked hard when she pulled me in with easy suction, hunger and need tingling down my spine. I knew her moods and how they translated to sex. She planned to take her time, to enjoy me and drive me out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva.” I groaned as she stroked me with gentle fingers, her mouth working softly. She tongued the head of my dick with slow, savoring licks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my eyes, I looked down at her. The sight of her, so perfectly presentable, her focus entirely on the feel of my cock in her mouth was both searingly erotic and achingly tender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, that’s good,” I said hoarsely, cupping the back of her head in one hand. “Take it deeper … yes, like that …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head fell back as my thighs tensed, straining with the need to thrust. I fought the urge, letting her take what she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t finish like this,” I warned her, knowing that was her goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hummed a protest and fisted me, pumping my cock in her soft, firm grip. Challenging me to resist her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be riding your perfect cunt, Eva. My cum is going to be deep inside you while you spend the weekend away from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes closed as I imagined her in Ibiza, a city famous for its wild nightlife, dancing with her friends in a crush of bodies. Men would covet her, dream of fucking her. All the while she’d be marked by me in the most primitive way possible. Possessed, even though I wasn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt her moan vibrate along the length of my dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back, her lips already red and plump. “That’s not fair,” she pouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught her wrist and lifted her hand to my chest, pressing it against my pounding heart. “You’ll be right here, angel. Always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mano, you can’t be working right now,” Manuel complained, dropping into the lounger beside me. “You’re missing the view.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up from my phone, the ocean breeze rifling through my hair. We’d remained in Barra today, directly across Avenida Lúcio Costa from the hotel we were staying in. Recreio Beach was more laid-back than Copacabana, less touristy and crowded. All along the shore, women in bikinis frolicked in the surf, breasts bouncing as they jumped waves, nearly-bare asses glistening with tanning oil. On the white sand in front of them, Arash and Arnoldo continued tossing a Frisbee back and forth. I’d bowed out when I felt my phone buzz in the pocket of my board shorts. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-87.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
