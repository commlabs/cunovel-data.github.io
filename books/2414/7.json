{"id":75439,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eLAS VEGAS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1954\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet held the sleeveless, full-skirted dress up, and did a twirl in front of the wall of mirrors. \"What do you think?\" she asked Cilla. \"The pink\u0027s more elegant, but I really want to wear white. Every girl should be able to wear white on her wedding day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll look beautiful. You\u0027ll look beautiful and young, and so incredibly happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I\u0027m all of those things. I\u0027m nineteen. I\u0027m a major movie star. My record is number one in the country. I\u0027m in love.\" She spiraled again, and again, spun-gold hair flying in gleaming waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in dreams, her sheer joy danced in the air, fluttered over Cilla\u0027s skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m madly in love with the most wonderful, the most handsome man in the world. I\u0027m rich, I\u0027m beautiful, and the world-right this moment-the world is mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It stays yours for a long time,\" Cilla told her. But not long enough. It\u0027s never long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should wear my hair up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet tossed the dress onto the bed where the pink brocade suit already lay discarded. \"I look more mature with my hair up. The studio never wants me to wear it up. They don\u0027t want me to be a woman yet, a real woman. Always the girl next door, always the virgin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, she began to fashion her sleek fall of hair into a French twist. \"I haven\u0027t been a virgin since I was fifteen.\" Janet met Cilla\u0027s eyes in the mirror. And with the joy layered amusement, and a thin coat of disdain. \"Do you think the public cares if I have sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some do. Some will. But it\u0027s your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn right. And my career. I want adult roles, and I\u0027m going to get them. Frankie\u0027s going to help me. Once we\u0027re married, he\u0027ll manage my career. He\u0027ll handle things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Cilla murmured, \"he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know what you\u0027re thinking.\" Standing in her white silk slip, Janet continued to place pins in her hair. \"Within the year I\u0027ll be filing for divorce. Then a brief reconciliation gets me knocked up with my second child. I\u0027m pregnant now, but I don\u0027t know it. Johnnie\u0027s already started inside me. Only a week or so, but he\u0027s begun. Everything changes today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You eloped to Vegas, married Frankie Bennett, who was nearly ten years older than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vegas was my idea.\" Janet picked up a can of hair spray from the dressing table, began to spray suffocating clouds of it. \"I wanted to stuff it down their throats, I guess. Janet Hardy, and all the parts she plays, wouldn\u0027t even know Vegas exists. But here I am, in the penthouse of the Flamingo, dressing for my wedding. And no one knows but me and Frankie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla walked to the window, looked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pool sparkled below, lush gardens flowing back from its skirting. Beyond, the buildings were small and on the tacky side. Colors faded, shapes blurred, like the old photographs Cilla supposed she\u0027d pieced together to form the landscape for the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing like it will be, really. Vegas, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll marry Bennett, and the studio will spin and spin to counteract the damage. But there won\u0027t be any, not really. You look so spectacular together, and that\u0027s almost enough. The illusion of two gorgeous people in love. And you\u0027ll take on your first true adult role with Sarah Constantine in Heartsong. You\u0027ll be nominated for an Oscar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After Johnnie. I have Johnnie before Heartsong. Even Mrs. Eisenhower will send a baby gift. I cut back on the pills.\" She tapped the bottle on her dressing table before turning to lift the dress. \"I\u0027m still able to do that, to cut down on the pills, the booze. It\u0027s easier when I\u0027m happy, the way I am now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you knew what would happen? If you knew Frankie Bennett will cheat on you with women, will gamble away so much of your money, squander more. If you knew he\u0027d break your heart and that you\u0027d attempt suicide for the first time in just over a year, would you go through with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet stepped into the dress. \"If I didn\u0027t, where would you be?\" She turned her back. \"Zip me up, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said, later, you\u0027ll say that your mother offered you like a virgin to the studio, and the studio tore the innocence out of you, piece by piece. And that Frankie Bennett took those pieces and shredded them like confetti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The studio made me a star.\" She fastened pearls at her ears. \"I didn\u0027t walk away. I craved what they gave me, and gave them my innocence. I wanted Frankie, and gave what was left to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up a double strand of pearls, and understanding, Cilla took them to hook around Janet\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do amazing work in the next ten years. My very best work. And I\u0027ll do some damn good work in the ten after that. Well, nearly ten,\" she said with a laugh. \"But who\u0027s counting? Maybe I needed to be in turmoil to reach my potential. Who knows? Who cares?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a soft smile, Janet turned to kiss Cilla\u0027s cheek. \"I looked for love all of my life, and gave it too often, and too intensely. Maybe if I hadn\u0027t looked so hard, someone would have given it back to me. The red belt!\" She danced away to snatch a thick scarlet belt from the clothes tossed on the bed. \"It\u0027s just the right touch, and red\u0027s Frankie\u0027s favorite color. He loves me in red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buckled it on, like a belt of blood, and stepped into matching shoes. \"How do I look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you could come, but it\u0027s only going to be me and Frankie, and the funny old justice of the peace and the woman who plays the spinet. Frankie will leak it to the press without telling me, and that\u0027s how the photo of the two of us coming out of the tacky little chapel gets into Photoplay. Then the shit hits the fan.\" She laughed. \"What a ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd laughed, and laughed, so that Cilla heard the echoes of the laughter as she woke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBECAUSE SHE WANTED to let her thoughts simmer away from the noise and distractions, Cilla spent the majority of her time the next two days sorting out the dozens of boxes and trunks she\u0027d hauled into the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla had determined on her first pass that her mother had already culled and scavenged whatever she deemed worthwhile. But Dilly had missed a few treasures. She often did, to Cilla\u0027s mind, being in such a rush to grab the shiniest object, she missed the little diamonds in the rough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the old photo tucked in a book. A very pregnant Janet plopped on a chaise by the pond, mugging for the camera with a glossily handsome Rock Hudson. Or the script for With Violets-Janet\u0027s second Oscar nomination-buried in a trunk full of old blankets. She found a little music box fashioned like a grand piano that played \"Fur Elise.\" Inside, a little handwritten note read: From Johnnie, Mother\u0027s Day, 1961, in Janet\u0027s looping scrawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of a rainy afternoon, she had a pile designated for the Dumpster, and a small stack of boxes to keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she hauled out a load in a wheelbarrow, she found the rain had turned to fragile sunlight and her front yard full of people. Ford and her landscaper stood on the wet grass laughing at each other, along with a man with steel-gray hair who wore a light windbreaker. Crossing to them from a little red pickup was the owner of the roofing company she\u0027d hired. A boy of about ten and a big white dog trailed after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some posturing, and looking out from between Ford\u0027s legs, Spock tiptoed-if dogs could tiptoe-up to the white dog, sniffed, then plopped down and exposed his belly in submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afternoon.\" Cleaver of Cleaver Roofing and Gutters gave her a nod of greeting. \"Had a job to check on down the road, and thought I\u0027d stop on the way home to let you know we\u0027ll be starting tomorrow if the weather\u0027s clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are my grandsons, Jake and Lester.\" He winked at Cilla. \"They don\u0027t bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandpa.\" The boy rolled his eyes. \"Lester\u0027s my dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Cilla crouched to greet the dog, Spock bumped through them to claim Cilla\u0027s hand. It was a clear: Uh-uh, you owe me first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleaver hailed the trio of men walking toward them. \"Tommy, you son of a...\" Cleaver slid his gaze toward his grandson, smirked. \"Gun. Don\u0027t think you can fast-talk this lady into selling. I\u0027ve got the roof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you doing, Hank? I\u0027m not buying. Just checking up on my boy here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla, this is my dad.\" Brian, the landscaper, gripped his father\u0027s shoulder. \"Tom Morrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a slick one, Miz McGowan,\" Hank warned her with another wink. \"You watch out for him. Before you know it, he\u0027ll talk you into selling this place, then put up a dozen houses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This acreage? No more than six.\" Tom offered a smile and his hand. \"Welcome to Virginia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. You\u0027re a builder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I develop land, residential and commercial. You\u0027ve taken on quite a project here. I\u0027ve heard you hired some good people to work on it. Present company excepted,\" he said with a grin to Hank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before these two get going,\" Brian interrupted, \"I\u0027ve got some sketches on the landscaping I wanted to drop off for you to look at. Do you want a hand with that haul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla shook her head. \"I\u0027ve got it. I\u0027m just going through the stuff I brought down from the attic, stowed in the barn. Rainy-day work, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian lifted a dented toaster out of the wheelbarrow. \"People keep the damnedest things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can attest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cleaned out the attic when my mother passed,\" Hank put in. \"Found a whole box of nothing but broken dishes, and another dozen or more full of papers. Receipts from groceries back thirty years, and God knows. But you want to be careful sorting through, Miz McGowan. Mixed all in there we found letters my daddy wrote her when he was in Korea. She had every one of our report cards-there\u0027s six of us kids- right through high school. She never threw a blessed thing out, but there\u0027re important things up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to take my time with it. I\u0027m finding it an interesting mix of both sides of my family so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, this used to be the McGowan farm.\" Tom scanned the area. \"I remember when your grandmother bought it from old man McGowan, back around 1960. My father had his eye on this land, hoping to develop it. He brooded for a month after Janet Hardy bought it-then he decided she wouldn\u0027t keep it above six months, and he\u0027d snap it up cheap from her. She proved him wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a pretty spot,\" Tom added, then gave his son a poke. \"See that you make it prettier. I\u0027d better get going. Good luck, Miss McGowan. If you need any recommendations on subs, just give me a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better get on, too.\" Hank pulled at the brim of his cap. \"Get my grandsons home for supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandpa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll talk another twenty minutes,\" Brian commented when his father and Hank strolled toward the red pickup. \"But I really do have to get going.\" He handed Cilla a large manila envelope. \"Let me know what you think, what kind of changes you might want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Brian tossed the toaster into the Dumpster, he shot a finger at Ford. \"Later, Rembrandt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a short laugh, Ford waved. \"Around and about, Picasso.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rembrandt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short story. Wait. Jesus.\" After she\u0027d handed him the envelope and started to push the wheelbarrow up the Dumpster\u0027s ramp, Ford nudged her aside. \"Flex your muscles all you want, but not while I\u0027m standing here holding paper and guys are around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved the envelope back at her, then rolled the wheelbarrow up to dump. \"Brian and I could both draw, and somehow or other got into a sex-parts-and-positions drawing contest. We got busted passing sketches back and forth in study hall. Earned us both a three-day pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pass to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down as he dumped. \"Suspension. I guess you didn\u0027t go to regular school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tutors. How old were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About fourteen. I got my ears burned all the way home when my mother picked me up, and got grounded for two weeks. Two weeks, and it was my first and last black mark in school. Talk about harsh. Hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet they still have them,\" she said when he rolled the barrow down again. \"And future generations will find them in the attic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think? Well, they did show considerable promise and a very healthy imagination. Want to go for a ride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can go get some dinner somewhere, catch a movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s playing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t say. I\u0027m thinking of the movie as a vehicle for popcorn and necking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good,\" she decided. \"You can put the wheelbarrow back in the barn while I wash up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWITH HER NEW WIRING APPROVED, Cilla watched Dobby and his grandson replaster the living room walls. Art came in many forms, she decided, and she\u0027d found herself a pair of artists. It wouldn\u0027t be quick, but boy, it would be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do fancy work, too?\" she asked Dobby. \"Medallions, trim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here and there. Not much call for it these days. You can buy pre-made cheaper, so most people do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not most people. Fancy work wouldn\u0027t suit this area.\" Hands on hips, she turned a circle in the drop-clothed, chewed-up living space.\"But simple and interesting might. And could work in the master bedroom, the dining room. Nothing ornate,\" she said, thinking out loud. \"No winged cherubs or hanging grapes. Maybe a design. Something Celtic... that would address the McGowan and the Moloney branches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moloney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Sorry.\" Distracted, she glanced back at Dobby. \"Moloney would have been my grandmother\u0027s surname-except her mother changed it to Hamilton just after Janet was born, then the studio changed it to Hardy. Gertrude Moloney to Trudy Hamilton to Janet Hardy. They called her Trudy as a girl,\" she added and thought of the letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" Dobby shook his head, dipped his trowel. \"Pretty, old-fashioned name Trudy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And not shiny enough for Hollywood, at least when she came up in it. She said in an interview once that no one ever called her Trudy again, once they\u0027d settled on Janet. Not even her family. But sometimes she\u0027d look at herself in the mirror and say hello to Trudy, just to remind herself. Anyway, if I came up with some designs, we could talk about working them in upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sure could do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do some research. Maybe we could... Sorry,\" she said when the phone in her pocket rang. She pulled it out, stifled a sigh when she saw her mother\u0027s number on the display. \"Sorry,\" she repeated, then stepped outside to take the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think I wouldn\u0027t hear about it? Did you think I wouldn\u0027t see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla leaned against the veranda column, stared across the road at Ford\u0027s pretty house. \"I\u0027m good, thanks. How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no right to criticize me, to judge me. To blame me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what context?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save your sarcasm, Cilla. You know exactly what I\u0027m talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t.\" What was Ford doing? Cilla wondered. Was he writing? Drawing? Was he turning her into a warrior goddess? Someone who would face down evil instead of calculating how to stretch the budget to accommodate handcrafted plaster medallions, or handle a motherly snit long-distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The article in the paper. About you, about the farm. About me. AP picked it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they? And that bothers you? It\u0027s publicity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027McGowan\u0027s goal is to restore and respect her neglected heritage. Speaking over the busy sounds of banging hammers and buzzing saws, she states: \"My grandmother always spoke of the Little Farm with affection, and related that she was drawn to it from the first moment. The fact that she bought the house and land from my paternal great-grandfather adds another strong connection for me.\" \u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what I said, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027My purpose, you could even say my mission, is to pay tribute to my heritage, my roots here, by not only restoring the house and the land, but making them shine. And in such a way that respects their integrity, and the community.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds a little pompous,\" Cilla commented. \"But it\u0027s accurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes on and on, a showcase during Janet Hardy\u0027s visits for the luminaries of her day. A pastoral setting for her children, now peeling paint, rotted wood, overgrown gardens through a generation of neglect and disinterest as Janet Hardy\u0027s daughter, Bedelia Hardy, attempted to fill her mother\u0027s sparkling footsteps. How could you let them print that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know as well as I do you can\u0027t control the press.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you giving any more interviews.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you should know you can\u0027t control what I do, or don\u0027t. Not anymore. Spin it, Mom. You know how. Grief kept you away, and so on. Whatever happy times you spent here were overshadowed, even smothered, by your mother\u0027s death here. It\u0027ll get you some sympathy and more press.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long pause told Cilla her mother was considering the angles. \"How could I think of that place as anything but a tomb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easier for you, it\u0027s different for you. You never knew her. She\u0027s just an image for you, a movie clip, a photograph. She was flesh and blood for me. She was my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be better, for everyone, if you vetted interviews with me or Mario. And I\u0027d think any reporter who works for a legitimate paper would have contacted my people for a comment or quote. Be sure they do, next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re up early,\" Cilla said by way of evading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have rehearsals, costume fittings. I\u0027m exhausted before I begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a trouper. I wanted to ask you something. The last year or so, before Janet died, do you know who she was involved with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romantically? She could barely get out of bed by herself half the time in the first weeks after Johnnie. Or she\u0027d bounce off the walls and demand people and parties. She\u0027d cling to me one minute, and push me away the next. It scarred me, Cilla. I lost my brother and my mother so close together. And really, I lost them both the night Johnnie died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she believed that, if nothing else, that was deeply and painfully true, Cilla\u0027s tone softened. \"I know. I can\u0027t imagine how terrible it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one can. I was alone. Barely sixteen, and I had no one. She left me, Cilla. She chose to leave me. In that house you\u0027re so determined to turn into a shrine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m doing. Who was she involved with, Mom? A secret affair, a married man. An affair that went south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had affairs. Why wouldn\u0027t she? She was beautiful and vital, and she needed love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A specific affair, during this specific period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Dilly\u0027s voice clipped on the words now. \"I try not to think about that time. It was hell for me. Why do you care? Why dredge that kind of thing up again? I hate the theories and the speculations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTread carefully, Cilla reminded herself. \"I\u0027m just curious. You hear talk, and she did spend a lot of time here in that last year, year and a half. She wasn\u0027t really involved with anyone back in L.A., that I\u0027ve heard about. It wasn\u0027t like her to be without a man, a lover, for very long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men couldn\u0027t resist her. Why should she resist them? Then they\u0027d let her down. They always do. They make promises they don\u0027t keep. They cheat, they steal, and God knows they can\u0027t stand for the woman to be more successful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how are things with you and Num-with Mario?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the exception to the rule. I\u0027ve finally found the kind of man I need. Mama never did. She never found a man worthy of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And never stopped looking,\" Cilla prompted. \"She would have wanted the comfort, the love and support, especially after Johnnie died. Maybe she looked here, in Virginia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. She never took me with her back to the farm after Johnnie. She said she had to be alone. I didn\u0027t want to go back anyway. It was too painful. That\u0027s why I haven\u0027t been back in all these years. It\u0027s still a fresh wound in my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we come full circle, Cilla thought. \"Like I said, I\u0027m just curious. So if something or someone occurs to you, let me know. I\u0027d better let you get to rehearsal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, let them wait! Mario had the best idea. It\u0027s phenomenal, and such a good opportunity for you. We\u0027ll work a duet for you and me into the show, in the second act. A medley of Mama\u0027s songs with clips and stills from her movies on screen behind us. We\u0027ll finish with \u0027I\u0027ll Get By,\u0027 making it a trio, putting her onstage with us, the way they did with Elvis and Celine Dion. He\u0027s talking to HBO, Cilla, about broadcasting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll need you back here next week for rehearsals, and costume design, choreography. We\u0027re still working out the composition, but the number would run about four minutes. Four spectacular minutes, Cilla. We want to give you a real chance for a comeback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla closed her eyes, debated sawing off her tongue, letting it fly- and settled on somewhere in the middle. \"I appreciate that, I really do. But I don\u0027t want to come back, geographically or professionally. I don\u0027t want to perform. I want to build.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be building.\" Enthusiasm bubbled across the continent. \"Your career, and helping me. The three Hardy women, Cilla. It\u0027s landmark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name\u0027s McGowan, Cilla thought. \"I think you\u0027d be better spotlighted alone. And the duet with Janet? That could be lovely, heart-wrenching. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s four minutes, Cilla. You can spare me four fucking minutes a night for a few weeks. And it will turn your life around. Mario says-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just finished turning my life around, and I like where it\u0027s standing. I\u0027ve got to go. I\u0027ve got work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla closed the phone, deliberately shoved it back into her pocket. She heard the throat clear behind her and, turning, saw Matt in the doorway. \"They just got the grouting done on the tile in the bathroom upstairs. Thought you\u0027d want to take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We\u0027ll be installing the fixtures tomorrow then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get my sledgehammer. We can start taking down that wall up there. I\u0027m in the mood for demo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE WAS LITTLE, Cilla decided, more satisfying than beating the hell out of something. It relieved frustration, brought a quick and wild rise of glee, and fulfilled all manner of dark fantasies. The fact was, it was-on several levels-every bit as therapeutic as good sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd since she wasn\u0027t having any sex-good or otherwise-at the moment, knocking down walls did the job. She could be having sex, she thought as she strode out of the house trailing plaster dust. Ford and his magic mouth had made that fairly clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was on a kind of moratorium there-as part of the turn-the-life-around program, she supposed. New world, new life, new style. And in there, she\u0027d found the real Cilla McGowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe liked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the house to rehab, her contractor\u0027s license to study for, a business to establish. And a family mystery to unravel. Scheduling in sex with her hot neighbor wouldn\u0027t be the smartest move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he just had to be standing out on his veranda when she walked out, thinking of sex. And the low-down tingle had her asking herself if it was really, completely, absolutely necessary to abstain. They were both adults, unattached, interested, so why couldn\u0027t she walk on over there and suggest they spend the evening together? Doing something more energetic than sharing a beer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust straight out. No dance, no pretenses, no illusions. Isn\u0027t that what the real Cilla wanted? She angled her head as she considered. And plaster dust rained down from the bill of her cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she should shower first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re weak and pitiful,\" Cilla muttered and, amused at herself, started to circle around to the back of the house and the landscaping crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the deep-throated roar of a prime engine, glanced back. The sleek black bullet of a Harley shot down the road and seemed to ricochet through her open gates. Even as it spit gravel, she ran toward it, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts occupant jumped off the bike, landed on scarred combat boots and caught Cilla on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, doll.\" He swung her in one quick circle, then kissed her enthusiastically. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-7.html","bookId":2414,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM"}
