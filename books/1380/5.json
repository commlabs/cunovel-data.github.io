{"id":21474,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. THE CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.","content":"We must now go back to our other hero, or, rather, to another of our heroes. Arthur Wilkinson is our melancholy love-lorn tenor, George Bertram our eager, excitable barytone, and Mr. Harcourt—Henry Harcourt—our bass, wide awake to the world\u0027s good things, impervious to sentimentality, and not over-scrupulous—as is always the case with your true deep-mouthed opera bass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our present business is with the excitable barytone, whom we left some year and a half ago in not a very clear state of mind as to the walk in life which would be best suited for his peculiar legs. Harcourt, who was himself a lawyer, recommended the law. Selfish as was the general tone of Harcourt\u0027s heart, still he had within him a high, if not a generous feeling, which made him wish to have near him in his coming life a friend of such promise as George Bertram. Bertram might beat him in his career; nay, probably would do so; but, nevertheless, Harcourt wished to see him keeping his terms in London. He was convinced that he should gain more than he should lose by such a friend.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Bertram\u0027s own mind was not so easily made up. His personal possessions in life may be thus catalogued. He had come of a good family; he had received the best education which England could give him; he was quick in speech and ready in thought; he had a double-first degree, and would at once have a fellowship; he had also an uncle who was very rich and occasionally very disagreeable, and a father who was very poor, and of whom he heard all men say that he was one of the most agreeable fellows that ever lived. Such being his stock in trade, how was he to take it to the best market? and what market would be the best?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In thinking over his markets, it must not be supposed that his only object, or his chief object, was the making of money. That was a rock, rather, of which it behoved him to be very careful. The money-making part of every profession was, according to his present views, a necessary incidental evil. To enable a poor man like him to carry on his work some money must be made; for some sorts of work, perhaps for that very sort which he would most willingly choose, much money must be made. But the making of it should never be his triumph. It could be but a disagreeable means to a desirable end. At the age of twenty-two so thought our excitable barytone hero on that point.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two ends appeared to him to be desirable. But which of the two was the most desirable—that to him was the difficult question. To do good to others, and to have his own name in men\u0027s mouths—these were the fitting objects of a man\u0027s life. But whether he would attempt the former in order to achieve the latter; or obtain, if he did obtain, the latter by seeking success in the former: on this point his character was not sufficiently fixed, nor his principles sufficiently high to enable him fitly to resolve.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the necessity of seeing his uncle before he took any actual steps secured him from the necessity of coming to any absolutely immediate decision. He and Harcourt were together for three or four days, and he listened not unmoved to his friend\u0027s eloquence in favour of public life in London. Not unmoved, indeed, but always with a spirit of antagonism. When Harcourt told of forensic triumphs, Bertram spoke of the joy of some rustic soul saved to heaven in the quiet nook of a distant parish. When his friend promised to him Parliament, and the later glories of the ermine, he sighed after literary fame, to be enjoyed among the beauties of nature. But Harcourt understood all this: he did not wish to convince his friend, but only to lead him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. George Bertram senior was a notable man in the city of London. I am not prepared to say what was his trade, or even whether he had one properly so called. But there was no doubt about his being a moneyed man, and one well thought of on \u0027Change. At the time of which I write, he was a director of the Bank of England, chairman of a large insurance company, was deep in water, far gone in gas, and an illustrious potentate in railway interests. I imagine that he had neither counting-house, shop, nor ware-rooms: but he was not on that account at a loss whither to direct his steps; and those who knew city ways knew very well where to meet Mr. George Bertram senior between the hours of eleven and five.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was ten years older than his brother, Sir Lionel, and at the time of which I write might be about seventy. He was still unmarried, and in this respect had always been regarded by Sir Lionel as a fountain from whence his own son might fairly expect such waters as were necessary for his present maintenance and future well-being. But Mr. George Bertram senior had regarded the matter in a different light. He had paid no shilling on account of his nephew, or on other accounts appertaining to his brother, which he had not scored down as so much debt against Sir Lionel, duly debiting the amount with current interest; and statements of this account were periodically sent to Sir Lionel by Mr. Bertram\u0027s man of business,—and periodically thrown aside by Sir Lionel, as being of no moment whatsoever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Mr. Bertram had paid the bill due by his brother to Mr. Wilkinson, there was outstanding some family unsettled claim from which the two brothers might, or might not, obtain some small sums of money. Sir Lionel, when much pressed by the city Cr?sus, had begged him to look to this claim, and pay himself from the funds which would be therefrom accruing. The city Cr?sus had done so: a trifle of two or three hundred pounds had fallen to Sir Lionel\u0027s lot, and had of course been duly credited to his account. But it went a very little way towards squaring matters, and the old man of business went on sending his half-yearly statements, which became anything but \"small by degrees.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Bertram had never absolutely told George of this debt, or complained of his not being repaid the advances which he had made; but little hints dropped from him, which were sometimes understood for more than they were worth, and which made the young Oxonian feel that he would rather not be quite so much in his uncle\u0027s hands. The old man gave him to understand that he must not look on himself as an heir to wealth, or imagine that another lot was his than that ordinary to mortals—the necessity, namely, of eating his bread in the sweat of his brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Mr. Bertram ordinarily lived at Hadley, a village about a mile beyond Barnet, just on the border of what used to be called Enfield Chase. Here he had an establishment very fit for a quiet old gentleman, but perhaps not quite adequate to his reputed wealth. By my use of the word reputed, the reader must not be led to think that Mr. Bertram\u0027s money-bags were unreal. They were solid, and true as the coffers of the Bank of England. He was no Colonel Waugh, rich only by means of his rich impudence. It is not destined that he shall fall brilliantly, bringing down with him a world of ruins. He will not levant to Spain or elsewhere. His wealth is of the old-fashioned sort, and will abide at any rate such touch of time as it may encounter in our pages. But none of the Hadleyites, or, indeed, any other ites—not even, probably, the Bank-of-Englandites, or the City-of-London-Widows\u0027-Fundites—knew very well what his means were; and when, therefore, people at Hadley spoke of his modest household, they were apt to speak of it as being very insufficient for such a millionaire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hitherto George had always passed some part of his vacations at Hadley. The amusements there were not of a very exciting nature; but London was close, and even at Hadley there were pretty girls with whom he could walk and flirt, and the means of keeping a horse and a couple of pointers, even if the hunting and shooting were not conveniently to be had.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few days after the glories of his degree, when his name was still great on the High Street of Oxford, and had even been touched by true fame in a very flattering manner in the columns of the \"Daily Jupiter,\" he came home to Hadley. His uncle never encouraged visits from him in the city, and they met, therefore, for the first time in the old man\u0027s drawing-room just before dinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How are you, George?\" said the uncle, putting out his hand to his nephew, and then instantly turning round and poking the fire. \"What sort of a journey have you had from Oxford? Yes, these railways make it all easy. Which line do you use? Didcot, eh? That\u0027s wrong. You\u0027ll have a smash some of these days with one of those Great Western express trains\"—Mr. Bertram held shares in the opposition line by which Oxford may be reached, and never omitted an opportunity of doing a little business. \"I\u0027m ready for dinner; I don\u0027t know whether you are. You eat lunch, I suppose. John, it\u0027s two minutes past the half-hour. Why don\u0027t we have dinner?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not a word was said about the degree—at least, not then. Indeed Mr. Bertram did not think very much about degrees. He had taken no degree himself, except a high degree in wealth, and could not understand that he ought to congratulate a young man of twenty-two as to a successful termination of his school-lessons. He himself at that age had been, if not on \u0027Change, at any rate seated on the steps of \u0027Change. He had been then doing a man\u0027s work; beginning to harden together the nucleus of that snowball of money which he had since rolled onwards till it had become so huge a lump—destined, probably, to be thawed and to run away into muddy water in some much shorter space of time. He could not blame his nephew: he could not call him idle, as he would have delighted to do had occasion permitted; but he would not condescend to congratulate him on being great in Greek or mighty in abstract mathematics.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, George,\" said he, pushing him the bottle as soon as the cloth was gone, \"I suppose you have done with Oxford now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not quite, sir; I have my fellowship to receive.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some beggarly two hundred pounds a year, I suppose. Not that I mean to say you should not be glad to have it,\" he added, thus correcting the impression which his words might otherwise have made. \"As you have been so long getting it, it will be better to have that than nothing. But your fellowship won\u0027t make it necessary for you to live at Oxford, will it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no. But then I may perhaps go into the church.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, the church, eh? Well, it is a respectable profession; only men have to work for nothing in it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish they did, sir. If we had the voluntary system—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can have that if you like. I know that the Independent ministers—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should not think of leaving the Church of England on any account.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have decided, then, to be a clergyman?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no; not decided. Indeed, I really think that if a man will work, he may do better at the bar.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, indeed—if he have the peculiar kind of talent necessary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But then, I doubt whether a practising barrister can ever really be an honest man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They have such dirty work to do. They spend their days in making out that black is white; or, worse still, that white is black.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pshaw! Have a little more charity, master George, and do not be so over-righteous. Some of the greatest men of your country have been lawyers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But their being great men won\u0027t alter the fact; nor will my being charitable. When two clear-headed men take money to advocate the different sides of a case, each cannot think that his side is true.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fiddlestick! But mind, I do not want you to be a lawyer. You must choose for yourself. If you don\u0027t like that way of earning your bread, there are others.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A man may be a doctor, to be sure; but I have no taste that way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And is that the end of the list?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is literature. But literature, though the grandest occupation in the world for a man\u0027s leisure, is, I take it, a slavish profession.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Grub Street, eh? Yes, I should think so. You never heard of commerce, I suppose?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Commerce. Yes, I have heard of it. But I doubt whether I have the necessary genius.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old man looked at him as though he doubted whether or no he were being laughed at.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The necessary kind of genius, I mean,\" continued George.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very likely not. Your genius is adapted to dispersing, perhaps, rather than collecting.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I dare say it is, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I suppose you never heard of a man with a—what is it you call your degree? a double-first—going behind a counter. What sort of men are the double-lasts, I wonder!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is they, I rather think, who go behind the counters,\" said George, who had no idea of allowing his uncle to have all the raillery on his side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it, sir? But I rather think they don\u0027t come out last when the pudding is to be proved by the eating. Success in life is not to be won by writing Greek verses; not though you write ever so many. A ship-load of them would not fetch you the value of this glass of wine at any market in the world.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Commerce is a grand thing,\" said George, with an air of conviction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is the proper work for men,\" said his uncle, proudly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I have always heard,\" replied the nephew, \"that a man in this country has no right to look to commerce as a profession unless he possesses capital.\" Mr. Bertram, feeling that the tables had been turned against him, finished his glass of wine and poked the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few days afterwards the same subject was again raised between them. \"You must choose for yourself, George,\" said the old man; \"and you should choose quickly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I could choose for myself—which I am aware that I cannot do; for circumstances, after all, will have the decision—but, if I could choose, I would go into Parliament.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go where?\" said Mr. Bertram, who would have thought it as reasonable if his nephew had proposed to take a house in Belgrave Square with the view of earning a livelihood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Into Parliament, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is Parliament a profession? I never knew it before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps not, ordinarily, a money-making profession; nor would I wish to make it so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what county, or what borough do you intend to honour by representing it? Perhaps the University will return you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps it may some of these days.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And, in the meantime, you mean to live on your fellowship, I suppose?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"On that and anything else that I can get.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Bertram sat quiet for some time without speaking, and George also seemed inclined to muse awhile upon the subject. \"George,\" said the uncle, at last, \"I think it will be better that we should thoroughly understand each other. You are a good fellow in your way, and I like you well enough. But you must not get into your head any idea that you are to be my heir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir; I won\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because it would only ruin you. My idea is that a man should make his own way in the world as I made mine. If you were my son, it may be presumed that I should do as other men do, and give you my money. And, most probably, you would make no better use of it than the sons of other men who, like me, have made money. But you are not my son.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quite true, sir; and therefore I shall be saved the danger. At any rate, I shall not be the victim of disappointment.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am very glad to hear it,\" said Mr. Bertram, who, however, did not give any proof of his gladness, seeing that he evinced some little addition of acerbity in his temper and asperity in his manner. It was hard to have to deal with a nephew with whom he could find so little ground for complaint.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I have thought it right to warn you,\" he continued, \"You are aware that up to the present moment the expense of your education has been borne by me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir; not my education.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not your education! How, then, has it been borne?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I speak of my residence at Oxford. I have had a great many indulgences there, and you have paid for them. The expenses of my education I could have paid myself.\" This was fair on George\u0027s part. He had not asked his uncle for a liberal allowance, and was hardly open to blame for having taken it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I only know I have paid regularly one hundred and fifty pounds a year to your order, and I find from Pritchett\"—Pritchett was his man of business—\"that I am paying it still.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He sent me the last quarter the other day; but I have not touched it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never mind; let that pass. I don\u0027t know what your father\u0027s views are about you, and never could find out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll ask him. I mean to go and see him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go and see him! Why, he\u0027s at Bagdad.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. If I start at once I shall just catch him there, or perhaps meet him at Damascus.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you\u0027ll be a great fool for your pains—a greater fool almost than I take you to be. What do you expect your father can do for you? My belief is, that if four hundred pounds would take him to heaven, he couldn\u0027t make up the money. I don\u0027t think he could raise it either in Europe or Asia. I\u0027m sure of this; I wouldn\u0027t lend it him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In such a case as that, sir, his personal security would go for so little.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"His personal security has always gone for little. But, as I was saying, I have consented ever since you went to Wilkinson\u0027s to allow your father to throw the burthen of your expenses on my shoulders. I thought it a pity that you should not have the chance of a decent education. Mind, I claim no gratitude, as I shall expect your father to pay me what I have advanced.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How on earth can he do that, sir? But perhaps I can.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you? very well; then you can settle it with him. But listen to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Listen to me for a moment, uncle George. I think you are hard on my father, and certainly hard on me. When I went to Wilkinson\u0027s, what did I know of who paid the bill?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who says you knew anything, sir?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And, counting on from that time, at what period ought I to have begun to know it? When should I have first learnt to feel that I was a burden to any one?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who has talked about a burden?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You say I am not to be your heir?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never thought of being your heir. I don\u0027t care a straw about being anybody\u0027s heir. What you have given freely, I have taken freely. As for my father, if you felt so harshly towards him, why did you let him incur this debt?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was to see you kicked out of Wilkinson\u0027s house and starve in the ditch, I suppose? But now, if you can control your fine feelings for one moment, will you listen to me? I have never blamed you in the matter at all, and don\u0027t blame you now—at least not yet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you never will—that is about money matters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now do listen to me. It seems to me that you are quite astray about a profession. You don\u0027t like commerce, and what you said the other day about capital is quite true. I count a man a knave who goes into trade without capital. In a small way we might, perhaps, have managed it. But in a very small way you would not have liked it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Neither small nor great, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well. You need not be afraid that anything very great will be thrust upon you. But it seems to me that what you are most fitted for is a lawyer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Young Bertram paused a moment. \"Uncle, I really hardly know. Sometimes I have a strange desire to go into orders.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very strange indeed! But now, if you will listen to me—I have been speaking to Mr. Dry. Messrs. Dry and Stickatit have done business for me for the last forty years. Now, George, I will advance you three thousand pounds at four per cent.—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What should I want with three thousand pounds?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t suppose you can get into a house like that without money, do you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And be an attorney?\" said George, with a look of horror which almost penetrated the thick skin of the old man\u0027s feelings. What! had he taken a double-first, been the leading man of his year, spouted at the debating club, and driven himself nearly dizzy with Aristotle for this—for a desk in the office of Messrs. Dry and Stickatit, attorneys of old Bucklersbury! No, not for all the uncles! not for any uncle!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They net four thousand pounds a year,\" said Mr. Bertram; \"and in process of time you would be the working partner, and have, at any rate, a full half of the business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But, no! George was not to be talked into such a scheme as that by the offer of any loan, by the mention of any number of thousands. He positively refused to consider the proposition; and his uncle, with equal positiveness, refused to hold any further converse with him on the subject of a profession. \"Pritchett will pay you your present allowance,\" said he, \"for two years longer—that is, if I live.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can do without it, sir,\" said George.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pritchett will pay that amount for two years,\" said the uncle, with great positiveness; \"after that it will be discontinued. And for the next three months I shall be happy to see you here as my guest.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It will be readily believed that George Bertram did not overstay the three months.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75461.html","bookId":1380,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:06:16 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:06:16 PM"}
