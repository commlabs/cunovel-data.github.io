The last door on the left was still closed. He ducked into the kitchen. Linsky was on the floor, on his back in a pool of blood. Reacher relit the flame under the kettle. Then he stepped out to the hallway. Walked quietly to the front of the house and leaned on the wall beyond the last door on the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kettle boiled after five minutes. The whistle started low and quiet, and then the note and the volume rose to full blast. Within ten seconds the second floor of the house was full of an insane shrieking. Ten seconds after that, the door on Reacher\u0027s right opened. A small man stepped out. Reacher let him take a pace forward and then spun him around and jammed the Smith 60 hard in the base of his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec. He was a wide, ancient, twisted, stooped, battered old man. A wraith. Barely human. He was covered in livid scars and patches of discolored skin. His face was lined and drooping and seething with rage and hatred and cruelty. He was unarmed. His ruined hands didn\u0027t seem capable of holding a weapon. Reacher forced him down the hallway. Into the kitchen, backward. To the stove. The noise from the kettle was unbearable. Reacher used his left hand and killed the flame. Then he hauled the Zec back toward the living room. The kettle\u0027s whistle died away, like an air raid siren winding down. The house went quiet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over,\" Reacher said. \"You lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s never over,\" the Zec replied. Hoarse voice, low, guttural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess again,\" Reacher said. He kept the Smith hard against the Zec\u0027s throat. Too low and too close for him to see it. He eased the hammer back. Slowly, carefully. Deliberately. Loudly. Click-click-click-crunch. An unmistakable sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m eighty years old,\" the Zec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re a hundred,\" Reacher said. \"You\u0027re still going down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Idiot,\" the Zec said back. \"I meant I\u0027ve survived things worse than you. Since long before you were born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s worse than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t flatter yourself. You\u0027re nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\" Reacher said. \"You were alive this morning and you won\u0027t be tomorrow. After eighty years. That makes me something, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over,\" Reacher said. \"Believe me. Long and winding road, OK, I understand all of that, but this is the end of it. Had to happen sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know when my birthday is?\" Reacher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s in October. You know what day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to find out the hard way. I\u0027m counting in my head. When I reach my birthday, I\u0027m going to pull the trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started counting in his head. First, second. He watched the Zec\u0027s eyes. Fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth. No response. Tenth, eleventh, twelfth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" the Zec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNegotiation time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The twelfth,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s how long you lasted. Then you gave it up. You know why? Because you want to survive. It\u0027s the deepest instinct you\u0027ve got. Obviously. Otherwise how would you have gotten as old as you are? It\u0027s probably a deeper instinct than I could ever understand. A reflex, a habit, roll the dice, stay alive, make the next move, take the next chance. It\u0027s in your DNA. It\u0027s what you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now we\u0027ve got ourselves a competition. What you are, against what I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the guy who just threw Chenko out a third-floor window. After crushing Vladimir to death with my bare hands. Because I didn\u0027t like what they did to innocent people. So now you\u0027ve got to pit your strong desire to survive against my strong desire to shoot you in the head and piss in the bullet hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One shot,\" Reacher said. \"In the head. Lights out. That\u0027s your choice. Another day, another roll of the dice. Or not. As the case may be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw calculation in the Zec\u0027s eyes. Assessment, evaluation, speculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could throw you down the stairs,\" he said. \"You could crawl over and take a look at Vladimir. I cut his throat afterward. Just for fun. That\u0027s who I am. So don\u0027t think I don\u0027t mean what I say. I\u0027ll do it and I\u0027ll sleep like a baby the rest of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" the Zec asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help with a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s an innocent man I need to get out of the prison ward. So I need you to tell the truth to a detective called Emerson. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I need you to finger Chenko for the shooting, and Vladimir for the girl, and whoever it was for Ted Archer. And whatever else you\u0027ve done. The whole nine yards. Including how you and Linsky set it all up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker in the Zec\u0027s eyes. \"Pointless. I\u0027d get the death penalty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you would,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s for damn sure. But you\u0027d still be alive tomorrow. And the next day, and the next. The appeals process lasts forever here. Ten years, sometimes. You might get lucky. There might be a mistrial, there might be a jailbreak, you might get a pardon, there might be a revolution, or an earthquake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unlikely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" Reacher said. \"But isn\u0027t that who you are? A guy who will take the tiniest slim fragment of a chance to live another minute, as opposed to no chance at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already answered me once,\" Reacher said. \"When you quit the birthday game on the twelfth of October. That was pretty fast. There are thirty-one days in October. Law of averages said you\u0027d be OK until the fifteenth or the sixteenth. A gambler would have waited for the twentieth. But you didn\u0027t get past the twelfth. Not because you\u0027re a coward. Nobody could accuse you of that. But because you\u0027re a survivor. That\u0027s who you are. Now what I want is some practical confirmation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirteenth,\" Reacher said. \"Fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" the Zec said. \"You win. I\u0027ll talk to the detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher pinned him against the hallway wall with the Smith. Took out his phone. \"Gunny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on in, all of you. I\u0027ll open the door. And, Franklin? Wake those guys up, like we talked about before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone went dead. Franklin had killed the comms net to make his calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher tied the Zec\u0027s wrists and ankles with wire torn from table lamps and left him on the living room floor. Then he went downstairs. Glanced into the surveillance room. Vladimir was on his back in a lake of blood. His eyes were open. So was his throat. Reacher could see bone. Sokolov was slumped facedown on the table. His blood was all over the place. Some of it must have seeped into the wiring, because the South monitor had shorted out. The other three pictures were still there, green and ghostly. On the West monitor four figures were visible on the driveway. Yellow haloes, red cores. Close together, moving fast. Reacher turned the lights off and closed up the room. Walked on down the hallway and opened the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanni came in first. Then Cash. Then Rosemary. Then Helen. She was barefoot and carrying her shoes in her hand. She was covered in mud. She stopped in the doorway and hugged Reacher hard. Held him for a long moment and then moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that smell?\" Yanni asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood,\" Cash said. \"And other organic fluids of various kinds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they all dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All but one,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led the way upstairs. Stopped Rosemary outside the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Zec is in there,\" he said. \"You OK about seeing him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see him,\" she said. \"I want to ask him a question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped into the living room. The Zec was on the floor, where Reacher had left him. Rosemary stood over him, quiet, dignified, not gloating. Just curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she said. \"I mean, to an extent I understand what you thought you had to do. From your warped perspective. But why didn\u0027t you just use Chenko from the highway? Why did you have to bring my brother down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec didn\u0027t answer. He just stared into space, seeing something, but probably not Rosemary Barr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psychology,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ours. The public\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There had to be a story,\" Reacher said. \"No, there was a story, and he had to control what the story was about. If he gave up a shooter, then the story would be about the shooter. No shooter, the story would have been about the victims. And if the story had been about the victims, too many questions would have been asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he sacrificed James.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what he does. There\u0027s a long list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joseph Stalin,\" Yanni said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher kicked the Zec aside and pulled the sofa away from the window about four feet. Grabbed the Zec\u0027s collar and hauled him up and dumped him on one end. Got him sitting up straight against the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our star witness,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told Cash to perch on the windowsill behind the sofa. Told Yanni to go find three dining chairs. Pushed armchairs against the side walls. Yanni came back three separate times dragging chairs behind her. Reacher put them in a line facing the sofa. He ended up with a square arrangement, sofa, dining chairs, armchairs off to the sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis clothes were nearly dry. Just a little dampness where the seams were thick. He ran his fingers through his hair. Patted it down. Checked his watch. Nearly four in the morning. Least resistance. A biorhythm thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we wait,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited less than thirty minutes. Then they heard cars on the road far away in the distance. Tires on the blacktop, engine noise, exhaust pipes. The sounds grew louder. The cars slowed. They crunched onto the limestone driveway. There were four of them. Reacher went downstairs and opened the door. Saw Franklin\u0027s black Suburban. Saw Emerson sliding out of a gray Crown Vic. Saw a compact woman with short dark hair getting out of a blue Ford Taurus. Donna Bianca, he assumed. He saw Alex Rodin climbing out of a silver BMW. Rodin locked it with his remote. He was the only one who did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher stood aside and let them gather in the hallway. Then he led them upstairs. He put Alex Rodin and Donna Bianca and Emerson in the dining chairs, left to right. He put Franklin in an armchair next to Yanni. Rosemary Barr and Helen Rodin were in armchairs on the other side of the room. Helen was looking at her father. He was looking at her. Cash was on the windowsill. Reacher stepped away and leaned up in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start talking,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec stayed silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can send these guys away again,\" Reacher said. \"Just as easily as I brought them here. Then I\u0027ll start counting again. At the seventeenth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec sighed. Started talking. Slowly at first, and then faster. He told a long story. So much length and so much complexity that it got confusing. He spilled details of earlier unconnected crimes. Then he got to the bidding process for the city contracts. He named the official he had suborned. It wasn\u0027t just about money. There had been girls too, supplied in small groups in a Caribbean villa. Some of them very young. He talked about Ted Archer\u0027s fury, his two-year search, his close approach to the truth. He described the ambush, one Monday morning. Jeb Oliver had been used. The red Dodge Ram had been his payoff. Then the Zec paused, decided, moved on. He described the fast decision to get rid of Oline Archer two months later, when she became dangerous. He described Chenko\u0027s subterfuge, the hasty but thorough planning, how they lured James Barr out of the way with a promise of a date with Sandy Dupree. He described the end of Jeb Oliver\u0027s usefulness. He told them where to find his body. He told them about Vladimir killing Sandy in an effort to stop Reacher in his tracks. Altogether he talked for thirty-two minutes, hands tied behind him, then he stopped suddenly and Reacher saw calculation in his eyes. He was already thinking about the next move. The next roll of the dice. A mistrial. A jailbreak. A ten-year appeals process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room went quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonna Bianca said, \"Unbelievable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said, \"Keep talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec just looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something you left out,\" Reacher said. \"You need to tell us about your inside man. That\u0027s what we\u0027re all waiting for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec switched his gaze. He looked at Emerson. Then at Donna Bianca. Then at Alex Rodin. Right to left, along the line. Then he glanced back at Reacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a survivor,\" Reacher said. \"But you\u0027re not an idiot. There won\u0027t be a mistrial. There won\u0027t be a jailbreak. You\u0027re eighty years old and you won\u0027t survive a ten-year appeals process. You know all that. But still you agreed to talk. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you knew sooner or later you\u0027d be talking to a friend. Someone you own. Someone you bought and paid for. Am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone right here, right now, in fact,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing always bothered me,\" Reacher said. \"From the start. At first I didn\u0027t know if I was right or if I was letting my ego get in the way. I went back and forth with it. Finally I decided I was right. The thing is, when I was in the service I was a hell of a good investigator. I was maybe the best they ever had. I would have put myself up against anyone. And you know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Helen Rodin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never have thought of emptying that parking meter. Not in a million years. It would never have occurred to me to do that. So I was facing a question. Was Emerson a better investigator than me? Or did he know that quarter was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emerson is not better than I was,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s just not possible. That\u0027s what I decided.\" Then he turned to the Zec. \"The coin was one clue too many. You see that now? It was unnatural. Was it Chenko\u0027s idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have overruled him,\" Reacher said. He turned to Emerson. \"Or you should have left it there. It wasn\u0027t like you needed it to make the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is bullshit,\" Emerson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head. \"A lot of things clicked into place after that. I read the 911 transcripts and the squad car call log. Right at the start you were awful quick to make up your mind. You had a bunch of incoherent panic calls but within twenty seconds you were on the radio telling your guys that this was a lone nutcase with an automatic rifle. There was no basis for that conclusion. Six shots fired, ragged sequence, it could have been six kids with a handgun each, firing once. But you knew it wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit,\" Emerson said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head again. \"Final proof was when I was negotiating with your boss here. I said he\u0027d have to tell the truth to a detective called Emerson. I could have said the cops generically, or Alex Rodin the DA. But I didn\u0027t. I said your name specifically, and a little light came on in his eyes. He sparred around for a minute more, for form\u0027s sake, but basically he agreed real fast because he figured he\u0027d be OK as long as you were in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. Then Cash said, \"But Oline Archer went to Alex Rodin here. He buried it. That\u0027s what you found out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head again. \"We found out that Oline went to the DA\u0027s office. I went there myself, first thing after I got to town. And you know what? Alex here has got himself a couple of real dragon ladies working the door. They know he doesn\u0027t like walk-ins. Dollars to doughnuts they sent Oline on her way. That\u0027s a matter for the police, they\u0027ll have told her. Her co-worker said she was gone most of the afternoon. My guess is the dragon ladies sent her trekking all across town to the station house, where she sat down with Emerson here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zec struggled on the sofa. \"Emerson, do something, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing he can do,\" Reacher said. \"I\u0027m not dumb. I think ahead. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s got a Glock under his arm, but he\u0027s got me behind him with a.38 and a knife, and he\u0027s got Cash facing him with a sniper rifle hidden behind the sofa, and what can he do anyway? I guess he could try to kill us all and say there was some kind of a big massacre here, but how would that help him with NBC?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NBC?\" Cash repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw Yanni fiddling with her phone earlier. I\u0027m assuming she\u0027s transmitting all of this back to the studios.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanni pulled out her Nokia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open channel,\" she said. \"Digital audio recording on three separate hard discs, plus two analog tapes as backup. They\u0027ve all been running since well before we got in the Humvee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCash stared at her. \"That\u0027s why you asked me that dumb question about the night scope. That\u0027s why you were talking to yourself like a sports announcer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a journalist,\" Reacher said. \"She\u0027s going to win an Emmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped forward and leaned over the back of Emerson\u0027s chair and slid his hand under his coat. Came back out with a Glock nine. Handed it to Bianca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got arrests to make,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Zec smiled, and Chenko walked into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenko was covered in mud and his right arm was broken, or his shoulder, or his collarbone, or maybe all three. His wrist was jammed into his shirt like a sling. But there was nothing wrong with his left arm. Nothing at all. Reacher turned around to face him and saw the sawn-off rock-steady in his left hand. He thought, irrelevantly: Where did he get that from? His car? Were the cars parked to the east?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenko glanced at Bianca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the gun down, lady,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca laid Emerson\u0027s Glock on the floor. No sound as it touched the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Chenko said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I was out for a little while,\" Chenko said. \"But I got to tell you, I feel a whole hell of a lot better now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We survive,\" the Zec said from across the room. \"That\u0027s what we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher didn\u0027t look back at the old man. He looked at Chenko\u0027s gun instead. It had been a Benelli Nova Pump. The stock had been cut off behind the pistol grip. The barrel had been hacked off ahead of the slide. Twelve-gauge. Four-shot magazine. A handsome weapon, butchered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emerson,\" the Zec called. \"Come over here and untie me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher heard Emerson stand up. He didn\u0027t look back at him. Just took a tiny pace forward and sideways, closer to Chenko. He was a foot taller and twice as wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a knife here,\" Emerson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The soldier\u0027s got a knife,\" Chenko said. \"I\u0027m damn sure of that, based on what I saw happened to my buddies downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher moved a little closer to him. A big guy and a little guy directly face-to-face, separated by about three feet, most of which was occupied by the Benelli. Reacher\u0027s waist was level with Chenko\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knife,\" Emerson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come and get it,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slide it across the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll shoot,\" Chenko said. \"Twelve-gauge, in the gut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher thought: And then what? A pump-action shotgun ain\u0027t much use to a one-armed man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So shoot,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt eyes on him. He knew everyone was looking at him. Staring at him. Silence buzzed in his ears. He was suddenly aware of the smells in the room. Dust in the carpet, worn furniture, fear, tension, damp night air blowing in from the open door downstairs and the busted window upstairs and carrying with it the odor of rich earth and fertilizer and budding new growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" he said. \"Shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenko did nothing. Just stood there. Reacher stood there directly in front of him. He knew exactly how the room was laid out. He had arranged it. He pictured it in his mind. Chenko was in the doorway facing the window. Everyone else was facing the other way. Reacher himself right in front of Chenko, face-to-face, close enough to touch. Cash directly behind him all the way in back, behind the sofa, on the windowsill, staring forward. Then the Zec on the sofa, looking the same way. Then Emerson in the middle of the floor, near the Zec, standing up, indecisive, watching. Then Yanni and Franklin and Helen and Rosemary Barr in the armchairs against the side walls, heads turned. Then Donna Bianca and Alex Rodin on their dining chairs, twisted around at the waist, eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher knew where everyone was, and he knew what they were looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot,\" he said. \"Aim at my belt. That\u0027ll work. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenko did nothing. Just stared up at him. Reacher was so close and so big he was all Chenko could see. It was just the two of them, like they were alone in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help you out,\" Reacher said. \"I\u0027ll count to three. Then you pull the trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenko just stood there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand?\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stepped out of the way. Just took a long fast sideways shuffle to his right. Cash fired from behind the sofa at the spot where Reacher\u0027s belt had been a split second before, and Chenko\u0027s chest blew apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cash put his rifle back on the floor just as silently as he had picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo night-shift squad cars came and took the Zec and Emerson away. Then four ambulances arrived for the casualties. Bianca asked Reacher what exactly had happened to the first three. Reacher told her he had absolutely no idea. None at all. He speculated that it might have been some kind of an internal dispute. A falling-out among thieves, maybe? Bianca didn\u0027t push it. Rosemary Barr borrowed Franklin\u0027s cell phone and used it to call area hospitals, looking for a safe berth for her brother. Helen and Alex Rodin sat close together, talking. Gunny Cash sat in a chair and dozed. An old soldier\u0027s habit. Sleep when you can. Yanni stepped up close to Reacher and said, \"Rough men stand ready in the night.\" Reacher found himself very aware of the live phone. He just smiled and said, \"I\u0027m usually in bed by twelve o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" Yanni said. \"Alone. You remember my address?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher smiled again, and nodded. Then he went downstairs and stepped out to the front porch and walked a little ways south across the dirt until he could see past the bulk of the house to the eastern sky. Dawn was coming. Black shaded to purple right on the horizon. He turned and watched the last ambulance loading up. Vladimir\u0027s final ride, judging by the size of the shape under the sheet on the gurney. Reacher emptied his pockets and left Emerson\u0027s torn business card, and Helen Rodin\u0027s cocktail napkin, and the motor court\u0027s big brass key, and the Smith 60, and Gunny Cash\u0027s Navy SEAL SRK, all in a neat little pile beside the front door. Then he asked the paramedics if he could ride with them to town. He figured he could walk east from the hospital and be at the bus depot before the sun was fully up. He could be in Indianapolis before lunch. Then he could buy a pair of shoes and be just about anywhere before the sun went down again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-shot-jack-reacher-9/page-17.html","bookId":2347,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:48 AM"}
