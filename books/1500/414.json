A moment later, a virtual diagram of the entire northern mountain region appeared. She drew a circle around a rather large area with her finger. “From what I currently know, the chances of Phoney being in this region are quite great. Also, this is where the special forces are the most active. There seems to be a few special forces members that haven’t joined in on the battle yet.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eO’Brien stored the region Helen drew out in his memory. He then stood up and said, “Thank you, older sister Helen. Then I have to head out right now, so please wish me luck. Right, I forgot to do some introductions.

Instead, he said with a smile, “Haven’t you said before that data actually cannot prove everything?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen O’Brien and Alan left the reception room, only now did a sea of data flood Helen’s great brain, and it also began to operate at a speed comparable to supercomputing centers. A while later, O’Brien’s probability of success emerged. Only when she saw the result did Helen relax a bit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this moment, O’Brien had just walked out from the entrance of Persephone’s private hospital. The bright sunlight made both of them slightly narrow their eyes. The off-road vehicle at the side of the street started up before slowly heading in their direction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs he waited for the vehicle to arrive, O’Brien smiled as he gave the familiar Dragon City around him a look, his eyes carrying a hint of reluctance. He then slowly said, “Alan, how confident do you feel?

When he heard O’Brien’s question, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “The sentence of data not being able to decide everything is something I already heard twice today. If our luck isn’t too bad, in a few years, our military success might be recorded in the Black Dragonriders’ textbooks, an example of a seventh level abilities defeating generals.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen O’Brien heard Alan’s words, he patted his shoulder and said, “You absolutely cannot look down on older sister Helen.

His intrinsic nature to unconsciously look down on women was great, especially a woman without any abilities. However, he didn’t plan to let this bother him too much, nor was he used to doubting something O’Brien repeatedly emphasized. Instead, he just asked, “What is our following plan?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Get on the plane and head north.” O’Brien said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Plane?” This time, Alan became a bit more clear-headed. He asked with a bit of shock, “What kind of plane can fly to a blasted place like the north?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“The plane is actually quite ordinary, but I know a person who can definitely fly to the north.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Who?” Alan was quite curious about this individual.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Even I’ve never met that individual.

He was carrying a five meters long steel bar and walking towards a half built structure several hundred meters out. This was a ten meter tall, several dozen meter long building that doubled as both a storehouse and factory building. It had a steel frame, with the outside covered in lightweight boards. About half of the project had already been completed, and the steel frame was pretty much done. However, there wasn’t a single worker on the construction site, so it seemed like the captain intended to complete the entire process alone.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlong with his heavy and forceful footsteps, the captain’s dark skin continuously wriggled about. Beads of sweat continuously trickled downwards, leaving behind shining trails on his black skin. He carried a steel part that was several tons in weight, and each time his foot raised and lowered, they would always leave behind a clear footprint on the ground.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Captain!” A cry sounded from behind Curtis.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurtis didn’t pay the call any attention. Only when he reached the hangar and placed the steel part down did he turn around and say with a rather deep voice, “Little fella, what are you doing here instead of sitting tight in your own territory?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eO’Brien still had a smile on his face, as if he didn’t see that Curtis’ small eyes seemed to contain a tangible radiance. With a rather relaxed voice, he said, “I want to ask Flying Bear to send us north.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“North? At this time of year?” Curtis’ eyes suddenly became sharp, and then they dimed. Then, with a somewhat absent minded tone, he asked, “You want to go to war?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eO’Brien shook his head and said, “I don’t want to, but I have no choice.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurtis gave O’Brien a deep look, and then he began to move his arms around a bit to stretch out his muscles.

It wasn’t bad, but it definitely wasn’t anything incredibly precious. As such, there was immediately an undisguised disappointment on his face.
