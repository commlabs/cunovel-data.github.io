Too bad someone was also keeping a close eye on me, which I realized the moment I stepped outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI zipped my coat. Tightened my messenger bag against my side. My eyes adjusted to the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he pounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasuo. I recognized him instantly, even in the darkness. I’d know that telltale silhouette anywhere—tall and lean, with wiry muscles and black hair that still managed to have a hip LA vibe despite the fact that we were on an island in the middle of the North Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tackled me, and I shoved him off easily. “What the hell?” I rolled to my feet, dusting off my arms. The attack had felt halfhearted, so maybe he didn’t really want to hurt me. Maybe he just didn’t know how to broach talking with me. I jogged back a step. “If you want to talk, just say so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis only answer was the rasp of his heavy breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Earth to Yasuo,” I said uneasily. “Please, can we just stop for a second?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he still didn’t answer. He just stood there, trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was full dark now—most of January was—and I angled my body to let the moonlight hit his face. Something was wrong with him, and it wasn’t that he had that detached, vampiric thing going on, either. He appeared stricken, with glazed eyes that stared out to some distant place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped closer. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis attention snapped to me—it was like he’d forgotten I was there—and he leapt again. His fangs were bared this time, and I narrowly ducked out of the way of his gaping mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrieked and stumbled back. “What the hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came again and kept coming, slashing his hands, pawing at me, diving for me, but I skittered backward, using quick left and right hooks to deflect his advances. I shouted, “What is your problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was clearly something very, very wrong with him, and I needed to do something before he sank his teeth into me. I couldn’t turn and run—no matter how trembly he was, with those long legs, he’d beat me in a foot race. My only hope was to fight him off. Maybe talk him down enough to get some answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst step was getting away from his crazily windmilling limbs. I lunged and ducked under an arm, grabbing his coat and shoving him in front of me. He doubled over easily, and I hopped onto his back, snatching him into a basic choke hold, using both arms to trap his neck from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wriggled madly, clawing at my forearms, but my wool coat was too thick for him to get purchase. His moves were spazzy and weak. Had something happened to him? Was he sick? “Did someone attack you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, a disturbing cackle, and dropped to his knees. The hideous noise he was making faded, but not completely, and I realized he was muttering to himself, nonsensical sounds, with no real words coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re freaking me out.” I released his neck and shoved him to the ground, quickly readjusting my pose, straddling him as he lay on his belly, and wrenching his arms up behind his back. I curled my full body weight over him and snarled in his ear, “Tell me. Just…dammit”—I struggled to keep hold, riding him like a bucking bronco—“tell me, Yas. What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shaking like mad now. I could feel the tremors reverberate up my body. “Do you think I’ll see her?” he said, and his cracking voice made him sound like a boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the—?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. “Emma? But she’s not alive.” I told myself hope was dead, that he was just hallucinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop,” he shrieked, turning his head, resting it on the ground. “Stop saying her name. Emma’s gone. So just…fucking…stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snapped then, just lost it completely. His body gave up, and he became boneless beneath me. A horrible keening sound cut between us—and oh God, Yas was making that sound—as he began to cry great heaving sobs where he lay in the icy dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like his mind snapped, too, and he began to babble again, but loudly this time, manic, scattered gibberish. About Emma. About the castle and vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, I wondered if there’d been a bond between him and Emma. Could Trainees even bond? Surely they’d had some sort of connection. Would her sudden death cause a pain even deeper than grief? Would it be a pain great enough to drive a person to madness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook him, pleading, “Why are you acting like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew if a vampire left, it could be devastating to his bonded partner, but how did it feel for the vampire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had I never broached this with Carden?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden. Damn him. This latest attack only served to remind me of his absence. I blamed him for my vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long breath shuddered from Yasuo, and I actually had to pause and tune in to see if he was still even breathing. A thin rope of foamy spit dribbled from his mouth onto the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was making some sort of transition, and it wasn’t a good one. Was he injured? Was this a broken bond? Merely grief? Something haunted Yasuo deeply, and it gave me a chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid from him and rubbed between his shoulder blades. He was limp as a rag, and I was confident—kind of—that his attack had paused for the moment. “Are you okay?” I asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hitched up to his elbows and stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then I noticed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jesus, Yasuo.” I sprang backward in the dirt, snatching my hands to my chest as though burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged himself to his hands and knees and began to skitter away. Finally, finally, he uncurled his body and stood, loping into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes, they’d glowed red. Gone was the stillness and blankness of Vampire. When he’d looked at me, he’d looked like a rabid animal, lacking reason or focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d looked like a Draug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me several minutes to calm down. My heart pounded, my hands shook, but still I managed to do a body check. Adrenaline could mask pain. I’d seen girls so involved in a fight, they were unaware they had a weapon sticking from them. But as I tugged my clothes back into place, I saw I was relatively unscathed—physically, at least. Emotionally, I was a wreck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked. Shattered. Grieving. I was steeped in my grief—choked by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasuo was Draug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraug meant dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYas was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr he might as well be, if what I’d seen was really true. I still couldn’t wrap my brain around it. I couldn’t believe it. But I’d seen his eyes, those red, soulless eyes that I’d seen before. I thought of the Draug in Tom’s pens, remembered those hands reaching through bars, clawing the air, mindlessly swiping for food. Anxious to taste blood. To taste fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that why Yas had been so unhinged lately? I’d imagined that when a Trainee turned Draug, it would be an immediate thing. An instant change. But if Yas was any indication, it was a slow, laborious process. Like devolving into madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a madness that had its roots in the castle, in what they did inside the castle. What they did to the guys. To the girls. To all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annelise?” The familiar voice pulled me from my morbid thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ronan?” I gaped at him, completely thrown now. I was reeling, unable to make sense of anything, and it was surreal to see Ronan. In my moment of need, it wasn’t Carden who’d appeared, but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” I looked from him to the dining hall and back again, realizing I’d just been standing there, staring at the students spilling from its doors. For an instant, each was illuminated by a pool of light before walking into the night. Their bellies were full; they were sad or happy or anxious, each immersed in his or her own world, completely unaware of me in my hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hell where Yas was gone from me. From everyone. Forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annelise?” He peered at me, equal parts concern and puzzlement. “I said, are you going to dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dinner.” I shook my head, shaking my mind back into reality. “No. Not happening.” I doubted I’d ever eat again, my stomach was in such knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t deal with this right now, this concern from Ronan. Was he here to protect me or simply because he’d wanted to seek me out? It made me feel confused and exposed. “Yeah,” I answered tightly. “I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I say you’re not.” He stepped closer and took my arm, and I flinched away, but he took it again, at the elbow, with a grip both firm and gentle. “Come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over my shoulder at the dining hall and asked, “Don’t you need to eat?” But deep down I hadn’t really meant that. If I’d wanted to voice what I really thought, I’d have said something like, I want out…. I need help…. I want someone to take me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those were dangerous thoughts, each one a brutal reminder of why I was here in the first place. “You.” I tugged at my arm. My life in Florida had sucked, sure, but it hadn’t been like this. This unending parade of terror and heartbreak. “This is your fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face fell, hearing my words. He knew what I meant, and still, he didn’t let go. He only pulled me closer. “Come with me,” he said, and this time his words were a soft lull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven through my thick coat, I felt the warmth begin to buzz from his fingertips. I stared at his hand nestled in the crook of my arm. “You’re doing your trick,” I said, though at that point, I didn’t even care. If it could put me out of my misery, I welcomed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and gave me a sad, halfhearted smile. “It seems an emergency, aye?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I said numbly, falling in to step beside him. “I’ll go with you. You don’t even need to do your special voodoo grip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked for a while, headed toward the cove where we’d had so many of our swim lessons. Finally, my curiosity got the better of me. “Where are you taking me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s where I go when I’m low.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. Whatever. I’d lost Amanda and Judge. Emma was dead in a way I presumed so horrific it’d been enough to make her boyfriend snap. Carden had disappeared off the face of the earth. And now Yasuo was transforming into a monster before my eyes. Maybe this little jaunt would make Ronan feel better, but I doubted I’d ever feel better again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-keep-the-watchers-4/page-26.html","bookId":2294,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM"}
