Must they be constantly challenging?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have nothing to learn about relationships. You have only to demonstrate what you already know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is a way to be happy in relationships, and that is to use relationships for their intended purpose, not the purpose you have designed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRelationships are constantly challenging; constantly calling you to create, express, and experience higher and higher aspects of yourself, grander and grander visions of yourself, ever more magnificent versions of yourself. Nowhere can you do this more immediately, impactfully, and immaculately than in relationships. In fact, without relationships, you cannot do it at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is only through your relationship with other peo-ple, places, and events that you can even exist (as a knowable quantity, as an identifiable something) in the universe. Remember, absent everything else, you are not. You only are what you are relative to another thing that is not. That is how it is in the world of the relative, as opposed to the world of the absolute—where I reside.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnce you clearly understand this, once you deeply grasp it, then you intuitively bless each and every experience, all human encounter, and especially per-sonal human relationships, for you see them as con-structive, in the highest sense. You see that they can be used, must be used, are being used (whether you want them to be or not) to construct Who You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat construction can be a magnificent creation of your own conscious design, or a strictly happenstance configuration. You can choose to be a person who has resulted simply from what has happened, or from what you’ve chosen to be and do about what has happened. It is in the latter form that creation of Self becomes conscious. It is in the second experience that Self becomes realized.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBless, therefore, every relationship, and hold each as special and formative of Who You Are—and now choose to be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow your inquiry has to do with individual human relationships of the romantic sort, and I understand that. So let Me address Myself specifically, and at length, to human love relationships—these things which continue to give you such trouble!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen human love relationships fail (relationships never truly fail, except in the strictly human sense that they did not produce what you want), they fail because they were entered into for the wrong reason.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e(“Wrong,” of course, is a relative term, meaning something measured against that which is “right”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e—whatever that is! It would be more accurate in your language to say “relationships fail—change—most often when they are entered into for reasons not wholly beneficial or conducive to their survival.”)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMost people enter into relationships with an eye toward what they can get out of them, rather than what they can put into them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of a relationship is to decide what part of yourself you’d like to see “show up,” not what part of another you can capture and hold.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere can be only one purpose for relation-ships—and for all of life: to be and to decide Who You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is very romantic to say that you were “nothing” until that special other came along, but it is not true. Worse, it puts an incredible pressure on the other to be all sorts of things he or she is not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot wanting to “let you down,” they try very hard to be and do these things until they cannot anymore. They can no longer complete your picture of them. They can no longer fill the roles to which they have been assigned. Resentment builds. Anger follows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, in order to save themselves (and the rela-tionship), these special others begin to reclaim their real selves, acting more in accordance with Who They Really Are. It is about this time that you say they’ve “really changed.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is very romantic to say that now that your special other has entered your life, you feel complete. Yet the purpose of relationship is not to have another who might complete you; but to have another with whom you might share your completeness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere is the paradox of all human relationships: You have no need for a particular other in order for you to experience, fully, Who You Are, and. . .without an-other, you are nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is both the mystery and the wonder, the frus-tration and the joy of the human experience. It requires deep understanding and total willingness to live within this paradox in a way which makes sense. I observe that very few people do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMost of you enter your relationship-forming years\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eripe with anticipation, full of sexual energy, a wide-open heart, and a joyful, if eager, soul.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere between 40 and 60 (and for most it is sooner rather than later) you’ve given up on your grandest dream, set aside your highest hope, and settled for your lowest expectation-or nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is so basic, so simple, and yet so tragically misunderstood: your grandest dream, your highest idea, and your fondest hope has had to do with your beloved other rather than your beloved Self. The test of your relationships has had to do with how well the other lived up to your ideas, and how well you saw yourself living up to his or hers. Yet the only true test has to do with how well you live up to yours.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRelationships are sacred because they provide life’s grandest opportunity—indeed, its only opportu-nity—to create and produce the experience of your highest conceptualization of Self. Relationships fail when you see them as life’s grandest opportunity to create and produce the experience of your highest conceptualization of another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet each person in relationship worry about Self—what Self is being, doing, and having; what Self is wanting, asking, giving; what Self is seeking, creating, experiencing, and all relationships would magnificently serve their purpose—and their participants!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet each person in relationship worry not about the other, but only, only, only about Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis seems a strange teaching, for you have been told that in the highest form of relationship, one worries only about the other. Yet I tell you this: your focus upon the other—your obsession with the other—is what causes relationships to fail.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the other being? What is the other doing?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the other having? What is the other saying?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWanting? Demanding? What is the other thinking?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExpecting? Planning?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master understands that it doesn’t matter what the other is being, doing, having, saying, wanting, de-manding. It doesn’t matter what the other is thinking, expecting, planning. It only matters what you are being in relationship to that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe most loving person is the person who is Self-centered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is a radical teaching.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot if you look at it carefully. If you cannot love your Self, you cannot love another. Many people make the mistake of seeking love of Self through love for another. Of course, they don’t realize they are doing this. It is not a conscious effort. It’s what’s going on in the mind. Deep in the mind. In what you call the subconscious.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey think: “If I can just love others, they will love me. Then I will be lovable, and I can love me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe reverse of this is that so many people hate themselves because they feel there is not another who loves them. This is a sickness—it’s when people are truly “lovesick” because the truth is, other people do love them, but it doesn’t matter. No matter how many people profess their love for them, it is not enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, they don’t believe you. They think you are trying to manipulate them—trying to get something. (How could you love them for who they truly are? No. There must be some mistake. You must want some-thing! Now what do you want?)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey sit around trying to figure out how anyone could actually love them. So they don’t believe you, and embark on a campaign to make you prove it. You have to prove that you love them. To do this, they may ask you to start altering your behavior.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSecond, if they finally come to a place where they can believe you love them, they begin at once to worry about how long they can keep your love. So, in order to hold onto your love, they start altering their behavior.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, two people literally lose themselves in a rela-tionship. They get into the relationship hoping to find themselves, and they lose themselves instead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis losing of the Self in a relationship is what causes most of the bitterness in such couplings.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTwo people join together in a partnership hoping that the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts, only to find that it’s less. They feel less than when they were single. Less capable, less able, less exciting, less attractive, less joyful, less content.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is because they are less. They’ve given up most of who they are in order to be—and to stay—in their relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRelationships were never meant to be this way. Yet this is how they are experienced by more people than you could ever know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is because people have lost touch with (if they ever were in touch with) the purpose of relationships.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you lose sight of each other as sacred souls on a sacred journey, then you cannot see the purpose, the reason, behind all relationships.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe soul has come to the body, and the body to life, for the purpose of evolution. You are evolving, you are becoming. And you are using your relationship with everything to decide what you are becoming.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the job you came here to do. This is the joy of creating Self. Of knowing Self. Of becoming, con-sciously, what you wish to be. It is what is meant by being Self conscious.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have brought your Self to the relative world so that you might have the tools with which to know and expe-rience Who You Really Are. Who You Are is who you create yourself to be in relationship to all the rest of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour personal relationships are the most important elements in this process. Your personal relationships are therefore holy ground. They have virtually nothing to do with the other, yet, because they involve another, they have everything to do with the other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the divine dichotomy. This is the closed circle. So it is not such a radical teaching to say, “Blessed are the Self-centered, for they shall know God.” It might not be a bad goal in your life to know the highest part of your Self, and to stay centered in that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour first relationship, therefore, must be with your Self. You must first learn to honor and cherish and love your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou must first see your Self as worthy before you can see another as worthy. You must first see your Self as blessed before you can see another as blessed. You must first know your Self to be holy before you can acknow-ledge holiness in another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you put the cart before the horse—as most relig-ions ask you to do—and acknowledge another as holy before you acknowledge yourself, you will one day resent it. If there is one thing none of you can tolerate, it is someone being holier than thou. Yet your religions force you to call others holier than thou. And so you do it—for a while. Then you crucify them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have crucified (in one way or another) all of My teachers, not just One. And you did so not because they were holier than thou, but because you made them out to be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy teachers have all come with the same message. Not “I am holier than thou,” but “You are as holy as am I.,,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the message you have not been able to hear; this is the truth you have not been able to accept. And that is why you can never truly, purely, fall in love with another. You have never truly, purely fallen in love with your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I tell you this: be now and forever centered upon your Self. Look to see what you are being, doing, and having in any given moment, not what’s going on with another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is not in the action of another, but in your re-action, that your salvation will be found.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI know better, but somehow this makes it sound as though we should not mind what others do to us in relationships. They can do anything, and so long as we hold our equilibrium, keep our Self centered, and all that good stuff, nothing can touch us. But others do touch us. Their actions do sometimes hurt us. It is when the hurt comes into relationships that I don’t know what to do. It’s all very well to say “stand aside from it; cause it to mean nothing,” but that’s easier said than done. I do get hurt by the words and actions of others in relationships.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe day will come when you will not. That will be the day on which you realize—and actualize—the true meaning of relationships; the true reason for them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is because you have forgotten this that you react the way you do. But that is alright. That is part of the growth process. It is part of evolution. It is Soul Work you are up to in relationship, yet that is a grand under-standing, a grand remembering. Until you remember this—and remember then also how to use relationship as a tool in the creation of Self—you must work at the level at which you are. The level of understanding, the level of willingness, the level of remembrance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so there are things you can do when you react with pain and hurt to what another is being, saying, or doing. The first is to admit honestly to yourself and to another exactly how you are feeling. This many of you are afraid to do, because you think it will make you “look bad.” Somewhere, deep inside of you, you realize that it probably is ridiculous for you to “feel that way.” It probably is small of you. You are “bigger than that.” But you can’t help it. You still feel that way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one thing you can do. You must honor your feelings. For honoring your feelings means honor-ing your Self. And you must love your neighbor as you love yourself. How can you ever expect to understand and honor the feelings of another if you cannot honor the feelings within your Self?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe first question in any interactive process with another is: now Who Am I, and Who Do I Want to Be, in relationship to that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOften you do not remember Who You Are, and do not know Who You Want to Be until you try out a few ways of being. That is why honoring your truest feelings is so important.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf your first feeling is a negative feeling, simply having the feeling is frequently all that is needed to step away from it. It is when you have the anger, have the upset, have the disgust, have the rage, own the feeling of wanting to “hurt back,” that you can disown these first feelings as “not Who You Want to Be.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master is one who has lived through enough such experiences to know in advance what her final choices are. She does not need to “try out” anything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe’s worn these clothes before and knows they do not fit; they are not “her.” And since a Master’s life is devoted to the constant realization of Self as one knows oneself to be, such ill-fitting feelings would never be entertained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is why Masters are imperturbable in the face of what others might call calamity. A Master blesses calam-ity, for the Master knows that from the seeds of disaster (and all experience) comes the growth of Self. And the Master’s second life purpose is alwaysgrowth. For once one has fully Self realized, there is nothing left to do except be more of that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is at this stage that one moves from soul work to God work, for this is what I am up to!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI will assume for the purposes of this discussion that you are still up to soul work. You are still seeking to realize (make “real”) Who You Truly Are. Life (I) will give you bountiful opportunities to create that (remember, life is not a process of discovery, life is a process of creation).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can create Who You Are over and over again. Indeed, you do—every day. As things now stand, you do not always come up with the same answer, however. Given an identical outer experience, on day one you may choose to be patient, loving, and kind in relationship to it. On day two you may choose to be angry, ugly, and sad.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master is one who always comes up with the same answer—and that answer is always the highest choice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn this the Master is imminently predictable. Con-versely, the student is completely unpredictable. One can tell how one is doing on the road to mastery by simply noticing how predictably one makes the highest choice in responding or reacting to any situation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this throws open the question, what choice is highest?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is a question around which have revolved the philosophies and theologies of man since the beginning of time. If the question truly engages you, you are already on your way to mastery. For it is still true that most people continue to be engaged by another ques-tion altogether. Not, what is the highest choice, but, what is the most profitable? Or, how can I lose the least?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen life is lived from a standpoint of damage control or optimum advantage, the true benefit of life is forfeited. The opportunity is lost. The chance is missed. For a life lived thusly is a life lived from fear—and that life speaks a lie about you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor you are not fear, you are love. Love that needs no protection, love that cannot be lost. Yet you will never know this in your experience if you continually answer the second question and not the first. For only a person who thinks there is something to gain or to lose asks the second question. And only a person who sees life in a different way; who sees Self as a higher being; who understands that winning or losing is not the test, but only loving or failing to love—only that person asks the first.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe who asks the second question says, “I am my body.” She who asks the first says, “I am my soul.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYea, let all those who have ears to hear, listen. For I tell you this: at the critical juncture in all human rela-tionships, there is only one question:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat would love do now?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo other question is relevant, no other question is meaningful, no other question has any importance to your soul.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow we come upon a very delicate point of inter-pretation, for this principle of love-sponsored action has been widely misunderstood—and it is this misun-derstanding which has led to the resentments and angers of life—which, in turn, have caused so many to stray from the path.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor centuries you have been taught that love-spon-sored action arises out of the choice to be, do, and have whatever produces the highest good for another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet I tell you this: the highest choice is that which produces the highest good for you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs with all profound spiritual truth, this statement opens itself to immediate misinterpretation. The mys-tery clears a bit the moment one decides what is the highest “good” one could do for oneself. And when the absolute highest choice is made, the mystery dissolves, the circle completes itself, and the highest good for you becomes the highest good for another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt may take lifetimes to understand this—and even more lifetimes to implement—for this truth revolves around an even greater one: What you do for your Self, you do for another. What you do for another, you do for the Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is because you and the other are one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is because...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is naught but You.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll the Masters who have walked your planet have taught this. (“Verily, verily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto Me.”) Yet this has remained for most people merely a grand esoteric truth, with little practical application. In fact, it is the most practically applicable “esoteric” truth of all time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is important in relationships to remember this truth, for without it relationships will be very difficult.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet’s go back to the practical applications of this wisdom and step away from the purely spiritual, eso-teric aspect of it for now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo often, under the old understandings, peo-ple—well-meaning and well-intentioned and many very religious—did what they thought would be best for the other person in their relationships. Sadly, all this produced in many cases (in most cases) was continued abuse by the other. Continued mistreatment. Contin-ued dysfunction in the relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the person trying to “do what is right” by the other—to be quick to forgive, to show com-passion, to continually look past certain problems and behaviors—becomes resentful, angry, and mis-trusting, even of God. For how can a just God de-mand such unending suffering, joylessness, and sacrifice, even in the name of love?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is, Cod does not. God asks only that you include yourself among those you love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod goes further. God suggests—recommends— that you put yourself first.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI do this knowing full well that some of you will call this blasphemy, and therefore not My word, and that others of you will do what might be even worse: accept it as My word and misinterpret or distort it to suit your own purposes; to justify unGodly acts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI tell you this—putting yourself first in the highest sense never leads to an unGodly act.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf, therefore, you have caught yourself in an unGodly act as a result of doing what is best for you, the confusion is not in having put yourself first, but rather in misun-derstanding what is best for you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, determiningwhat is bestfor you will require you to also determine what it is you are trying to do. This is an important step that many people ignore. What are you “up to”? What is your purpose in life? Without answers to these questions, the matter of what is “best” in any given circumstances will remain a mystery.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs a practical matter—again leaving esoterics aside—if you look to what is best for you in these situations where you are being abused, at the very least what you will do is stop the abuse. And that will be good for both you and your abuser. For even an abuser is abused when his abuse is allowed to continue.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is not healing to the abuser, but damaging. For if the abuser finds that his abuse is acceptable, what has he learned? Yet if the abuser finds that his abuse will be accepted no more, what has he been allowed to discover?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, treating others with love does not neces-sarily mean allowing others to do as they wish.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eParents learn this early with children. Adults are not so quick to learn it with other adults, nor nation with nation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet despots cannot be allowed to flourish, but must be stopped in their despotism. Love of Self, and love of the despot, demands it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the answer to your question, “If love is all there is, how can man ever justify war?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSometimes man must go to war to make the grandest statement about who man truly is: he who abhors war.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are times when you may have to give up Who You Are in order to be Who You Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are Masters who have taught: you cannot have it all until you are willing to give it all up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, in order to “have” yourself as a man of peace, you may have to give up the idea of yourself as a man who never goes to war. History has called upon men for such decisions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe same is true in the most individual and the most personal relationships. Life may more than once call upon you to prove Who You Are by demonstrating an aspect of Who You Are Not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is notsodifficultto understand if you have lived a few years, though for the idealistically young it may seem the ultimate contradiction. In more mature retro-spection it seems more divine dichotomy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis does not mean in human relationships that if you are being hurt, you have to “hurt back.” (Nor does it mean so in relationships between nations.) It simply means that to allow another to continually inflict dam-age may not be the most loving thing to do—for your Self or the other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis should put to rest some pacifist theories that highest love requires no forceful response to what you consider evil.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe discussion here turns esoteric once more, because no serious exploration of this statement can ignore the word “evil,” and the value judgments it invites. In truth, there is nothing evil, only objective phenomena and experience. Yet your very purpose in life requires you to select from the growing collec-tion of endless phenomena a scattered few which you call evil—for unless you do, you cannot call yourself, nor anything else, good—and thus cannot know, or create, your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy that which you call evil do you define your-self—and by that which you call good.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest evil would therefore be to declare nothing evil at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou exist in this life in the world of the relative, where one thing can exist only insofar as it relates to another. This is at one and the same time both the function and the purpose of relationship: to provide a field of experience within which you find yourself, define yourself, and—if you choose-constantly recre-ate Who You Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eChoosing to be God-like does not mean you choose to be a martyr. And it certainly does not mean you choose to be a victim.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn your way to mastery—when all posibility of hurt, damage, and loss is eliminated—it would be well to recognize hurt, damage, and loss as part of your experi-ence, and decide Who You Are in relationship to it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, the things that others think, say, or do will sometimes hurt you—until they do not anymore. What will get you from here to there most quickly is total honesty—being willing to assert, acknowledge, and declare exactly how you feel about a thing. Say your truth—kindly, but fully and completely. Live your truth, gently, but totally and consistently. Change your truth easily and quickly when your experience brings you new clarity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo one in right mind, least of all God, would tell you, when you are hurt in a relationship, to “stand aside from it, cause it to mean nothing.” If you are now hurting, it is too late to cause it to mean nothing. Your task now is to decide what it does mean—and to demonstrate that. For in so doing, you choose and become Who You Seek to Be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo I don’t have to be the long-suffering wife or the belittled husband or the victim of my relationships in order to render them holy, or to make me pleasing in the eyes of God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGood grief, of course not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don’t have to put up with attacks on my dignity, assaults on my pride, damage to my psyche, and wounds to my heart in order to say that I “gave it my best” in a relationship; “did my duty” or “met my obligation” in the eyes of God and man.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot for one minute.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen, pray God, tell me—what promises should I make in relationship; what agreements must I keep?

Why all this struggle for me to “overcome” who I am in order for me to become what God wants me to be? This the probing mind demands to know—and rightly so, for it is a proper inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe religionists would have you believe that I cre-ated you as less than Who I Am so that you could have the chance to become as Who I Am, working against all odds—and, I might add, against every natural tendency I am supposed to have given you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmong these so-called natural tendencies is the tendency to sin. You are taught that you were born in sin, that you will die in sin, and that to sin is your nature.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne of your religions even teaches you that you can do nothing about this. Your own actions are irrelevant and meaningless. It is arrogant to think that by some action of yours you can “get to heaven.” There is only one way to heaven (salvation) and that is through no undertaking of your own, but through the grace granted you by God through acceptance of His Son as your intermediary.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnce this is done you are “saved.” Until it is done, nothing that you do-not the life you live, not the choices you make, not anything you undertake of your own will in an effort to improve yourself or render you worthy—has any effect, bears any influence.

You are saying that My Son—who you call the One Perfect One—has saved you from your own imperfection—the imperfection I gave you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, God’s Son has saved you from what His Father did.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is how you—many of you—say I’ve set it up.

So it’s very difficult to hear what you’re saying, because I’m aware that it plays to my ego, and I’ve spent all my life fighting my ego.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI know you have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd sometimes not too successfully.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am chagrined to have to agree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet always when it has come to Cod, you have let the ego drop.
