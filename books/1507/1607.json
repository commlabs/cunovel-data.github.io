The entire starry sky outside the Vast Expanse was shaking violently. In fact, even the inner starry sky seemed on the verge of collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s pupils constricted. He knew that Allheaven was getting very anxious in his attempt to force the usage of his Seal the Heavens Hex, and was obviously willing to pay the highest of prices to do so. However, as of this moment, Meng Hao knew that if he didn’t use that Hex, he would definitely... die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Transcendors could be killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to see it? Fine. I’ll show you.... my Ninth Hex. The Seal the Heavens Hex!” His eyes shone with radiant light, like that of the sun and moon. He took a deep breath, and the starry sky around him began to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretched his arms out, and everything around him shattered. At the same time, a statue appeared in front of him, as well as a sword!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statue shone with dazzling light that filled the starry sky. It slowly lifted the sword, a sword both ancient and bizarre, something filled with power that didn’t seem appropriate within the starry sky. That was because... its power exceeded the entire starry sky’s capacity to contain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statue and the sword were causing everything outside the Vast Expanse to shake violently. At the same time, Meng Hao’s three opponents seemed to fade slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight spilled out from within the statue and, with Meng Hao at the center, surged out in all directions. In the blink of an eye, it filled everything in existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as the darkness was driven away. Outside the Vast Expanse, everything was shining brightly. The light was so bright that it even pierced the barriers to shine inside the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn indescribably domineering will was rising up from the statue, and from Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a domineering air that said, \u003cem\u003eWhat I want, the Heavens shall NOT lack! What I don\u0027t want, had BETTER not exist in the Heavens!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a madness that said, \u003cem\u003eMy words are reality!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light almost seemed to be peeling off a layer of skin that existed within the starry sky. The three powerful figures from Allheaven’s memories were rapidly fading away, and their divine abilities seemed to be on the verge of vanishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire starry sky was filled with explosive rumbling sounds. This was Meng Hao’s Seal the Heavens Hex, his most powerful Daoist magic, his trump card!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the boundless light shone out, Meng Hao dropped his left hand and pushed up with his right, stretching it high into the starry sky. Everything shook, and all of the boundless light began to converge on his hand. In the blink of an eye, a character came to be visible there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the character “seal!” 封\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, an indescribably powerful gravitational force appeared, causing all natural and magical laws, all entities, all wills, to be uncontrollably sucked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starry sky was in complete chaos, and Meng Hao’s three powerful opponents were starting to shake. Strange light could be seen in their eyes, as, without any hesitation, they continued to propel their divine abilities toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost talons brimmed with energy. A Devilish death aura shook everything. The God Dao sent boundless magical flames surging out. The power almost instantly threatened to overwhelm Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, Meng Hao’s eyes glittered, and he quietly said, “Seal the Heavens Hex!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the “seal” character began to expand, shining with scintillating light, causing intense rumbling sounds to fill the starry sky. The character grew larger and larger, until it was so large that it seemed big enough to seal all the Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, it slammed into the Daoist magics of the three Transcendors!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEar-splitting crashing could be heard as the Ghost’s divine ability was crushed and transformed into ash, which was then sucked into the “seal” character. The exact same thing happened to the Devil’s possession power, and the God’s powerful magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese incomplete Daoist magics could not stand up at all to the Seal the Heavens Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of all three Transcendors seemed to fill with madness as they transformed into three beams of Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering light. All of them called upon the power of their own Essences to fly at top speed toward the “seal” character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, they all collided, and the starry sky was shaken so violently it seemed as if it might explode. The three Transcendors’ bodies twisted and distorted as though they were being blasted by a wind of destruction that was wiping them out of existence. At the same time, the intense power of their attack caused cracks to appear on the constantly expanding “seal” character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven still, the three Transcendors were shoved backward; no matter how Allheaven struggled to force them into action, the power of the Seal the Heavens Hex could not be resisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became a wild wind that swept over everything. Meng Hao’s eyes were bloodshot, and a powerful roar erupted from his mouth as he sealed everything present. The three Transcendors were not their true selves, but rather, duplicates created by Allheaven. They had incomplete Daoist magics, and were themselves incomplete. Because of that, blood sprayed out of their mouths, and they trembled on the verge of being destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, something like a roar of fury echoed out as the three Transcendors exploded!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eighth Allheaven Transformation had been completely broken by the Seal the Heavens Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three Transcendors became black threads that, despite the power of the Seal the Heavens Hex, converged together into the vague shape of an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the eye of the Allheaven, glaring furiously at Meng Hao, completely bloodshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng... Hao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the muffled voice filled the starry sky, Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with killing intent, and he waved his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword which had appeared moments ago slashed down, and the starry sky was rent asunder. A gargantuan, boundless gash ripped open, snaking out at top speed toward the eye of Allheaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it slammed into the eye, the eye was slashed in half. The power of the sword was boundlessly domineering, shockingly sharp, capable of piercing through anything. It sailed through the starry sky, its true target being one of the two pillars that seemed to prop up all existence, the pillar representing the Demon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t pause for even a moment before directly slashing into the pillar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, it had been countless years ago that the Ghost destroyed one of the pillars. Later, the Devil destroyed a second pillar, and the God, a third. Now Meng Hao was using the Seal the Heavens Hex…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo destroy the fourth pillar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOOOOOOMMM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1604: Destroying Allheaven’s Finger!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck here for the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/i-shall-seal-the-heavens-grande-finale-commenting-contest/\"\u003econtest rules\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse the hashtag #ISSTH on twitter!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winners for \"Best Comment\" will be announced along with the raffle winners some time after the contest!
