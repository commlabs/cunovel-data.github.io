We are to honor Him in the trial--in that which is an affliction indeed and though there have been cases where God did not let His saints feel the fire, yet, ordinarily, fire hurts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut just here we are to glorify Him by our perfect faith in His goodness and love that has permitted all this to come upon us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd more than that, we are to believe that out of this is coming something more for His praise than could have come but for this fiery trial.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe can only go through some fires with a large faith; little faith will fail. We must have the victory in the furnace. --Margaret Bottome.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA man has as much religion as he can show in times of trouble. The men who were cast into the fiery furnace came out as they went in--except their bonds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow often in some furnace of affliction God strikes them off! Their bodies were unhurt--their skin not even blistered. Their hair was unsinged, their garments not scorched, and even the smell of fire had not passed upon them. And that is the way Christians should come out of furnace trials--liberated from their bonds, but untouched by the flames.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Triumphing over them in it.\" (Col. 2:15)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is the real triumph--triumphing over sickness, in it; triumphing over death, dying; triumphing over adverse circumstances, in them. Oh, believe me, there is a power that can make us victors in the strife. There are heights to be reached where we can look down and over the way we have come, and sing our song of triumph on this side of Heaven. We can make others regard us as rich, while we are poor, and make many rich in our poverty. Our triumph is to be in it. Christ\u0027s triumph was in His humiliation. Possibly our triumph, also, is to be made manifest in what seems to others humiliation. --Margaret Bottome.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs there not something captivating in the sight of a man or a woman burdened with many tribulations and yet carrying a heart as sound as a bell? Is there not something contagiously valorous in the vision of one who is greatly tempted, but is more than conqueror? Is it not heartening to see some pilgrim who is broken in body, but who retains the splendor of an unbroken patience? What a witness all this offers to the enduement of His grace! --J. H.
