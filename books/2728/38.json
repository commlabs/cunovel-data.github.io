We’ve eaten outside every single night, a gourmet meal with fresh seafood, on a big banquet table draped with white linen tablecloths. There’s a chef working all day for us, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desserts, while we f**k around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it would take some getting used to, this kind of life. But it hasn’t. Like the whiskey, it’s going down really, really easy. And I’m kind of bummed that this is my one and only spring break trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yo, Kat. Look what we found!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head and see PJ walking over in a button-up shirt and board shorts, mirrored sunglasses hiding his eyes. He’s holding a wooden box. Jonah, one of Alex’s chorus friends, comes up beside him and lifts the lid, like a game show hostess showing off a prize. Inside are neat stacks of brown cigars, each one encircled with an ornate gold foil band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up and pull on my cutoffs. “Holy shit. Are you serious? Another box of Cubans?” I haven’t smoked a cigarette for three weeks now, but I’ve made a spring break exception for a Cuban. Several spring break exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Tim must have just come back from Havana,” Derek says. He takes out two, cuts the tips with a silver clip monogrammed with Uncle Tim’s initials, and passes around a lighter. “Yo, Al! You want one too, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex comes up from the kitchen, followed by one of the hired boat staff carrying a tray in his hands loaded with four tumblers of whiskey and perfect square ice cubes. I quickly drain the glass I’m holding and then trade my empty for a fresh one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The chef is making some sick crab cakes! Should be ready in an hour, guys,” he announces. After taking a few big gulps of his whiskey, he says to us, “What do you say we never go back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he’s smiling, I know there’s truth behind those words. This has been an escape for Alex, to not have to see Reeve and Lillia together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way it’s been an escape for me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight after we set sail, I regretted saying yes. First off, sailing on any boat when Judy Blue Eyes is gone depressed the shit out of me. And, as I expected, it was awkward on board for the first few days. We were definitely divided along class lines. Alex’s chorus friends mostly hung out up on the deck, while the rest of us were in the lounge. Jonah spent the whole first night shuffling his magic cards, and Ivan didn’t do much but stare down at his bongos and pat them quietly. Brianna, the girl who did the Christmas duet with Alex, has followed him around like a lovesick puppy. It was basically my worst fears come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut things took a turn when the captain found us a cove between some tiny sand islands, and the water was warm like a bath. Everyone took turns jumping off the bow into the water, even Ashlin, which impressed the shit out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was really all it took for us to be cool with each other. That night everyone hung out on the deck together. Ivan played his bongos, and PJ and Derek made up a rap, which was pretty decent for a freestyle and had me laughing my ass off. Ashlin had Brianna putting braids in her hair. And Alex, bless his heart, kept sitting between me and Jonah, because dude had his eyes on my boobs, like, 24/7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, not a bad time. In fact, it’s been pretty great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my escape? I’m always so quick to shit on things . . . people, experiences, different points of view. I get it set in my head that things are a certain way, and then I shut out anything that might contradict that perception. Except I couldn’t pull that shit on this boat, and I’m better for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go downstairs to shower and change for dinner. Ashlin is in the room, getting into this flowy caftan thing, and Brianna has on a 1950s housedress. I don’t have anything dressy to wear for our last meal, so I put on my black tank dress. I should seriously get new clothes before I head to Oberlin. I mean, if I get in. That acceptance letter better be waiting for me when I get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlin comes up behind me with a scarf. It’s got a cool trippy pattern on it. She ties it around my head like I’m some kind of seventies rock star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should totally wear a look like this to prom! Something vintage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProm. See? Another one of those things that I’ve shit on. Why shouldn’t I go to prom? I’m a freaking senior, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh looks over at Brianna. “Did you buy your dress yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, not yet,” Brianna says. “I’m not sure if I’m going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s crazy! You have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in this show at the regional playhouse, and I had to buy my own costume. So I doubt I’ll have the money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Ash says, and I can tell she feels like a dummy. “Well, that stinks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no big deal,” Brianna says, lowering her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” I say. “Prom tickets are that expensive?” If they are, I probably can’t go either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are this year,” Brianna explains. “It’s going to be at some club in Boston.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a dumb idea.” I turn and look at Ash. “Who’s making these bonehead decisions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh points her finger at me. “Don’t even. You have no right to complain. If you care, then come to a prom committee meeting. Don’t just bitch about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. Ash has some fire in her. “Okay, okay. Down, girl.” I smile at her, and she smiles back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s crazy, the things that have happened this year. How much I’ve changed. How everything that I thought was set in stone isn’t. It makes me excited for the future and all its possibilities. Anything can happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I have the overwhelming urge to talk to Mary. I want to tell her how much better life gets, if you give it a chance. I want to tell her to let go of the Reeve drama once and for all. I want to tell her that I miss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLILLIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN THE CAR ON THE way to the restaurant, I smooth down the skirt of my silk dress and say, “Daddy, please be nice to Reeve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and my mom exchange a look. “I’m always nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the backseat Nadia and I exchange a look of our own. “Not true, Daddy,” she says in a singsong voice. “When you met James, you gave him the third degree about drinking and driving. And, hello, we don’t even have our licenses yet! Now James is afraid to come over to the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad hides a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give Nadia a grateful look, and then she remembers she’s supposed to be giving me the silent treatment, and she turns her head back toward the window. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-38.html","bookId":2728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM"}
