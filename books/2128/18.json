A contingent of well armed drow had come to the Isle of Rothe, demanding answers, interrogating both the orc and goblin slaves and the few drow slavers on the island. They wore no house emblems and, as far as Khareesa could tell, were exclusively males.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did not stop them from treating her roughly, though, with\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;out the proper protocol typically afforded her gender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" the drow asked aloud. The unexpected noise brought two of the male\u0027s comrades rushing to his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is gone, \" the male explained to calm his companions, \"into the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he is on his way back, a fourth drow replied in the silent hand code as he rushed to join the others. We just received the code flashes from the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heightening intrigue was more than curious Khareesa could take. \"1 am Khareesa H\u0027kar, \" she proclaimed, naming herself a noble of one of the city\u0027s lesser houses, but a noble nonetheless. \"Who is this male you speak of? And why is he so important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four males looked to each other slyly, and the newcomer turned an evil glare on Khareesa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have heard of Daermon N\u0027a\u0027shezbaernon?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhareesa nodded. Of course she had heard of the powerful house, House Do\u0027Urden by its more common name. It had once been the eighth ranked house in all the city, but had met a disastrous end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of their secondboy?\" the male went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhareesa pursed her lips, unsure. She tried to remember the tragic story of House Do\u0027Urden, something about a renegade, when another of the males jogged her memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, \" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhareesa started to nod, she had heard the name before, in passing, then her eyes went wide as she realized the significance of the handsome, purple eyed drow that had left the Isle of Rothe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is a witness, one of the males reasoned. She was not, argued another, until we told her the renegade\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now she is, \" said the first, and they looked in unison at the female.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhareesa had long caught on to their wicked game and was steadily backing away from them, sword and whip in hand. She stopped as she felt the tip of yet another sword gently prod her fine armor from behind, and she held her hands out wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"House H\u0027kar, \" she began, but abruptly ended as the drow behind her plunged his fabulous drow made sword through the fine armor and through a kidney. Khareesa jerked as the male yanked the weapon back out. She slumped to one knee, trying to hold her concentration against the sudden assault of agony, trying to hold fast to her weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four soldiers fell over her. There could be no witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s gaze remained toward the strangely lighted city as the raft slipped slowly across Donigarten\u0027s dark waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorches? The thought hung heavily in his mind, for he had pretty much convinced himself that the drow were preparing a huge excursion to the surface. Why else would they be stinging their sensitive eyes so?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the raft floated across the weedy bay of the Isle of Rothe,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Drizzt noticed that no other craft were docked at the island. He gave it little thought as he climbed over the prow and sprang lightly to the mossy beach. The orcs had barely put up their oars when another drow whisked past Drizzt and sprang into the boat, order\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing the slave crew to put back out for the mainland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrc rothe herders congregated by the shore, each squatting in the mossy muck, ragged cloaks pulled tight. This was not unusual,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for there was really little for them to do. The isle was not large,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;barely a hundred yards long and less than that in width, but it was incredibly thick with low vegetation, mainly mosses and fungi. The landscape was broken, filled with valleys and steep sloping hillocks, and the biggest job facing the orcs, aside from taking rothe from the isle to the mainland and chasing down strays, was simply to make sure that none of the herd fell into any ravines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the slaves sat down by the shore, silent and brooding. They seemed somewhat edgy to Drizzt, but, consumed by his fears over what was happening in the city, he again gave it little thought. He did glance about to the drow slaver posts, and took comfort in the fact that all the dark elves were apparently in place, standing quietly and calmly. The Isle of Rothe was not an eventful place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt headed straight inland, away from the small bay and toward the highest point on the island. Here stood the isle\u0027s lone structure, a small, two chambered house constructed of gigantic mushroom stalks. He considered his strategy as he moved, thought of how he might get the necessary information from Khareesa without open confrontation. Events seemed to be moving quickly about him, though, and he resolved that if he had to use his scimi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tars to \"convince\" her, he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely ten feet from the structure\u0027s door, Drizzt stopped and watched as the portal gently swung in. A drow soldier stepped to the threshold and casually tossed Khareesa\u0027s severed head at Drizzt\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no way off the island, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, \" the drow remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt didn\u0027t turn his head, but shifted his eyes, trying to get a clear measure of his surroundings. He inconspicuously worked one toe under the soft moss, burying his foot to the ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll accept your surrender, \" the drow went on. \"You cannot, \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow stopped abruptly as a wad of moss flew at his face. He snapped out his sword and instinctively threw his hands up before him in defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s charge followed the moss divot. The ranger sprang across the ten feet to his enemy, then dropped in a deceptive spin,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pivoting on one planted knee. Using his momentum, Drizzt sent Twinkle in a wicked, low cut that caught the surprised drow on the side of the knee. The drow turned a complete somersault over that stinging hit, striking the soft ground with a thud and a cry of pain as he clutched at his ripped leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt sensed that other dark elves were in the house behind this one, so he was up and running quickly, around the structure and out of sight of the door, then down the hillock\u0027s steep back slope. He dove, skidded, and rolled to build momentum, his thoughts a jumble, his desperation mounting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral dozen rothe milled about the mossy bank, and they bleated and grunted as Drizzt scrambled among them. Drizzt heard several clicks behind him, heard a hand crossbow quarrel slap into one rothe. The creature tumbled, asleep before it hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt kept low, scrambling, trying to figure where he could run. He had been on the island only a short time, had never been here in his earlier years in the city, and wasn\u0027t familiar with its land\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;scape. He knew that this hillock dropped into a steep ravine,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though, and thought that was his best chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore shots came from behind; a javelin joined the quarrels. Muck and divots flew wildly as the rothe, frightened by the rushing dark elf and missiles, kicked about, threatening to stampede. They were not large creatures, only three feet high at the shoulder, but were solidly built. If caught on his hands and knees in the midst of a rothe stampede, Drizzt knew he would be crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis problems compounded as he neared the back of the rothe herd, for between the legs of one creature he spotted boots. Hardly thinking, Drizzt lifted his shoulder and barreled sidelong into the rothe, pushing it down the slope, into his enemy. One scimitar went up high and sang as it struck a descending sword; another scimitar jabbed low, under the rothe\u0027s belly, but the enemy drow hopped back, out of range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt coiled his legs under him and heaved with all his strength, using the ground\u0027s fairly steep angle to his advantage. The rothe lifted off the ground and skipped sidelong, slamming the drow. He was agile enough to lift a leg over the creature\u0027s low back and come cleanly over it, spinning about in an attempt to face Drizzt squarely. But Drizzt was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bleat to the side was the only warning the drow got as the fierce ranger rushed in, scimitars flashing. The surprised drow threw both his swords out in front as he spun about, barely deflect\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing the scimitar cuts. One foot skidded out from under him, but he came back up quickly, fire in his eyes and his swords thrusting wildly, holding Drizzt at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt moved quickly to the right, gained the higher ground again, though he knew that that move would put his back to the archers at the top of the hillock. He kept his scimitars moving, his eyes focused ahead, but listened to sounds from the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sword darted in low, was caught by Twinkle and held down. A second thrust came in parallel to the first but a bit higher, and Drizzt\u0027s second scimitar responded, coming unexpectedly straight across, angling the drow\u0027s sword right for Drizzt\u0027s low arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt heard a slight whistle behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy drow flashed a wicked grin, thinking he was about to score a hit as the blades flashed across, but Drizzt sent Twinkle in motion as well, equally fast, taking the drow\u0027s sword arm with him in the wide flying move. Drizzt swept the scimitars under and up,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;using their curving blades to keep the swords moving in line. He turned a complete circuit, moving the blades high above his head and moving himself one step to the side of the enemy drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis trust in the unseen archer\u0027s skill was not misplaced, and his melee opponent jerked his hips to the side in a frantic effort to dodge the javelin. He took a stinging hit and grimaced in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt heaved him away, sent him skidding down the slope. The drow caught his balance as the ranger descended over him in a wild rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimitar batted sword again and again and again. Drizzt\u0027s sec\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ond scimitar worked a more direct and devious pattern, thrusting and angling for the drow\u0027s belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wounded drow\u0027s parries were impressive against the onslaught, but with one leg numb from pain, he was backing up and inevitably building momentum. He managed to glance back and noticed one spur of stone rising above the ledge of the twenty foot sheer drop. He thought to make for that spur and put his back against it for support. His allies were rushing down the slope; they would be beside him in a matter of seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds he didn\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth scimitars came in rapid succession, beating against the steel of the drow\u0027s swords, forcing him down the hill. Near the drop, Drizzt launched his weapons simultaneously, side by side, in crossing cuts, turning the tips of his enemy\u0027s swords. Then Drizzt launched himself, slamming against the drow\u0027s chest, knocking him off balance to crash against the rocky spur. Explosions went off in the dazed drow\u0027s head. He slumped to the moss, knowing that this renegade, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, and his wicked scimitars would be right behind..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt hadn\u0027t the time or the desire to complete the kill. Before the drow finished collapsing, Drizzt had leaped over the ledge, hop\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing to find moss and not sharp rocks, below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he found was mud, and he hit with a splash, turning an ankle, then turning a somersault. He finally hauled himself out and ran off as fast as he could, zigzagging around stalagmite pillars,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;keeping low to the cover of the mounds, for he expected that the archers would soon be at the ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnemies were all about him, and very close, he realized, seeing a form paralleling him along a stalagmite row to his right. Drizzt went behind one mound and, instead of coming out the other side,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;veered to meet his enemy head on. He dropped to his knees as he came behind the second mound, slashing across low in the expecta\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tion that his enemy would be back there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwinkle hit a low riding sword this time. Drizzt had not gained surprise, not with his maneuver, at least, but the drow was certainly off guard, his second sword high for a strike, when Drizzt snapped his second scimitar straight up, quicker than his enemy could antici\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pate. The pointed tip punctured the drow\u0027s diaphragm, and though Drizzt, as he continued his slide, could not extend his arm enough to complete the move, the drow fell back against the stalagmite, out of the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ally was right behind him, though, and this soldier fell upon the kneeling Drizzt with abandon, swords hacking fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePure instinct kept the darting blades from Drizzt as the ranger worked his scimitars over his head, feeling more than seeing his opponent\u0027s moves. Understanding his sudden disadvantage, Drizzt called upon his innate magic and summoned a globe of darkness over himself and his enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRinging steel continued to sound, weapons meeting and slid\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing, with both combatants taking nicks. Drizzt growled and increased his intensity, parrying and countering, still slashing up oYer his head. Gradually, the skilled ranger shifted his weight to get one foot under him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy drow came with a sudden and fierce double chop,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and nearly fell over when his blades caught nothing but air. He spun immediately, whipping his swords across, and nearly lost both blades as they slammed the side of the stony stalagmite mound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the heat of battle, he had forgotten the layout of the immedi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ate area, forgotten the mound not so far away. The drow had heard the reputation of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and suddenly understood the magnitude of his mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt, perched high on a rounded shoulder of the mound,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;winced as he heard the swords connect with stone below him, tak\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing little satisfaction in this action. He couldn\u0027t see Twinkle\u0027s flaring blue light as the scimitar descended through the darkness globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran free a moment later, his ankle still sore but supporting him. He came out the back side of the ravine and moved up on the ledge opposite the high hillock. The ledge ran toward the more remote eastern end of the isle. There lay a lagoon, Drizzt believed,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not so far away, and if he could reach it, he intended to dive right in. Damn the legends of monsters in the water; the enemies about him were all too real!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie heard the continuing scuffles from the isle. The sounds drifted clearly across the still, dark waters of Donigarten. From behind the stalk of one mushroom, she called up Guenhwyvar and ran off as the mist took its solid form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the lake, the young woman, still not confident of her drow disguise, avoided the few dark elves that were about and motioned to a nearby orc instead. Then she motioned to a boat, trying to indi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;cate that the creature should take her out to the isle. The orc seemed nervous, or at least confused. It turned away and started to walk off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie punched it in the back of the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCowering, obviously terrified, it turned about to face her. Catti\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;brie shoved it toward the small boat, and this time the creature got in and took up a paddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could join the orc, Catti-brie was intercepted by a male drow, his strong hand closing tightly over her elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed him dangerously and growled, trying to bluff once again, but this determined dark elf was not taking the bait. In his free hand he held a dagger, poised below Catti-brie\u0027s elbow, just inches from her ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be gone!\" he said. \"Bregan D\u0027aerthe tells you to be gone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie didn\u0027t understand a word of it, but her enemy\u0027s con\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;fusion was at least equal to hers as six hundred pounds of black fur flew past, taking the surprised male on a splashing ride many feet from the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie turned fiercely on the orc, who pretended not to see a thing and began paddling frantically. The young woman looked back to the shore a moment later, fearful that Guenhwyvar would be left behind and would have to swim the entire distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge splash beside the boat (nearly overturning it) told her differently, and the panther was now the one leading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was simply too much for the terrified orc to take. The pitiful creature shrieked and leaped for the water, swimming desperately for the shore. Catti-brie took up the paddle and never looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ledge was open to both sides at first, and Drizzt heard the hiss of crossbow quarrels cutting the air over his head and just behind him. Fortunately for Drizzt, the firing drow were back across the ravine, at the base of the tall hillock, and hand crossbows were not very accurate at long range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt wasn\u0027t surprised when his running form began to glow in purplish hues, tiny faerie fires igniting along his arms and legs,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not burning, but marking him clearly to his enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a sting in his left shoulder and quickly reached over and popped out the small quarrel. The wound was only superficial, the dart\u0027s momentum mostly stalled by the dwarf crafted mithril chain mail that Drizzt wore. He ran on, and could only hope that not enough poison had entered his blood to tire him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ledge veered to the right, putting Drizzt\u0027s back to his ene\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;mies. He felt even more vulnerable then, for just a moment, but soon realized that the turn might be a good thing, putting more distance between him and the stinging crossbows. Soon after, as the quarrels bounced harmlessly behind him, the ledge veered again, back to the left, going around the base of another hillock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis put the lapping waters of Donigarten at Drizzt\u0027s right, a dozen feet below him. He thought of sheathing his blades and jumping in right there, but too many jagged mounds protruded from the water for him to chance it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ledge remained mostly open on his right as he sped along,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the drop sporadically blocked by only a few anchoring stalagmites. The hillock loomed on Drizzt\u0027s left, fully protecting him from the distant archers . . . but not from nearer enemies, he realized. As he came around a slight bend, he discovered at the last instant that beyond the bend lay a hollow, and in the hollow waited an enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier leaped out into Drizzt\u0027s path, sword and dirk waving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scimitar turned the sword aside, and Drizzt thrust straight ahead, knowing his second weapon would be intercepted by the dirk. When the weapons predictably locked, Drizzt used his momentum to push the dirk out wide and lifted one knee to collide heavily with the drow\u0027s belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt clapped his wide spread hands together, simultaneously snapping his scimitar hilts against his enemy\u0027s face. He snapped his weapons back out immediately, fearing that either the sword or dagger would dive at him, but his opponent was past retaliation. The evil drow fell straight to the ground, unconscious, and Drizzt plowed over him and kept on going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger had hit his stride, literally. Savage instincts churned within Drizzt, and he believed that no single drow could stand against him. He was fast reverting to the hunter again, the embodi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ment of primal, passionate rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark elf leaped out from behind the next stalagmite; Drizzt skidded down to one knee and spun, a similar maneuver to the one he had used against the drow at the mushroom house\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, though, his enemy had more time to react, had his sword down to the stone to block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunter knew that he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s lead foot caught hold, and he spun up from his slide,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;his trailing foot flying wide in a circle kick that caught the surprised drow under the chin and dropped him over the side of the ledge. He caught a handhold just a few feet down, groggy from the blow and thinking that this purple eyed fiend would surely kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunter was already gone, though, running on, running for freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt saw another drow on the path in front of him, this one\u0027s arm held up before him, probably aiming a hand crossbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunter was quicker than the quarrel. His instincts told him that, repeatedly, and they were proven correct when a flashing scim\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;itar intercepted the dart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Drizzt was upon the drow, and the drow\u0027s ally, who came out from behind the nearest mound. The two enemies worked furi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ously with their weapons, thinking their numerical advantage more than sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t understand the hunter, but the red glowing eyes of Artemis Entreri, watching from a nearby hollow, did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 4 IN THE WEB ne of the sects of Faerun names the sins of humanity as seven,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and foremost among them is pride. My interpretation of this had always been to think of the arrogance of kings, who pro\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;claimed themselves gods, or at least convinced their subjects that they spoke with some divine beings, thus conveying the image that their power was god given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is only one manifestation of this most deadly of sins. One does not have to be a king to be taken down by false pride. Montolio DeBrouchee,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;my ranger mentor, warned me about this, but his lessons concerned a per\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;sonal aspect of pride. \"A ranger often walks alone, but never walks without friends nearby, \" the wise man explained. \"A ranger knows his surround\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ings and knows where allies might be found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Mon tolio\u0027s way of thinking, pride was blindness, a blurring of insight and wisdom, and the defeat of trust. A too proud man walked alone and cared not where allies might be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I discovered the web of Menzoberranzan growing thick about me, I understood my error, my arrogance. Had I come to think so much of myself and my abilities that I forgot those allies who had, to this point,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;allowed me to survive? In my anger over the death of Wulfgar and my fears for Catti-brie, Bruenor, and Regis, I never considered that those living friends could help to take care of themselves. The problem that had befallen us all was my own fault, I had decided, and, thus, was my duty to correct,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;however impossible that might be for a single person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would go to Menzoberranzan, discover the truth, and end the con\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;flict, even if that end meant the sacrifice of my own life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a fool I had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePride told me that I was the cause of Wulfgar\u0027s death; pride told me that I could be the one to right the wrong. Sheer arrogance prevented me from dealing openly with my friend, the dwarven king, who could muster the forces necessary to combat any forthcoming drow attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that ledge on the Isle of Rothe, I realized that I would pay for my arrogance; later, I would learn that others dear to me might pay as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a deftat of the spirit to learn that one\u0027s arrogance causes such loss and pain. Pride invites you to soar to heights of personal triumph, but the wind is stronger at those heights and the footing, tentative. Farther, then, is the fall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-18.html","bookId":2128,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM"}
