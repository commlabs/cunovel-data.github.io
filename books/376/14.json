THE LONDON CLERK.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Jonathan Tarbox seemed to have taken a fancy to our hero, for immediately after lunch he followed him on deck. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want to show you a drawin\u0027 of my plow, Mr. Hunter,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like to see it, Mr. Tarbox, but I am no judge of such things.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Tarbox drew a paper from his coat-pocket containing a sketch of his invention. He entered into a voluble explanation of it, to which Frank listened good-naturedly, though without much comprehension.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think it\u0027ll work?\" asked the inventor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think it might. Mr. Tarbox, but then I don\u0027t know much about such things.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t believe they\u0027ve got anything in Europe that\u0027ll come up to it,\" said Mr. Tarbox, complacently. \"Ef I can get it introduced into [124] England and France, it\u0027ll pay me handsome.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you shown it to any Englishman yet?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I haven\u0027t. I don\u0027t know any.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There are some on board this steamer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are there? Where?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank pointed out a young man with weak eyes and auburn hair, a London clerk, who visited the United States on a business errand, and was now returning. He was at this moment standing on deck, with his arms folded, looking out to sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess I\u0027ll go and speak to him,\" said Mr. Tarbox. \"May be he can help me introduce my plow in London.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank watched with some amusement the interview between Mr. Tarbox and the London clerk, which he shrewdly suspected was not likely to lead to any satisfactory results.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Tarbox approached the Englishman from behind, and unceremoniously slapped him on the back.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [125]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The clerk whirled round suddenly and surveyed Mr. Tarbox with mingled surprise and indignation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you say?\" he inquired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How are you, old hoss?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you mean to call me a \u0027oss?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I call you a hoss. How do you feel?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t feel any better for your hitting me on the back, sir,\" said the clerk, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sho! your back must be weak. Been sea-sick?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have suffered some from sea-sickness,\" returned the person addressed, with an air of restraint.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So have I. I tell you I thought something was goin\u0027 to cave in.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of what earthly interest does he suppose that is to me?\" thought the clerk, superciliously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Fact is,\" continued Mr. Tarbox, \"I\u0027d a good deal rather be to home in Squashboro\u0027, livin\u0027 on baked beans, than be here livin\u0027 on all their chicken fixin\u0027s. I suppose you\u0027ve heard of Squashboro\u0027 hain\u0027t you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [126]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t say I have,\" said the clerk, coldly, adjusting his eye-glasses, and turning away from his uncongenial companion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Squashboro\u0027, State o\u0027 Maine. It\u0027s a pooty smart place—got three stores, a blacksmith\u0027s shop, a grist mill, and two meetin\u0027-houses.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really, my friend,\" said the Englishman, \"Squashboro\u0027 may be as smart a place as you say, but it doesn\u0027t interest me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t it? That\u0027s because you haven\u0027t been there. We\u0027ve got some smart men in Squashboro\u0027.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t say so?\" said the other, in a sarcastic tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s Squire Perkins, selectman, town clerk and auctioneer. You\u0027d ought to hear his tongue go when he auctioneers. Then there\u0027s Parson Pratt—knows a sight of Latin, Greek and Hebrew.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you one of the smart men of Squashboro\u0027?\" asked the clerk, in the same tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wal, that ain\u0027t for me to say,\" answered Mr. Tarbox, modestly. \"You never can tell what may happen, as the hen said when she hatched a lot [127] of geese. But I\u0027ll tell you what, Mr. Englishman—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My name is Robinson,\" interrupted the other, stiffly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, howdy do, Mr. Robinson!\" exclaimed Jonathan, seizing the unwilling hand of the other and shaking it vigorously. \"My name is Tarbox—Jonathan Tarbox, named after my grandfather. His name was Jonathan, too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really, your family history is very interesting.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Glad you think so. But as I was sayin\u0027, when you spoke about me bein\u0027 smart, I\u0027ve got up a new plow that\u0027s goin\u0027 to take the shine off all that\u0027s goin\u0027,\" and he plunged his hand into his pocket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t carry a plow round in your pocket, do you?\" asked Mr. Robinson, arching his eyebrows.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come, now, Mr. Robinson, that\u0027s a good joke for you. I\u0027ve got a plan of it here on this piece of paper. If you\u0027ll squat down somewhere, I\u0027ll explain it to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I prefer standing, Mr.—Mr. Tarbarrel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [128]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tarbox is my name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah—Tarbox, then. No great difference.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see, Mr. Robberson—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Robinson, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah—is it?\" said Jonathan, innocently. \"No great difference.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Robinson looked suspicious, but the expression of his companion\u0027s face was unchanged, and betrayed no malice prepense.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about plows,\" said the clerk, coldly. \"You\u0027d better show it to somebody else—I never saw a plow in my life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never saw a plow!\" ejaculated Jonathan, in the utmost surprise. \"Why, where have you been livin\u0027 all your life?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In London.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And don\u0027t they have plows in the stores?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose they may, but they\u0027re not in my line.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, I knowed a plow as soon as I could walk,\" said Mr. Tarbox.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I leave such things to laborers,\" said Mr. Robinson, superciliously. [129] \"I feel no interest in them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ain\u0027t you a laborer yourself?\" asked Jonathan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I—a laborer!\" exclaimed Mr. Robinson, with natural indignation. \"Do you mean to insult me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I never insult nobody. But don\u0027t you work for a livin\u0027? That\u0027s what I mean.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am engaged in trade,\" answered the clerk, haughtily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you do work for a livin\u0027, and so, of course, you\u0027re a laborer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir, men in my business are not laborers—they are merchants.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I perceive, sir, that you are not accustomed to society. I excuse you on account of your ignorance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ignorance! What do you mean by that?\" demanded Mr. Tarbox, in his turn indignant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jonathan looked threatening, and as he was physically the Englishman\u0027s superior, the latter answered hastily:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [130]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I only meant to say that you were not versed in the requirements and conventionalities of society.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is that English?\" asked Jonathan, with a puzzled look.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I never heard sich jawbreakers before, but, if it\u0027s an apology, it\u0027s all right. Won\u0027t you look at the plow, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would be of no use, Mr. Tarbox—I don\u0027t know about such things, I assure you. You had better show it to somebody else. My life has been passed in London, and I really am profoundly ignorant of agricultural implements.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he spoke, he turned away and walked down stairs. Mr. Tarbox followed him with his eyes, ejaculating:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s a queer critter. He\u0027s over thirty years old, I guess, and he\u0027s never sot eyes on a plow! He\u0027d ought to be ashamed of his ignorance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Mr. Tarbox,\" said Frank, when his new friend rejoined him, \"did you explain your new invention to the Englishman?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was goin\u0027 to, but he said he never seed one in the whole course of his life, and didn\u0027t take no interest in them. What do you think of that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He can\u0027t have been in the country much, I should think.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He keeps store in London, he says; but he\u0027s a poor, ignorant creetur, and he don\u0027t want to learn. I wanted to explain all about my invention, but he wouldn\u0027t look at it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There are other Englishmen who will take more interest in it, Mr. Tarbox—men who live in the country and cultivate the land.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope so. I hope they ain\u0027t all as ignorant as that creetur. Do you think that colonel that you\u0027re travelin\u0027 with would like to look at it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t believe he would, Mr. Tarbox. I don\u0027t know much about him, but he seems to me like a man that has always lived in the city.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just as you say. I\u0027d just as lief explain it to him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you going to put it in the exhibition?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; I\u0027ve got it packed in my trunk in pieces. I\u0027m going to put it together on the other side, and take it along with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was not the last conversation Frank had with Mr. Tarbox. He always listened with sympathy to the recital of the other\u0027s plans and purposes, and Jonathan showed a marked predilection for the society of our young hero. Without knowing it, Frank was making a friend who would be of value in the future.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81716.html","bookId":376,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM"}
