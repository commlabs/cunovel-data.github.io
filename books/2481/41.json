There was a surprising lack of women in the fort and it had taken her awhile to realize this. Most of the women were older and married. It saddened her, but made her feel that she needed to prove herself and pull her own weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan stood near the back door instructing everyone where to go. One by one, the men spread out to take up positions. Katie found herself to be the last one Juan paid attention to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Travis wants us to meet him up on the balcony,\" Juan said. He looked very tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Hey, Loca, we\u0027re wanted upstairs,\" Juan said to Jenni with an evil glint in his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bite me, redneck,\" Jenni answered and made a face at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan made chomping noises at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so out of this,\" Katie said, and hurried back into the building and up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Redneck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Redneck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Redneck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mucha loca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Redneck,\" Jenni said again as they followed Katie up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you calling me a hick spic?\" Juan asked in his thick West Texas twang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I\u0027m calling you just a plain ol\u0027 hick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I am so out of this one,\" Katie said firmly, and walked down the hallway toward the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan laughed and Jenni smacked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie could tell they were tussling by all the noise behind her, but she decided not to pay attention. It has been clear since she had returned that Jenni and Juan were locked in a highly adversarial battle of the wills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping carefully onto the rickety balcony, she found Travis looking over the zombies. Because all the guards were visible to the crowd, the zombies were fairly evenly dispersed along the perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see a weak spot,\" Travis said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie looked over the perimeter slowly, studying it. \"Me neither.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you, they\u0027ve gotten smart,\" Juan said, his tone suddenly quite serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni timidly stepped out and surveyed the crowd below. \"They\u0027re just doing what they always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but somehow, five managed to get over the trucks.\" Travis shook his head. \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie\u0027s gaze swept over the crowd slowly. Something was amiss. She swept her gaze over them again, then saw what it was. All the zombies were going crazy trying to get to the guards, but one zombie, toward the back, was just studying the trucks and the barriers that kept it from its meal of warm flesh. It\u0027s just kept swinging its head back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some are thinking, \"Katie said softly. She pointed and they all looked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, she\u0027s right,\" Travis grunted with disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie moved slowly to one side to let a small crowd of children through to bang on one of the trucks. It was one of the more stripped down zombies; not much was left on its bones. It\u0027s skull-like head once more turned to look at the perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate slipped the safety off her rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie moved resolutely toward one particular truck. It was a large truck full of dirt with cement bags packed tightly under it and between the cab of the truck and the load. It pushed its way toward the crowd, reached up and started trying to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gawddammit!\" Juan\u0027s voice was almost feral. \"Fucking shit! These things are breaking all the gawddamn rules!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slung her rifle off her shoulder and raised it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie?\" Travis said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t afford for a smart one to survive,\" Katie answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer finger began to close on the trigger, then she hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Travis…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie, its broken body barely able to stand, gave up the door. It staggered to one side and began to claw at the sandbags, as if to get purchase to lift itself up. Around its neck hung a crocheted purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that\u0027s Laura,\" Katie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Laura?\" Jenni asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie took aim again, sighting the remains of the girl carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie that had been Laura managed to get a good grip and started to pull itself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie shot it through the head and it fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies ignored the shot and continued to bang on the trucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re getting smarter,\" Katie said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis looked ill and nodded. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have the ammo. It\u0027s time to kill them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni blinked. \"Yeah! They\u0027re all corralled! Easy pickings!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t-\" Travis started, but stopped himself. \"Okay. In the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shouldn\u0027t waste all that ammo,\" Juan muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not wasting it if we are securing our perimeter and our safety,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be like shooting fish in a barrel,\" Travis sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni had one of the biggest grins on her face Katie had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027ll be fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so loca,\" Juan declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, hick spic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am so not a part of this,\" Katie declared and slipped past them into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt Travis following her, and when they were far enough from the arguing two, she turned toward him. His face was a mask of pain and uncertainty. \"We have to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis nodded. He said softly, \"Once we start firing those guns, we may bring more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to risk more of those things figuring out how to get past the trucks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis sighed. \"Yeah, I know. In theory, the spikes could slow a lot of them down. The Hurricane fence would probably stand for a little while, but then they\u0027d be up against the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded her face tense. \"We cannot afford to lose ground to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt it to her bones that if the zombies ever breached the first perimeter, things would not go well for them, despite the security of the wall. They needed to gain ground, not lose it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis looked back at Jenni and Juan who were now cursing each other out in Spanish. He blinked. Jenni knew Spanish?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie glanced back down the hall then grinned. \"Kinda like kindergarten flirting, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, you\u0027re not jealous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie snorted. \"Yeah, right. Like I\u0027d be jealous of Juan.\" She gave him a bemused look. But her stomach was coiled into knots. She was horribly afraid. There seemed to never be time for peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis gave her a decidedly goofy look. \"Yeah, well, anyway, let\u0027s start planning what we\u0027re doing. I guess I\u0027ll wake the Mayor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and touched his arm. \"Travis, it’s a war. We have to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and said. \"The thing about war is that there are always causalities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie felt a chill flow down her spine and she glanced toward Jenni. She felt her stomach tighten and she looked back at Travis. \"But we have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know,\" he answered sadly They stood in silence for a long moment and Katie looked toward the still arguing Juan and Jenni. \"We better get the Mayor…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. The Killing Grounds\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni flipped Juan off discreetly behind Katie\u0027s back, then found a place to sit down in the Mayor\u0027s office. The Mayor looked weary and overwhelmed with the news of the zombies climbing over the trucks. Tobias\u0027 death had weighed heavily on him and he looked haggard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis looked a little better than he had. It was as if he was finding his role to play in this world and growing comfortable with it. Jenni thought he was cute in a little boy sort of way. Jason and Curtis often hung out, talking, and just being guys. It made Jenni happy. Jason needed a friend, considering all he had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni, meanwhile, was glowing with happiness over what she had gained. Katie was back and she was just ecstatic over that fact. And of course, Travis was back, too. And that made her girlishly giggly with delight. She couldn\u0027t help it. He was such an incredible guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe phased in and out of the conversation that followed. It really didn\u0027t interest her except when they talked about killing the zombies. She was surprised there were opposing voices to the plan. Juan was worried about running out of ammunition if they used so much right off the bat. The Mayor was worried about riling up the zombies even more. Jenni rolled her eyes during some of the discussion and Katie leaned over and took her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni knew it was the \"behave\" signal, so she tried not to give snarky looks. It wasn\u0027t all that easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe debate went back and forth. Katie was adamant about wiping out the zombie horde before it got any bigger and they got any smarter. Jenni thought she was making the most sense. Travis was conflicted about the whole gun issue and argued that maybe they should try to find an alternate way to wipe out the zombies. Jenni considered smacking him upside the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan sat near her and kept muttering in Spanish. Jenni muttered right back at him. Soon they were discreetly swearing at each other. The crux of the argument was that Jenni was a bloodthirsty psycho and that Juan was too stupid to understand guns were made to be fired. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-41.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
