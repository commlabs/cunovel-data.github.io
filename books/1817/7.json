Jacob is a sick kid and they flew here to see a specialist. Diana just lost her job and spent the last of her savings on this trip for him. I feel bad for the kid, so I think a trip to the museum would be good for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My...my, look at Collin Black acting like a responsible adult.” She winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay...okay. Can we get back to going over these plans?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WOW!” Mom, look!” Jacob pointed as he ran to Sue, the largest and most famous T. Rex on display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let them run ahead as I stayed back and smiled at how excited he was to be here. I knew he would be. My mom and dad used to bring me and Julia here all the time when we were kids. I brought Hailey here once, but she didn’t like it; she said it wasn’t her thing and I was kind of hurt by it because this museum was one of my favorites. I walked over to where Jacob and Diana were standing, and Jacob looked at me with a huge smile on his face. I pulled out my phone and took a picture of Sue, the T. Rex, and sent it to Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sue is going to eat you up, Julia!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lol, what are you doing at the museum?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to say that to her every time we’d come here and she’d get scared and hold onto my dad for dear life. My mom used to tell me not to tease her, but I couldn’t help it. It was the one thing she wasn’t so sure of at the museum, so I used it to my advantage. I asked Jacob and Diana to stand in front of the T. Rex so I could get a picture of them. After I took it, I sent it to Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought Jacob and Diana here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad told me about them. That was really nice of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll talk about it when I get back to New York.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we entered the Dinosaur Hall and Jacob ran ahead to see the wooly mammoth, I asked Diana about the appointment with the specialist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did the appointment go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same as always. There’s nothing really new they can do for him. The doctor gave me a script for a new antibiotic for when Jacob gets another lung infection and he’s going to discuss other optional treatments with his regular doctor in New York.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Diana. I wish there was something I could do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sweet, Collin, thank you. But, Jacob and I will be fine. I’ve been a single parent now for about five years, ever since his dad died in a car accident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I didn’t know if I could hear any more. Diana reminded me of my mom. She was strong and she seemed like a fighter. Jacob looked back at us and took both our hands as he led us over to another dinosaur display. After we left Dinosaur Hall, we stopped and grabbed some sandwiches at the Field Bistro. I could tell Jacob was getting tired and he started to cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe after a couple more displays, we should get going,” Diana said to Jacob as she ran her hand through his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, no, and stop with the hair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe your mom’s right, bro. You’re looking kind of tired,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began coughing. “Okay, maybe I am ready to leave now.” He coughed some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana took hold of his hand and we walked out of the museum. My car was waiting for us at the curb. When we got back to the hotel, Diana thanked me and said that she was going to take Jacob up to the room and let him rest while she took a shower. I told her to order room service for the night and meet me at the restaurant in the hotel for breakfast in the morning. Jacob and I high-fived and Diana smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I took the elevator up, I pulled my phone from my pocket and decided to send a text message to Ellie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, sexy. I need you tonight. How about we get drunk and have wild sex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good, hot stuff. Let’s meet at Stingray’s around eight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make sure you wear something sexy for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always do,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I stepped into the room, I took off my clothes and got in the shower. I had a few hours before I had to meet Ellie, so after I showered, I took a nap. I dreamt of Hailey. We were at the beach in the Hamptons, playing volleyball and eating burgers. When I awoke, I was sweating. Fuck, I thought to myself as I sat on the edge of the bed with my face in my hands. I got up and got dressed. This was nothing that a lot of alcohol and a hot sexy woman couldn’t fix. As I was fixing my hair in the mirror, Ellie sent me a naked picture of herself. I smiled as I looked at her perfectly round tits. I couldn’t wait to get those babies in my mouth. I was getting hard and I felt the need to jack off to her picture. But then I decided that I could wait until later when I could have her all to myself. I sent her a text message back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t wait to fuck you deep and hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looking forward to it. I have some toys for us to play with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. When I read that, my cock, which had just started to go limp, shot straight up again. As I smiled and set my phone down, there was a knock on the door. I walked over and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, son. Going somewhere?” he asked as he made his way into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Umm, actually, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great, I’ll join you,” he said as he set his bag on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seeing what you’re up to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You flew all the way to Chicago to see what I was up to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep,” he replied as he nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed as he sat down in the chair. “Listen, your mom was worried about you. So, to please her, I told her I’d fly out here and check up on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she was so worried, then why didn’t she come herself?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because she had plans with Peyton that she couldn’t cancel. Think of it this way; we’ll have some father-son bonding time.” He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my phone and sent Ellie a text message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, babe. I have to cancel our plans. My dad just showed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring your sexy daddy with you. It’ll be fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very funny. We’ll hook up the next time I’m back in Chicago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, hot stuff, but I’ll miss you tonight. I was really looking forward to trying out those toys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next time, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and set my phone down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess. You just canceled your plans with either Sarah, Tru, Bella, Ellie, or Riley.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-7.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
