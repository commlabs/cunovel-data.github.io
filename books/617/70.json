{"id":42950,"no":70,"title":"The Poet And The Peasant","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe other day a poet friend of mine, who has lived in close communion with nature all his life, wrote a poem and took it to an editor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a living pastoral, full of the genuine breath of the fields, the song of birds, and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the poet called again to see about it, with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his heart, it was handed back to him with the comment:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Too artificial.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of us met over spaghetti and Dutchess County chianti, and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd there we dug a pit for the editor. With us was Conant, a well-arrived writer of fiction - a man who had trod on asphalt all his life, and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eConant wrote a poem and called it \"The Doe and the Brook.\" It was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with Amaryllis only as far as the florist\u0027s windows, and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter. Conant signed this poem, and we sent it to the same editor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut this has very little to do with the story.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJust as the editor was reading the first line of the poem, on the next morning, a being stumbled off the West Shore ferryboat, and loped slowly up Forty-second Street.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe invader was a young man with light blue eyes, a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphan\u0027s (afterward discovered to be the earl\u0027s daughter) in one of Mr. Blaney\u0027s plays. His trousers were corduroy, his coat short-sleeved, with buttons in the middle of his back. One bootleg was outside the corduroys. You looked expectantly, though in vain, at his straw hat for ear holes, its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor. In his hand was a valise - description of it is an impossible task; a Boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it. And above one ear, in his hair, was a wisp of hay - the rustic\u0027s letter of credit, his badge of innocence, the last clinging touch of the Garden of Eden lingering to shame the gold-brick men.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKnowingly, smilingly, the city crowds passed him by. They saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings. At this they ceased to smile, and even to look at him. It had been done so often. A few glanced at the antique valise to see what Coney \"attraction\" or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory. But for the most part he was ignored. Even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt Eighth Avenue stood \"Bunco Harry,\" with his dyed mustache and shiny, good-natured eyes. Harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part. He edged up to the countryman, who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window, and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Too thick, pal,\" he said, critically - \"too thick by a couple of inches. I don\u0027t know what your lay is; but you\u0027ve got the properties too thick. That hay, now - why, they don\u0027t even allow that on Proctor\u0027s circuit any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand you, mister,\" said the green one. \"I\u0027m not lookin\u0027 for any circus. I\u0027ve just run down from Ulster County to look at the town, bein\u0027 that the hayin\u0027s over with. Gosh! but it\u0027s a whopper. I thought Poughkeepsie was some punkins; but this here town is five times as big.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well,\" said \"Bunco Harry,\" raising his eyebrows, \"I didn\u0027t mean to butt in. You don\u0027t have to tell. I thought you ought to tone down a little, so I tried to put you wise. Wish you success at your graft, whatever it is. Come and have a drink, anyhow.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t mind having a glass of lager beer,\" acknowledged the other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey went to a cafe frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes, and sat at their drinks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad I come across you, mister,\" said Haylocks. \"How\u0027d you like to play a game or two of seven-up? I\u0027ve got the keerds.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe fished them out of Noah\u0027s valise - a rare, inimitable deck, greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Bunco Harry\" laughed loud and briefly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for me, sport,\" he said, firmly. \"I don\u0027t go against that make-up of yours for a cent. But I still say you\u0027ve overdone it. The Reubs haven\u0027t dressed like that since \u002779. I doubt if you could work Brooklyn for a key-winding watch with that layout.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you needn\u0027t think I ain\u0027t got the money,\" boasted Haylocks. He drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup, and laid it on the table.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Got that for my share of grandmother\u0027s farm,\" he announced. \"There\u0027s $950 in that roll. Thought I\u0027d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Bunco Harry\" took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen worse,\" he said, critically. \"But you\u0027ll never do it in them clothes. You want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band, and talk a good deal about Pittsburg and freight differentials, and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his line?\" asked two or three shifty-eyed men of \"Bunco Harry\" after Haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The queer, I guess,\" said Harry. \"Or else he\u0027s one of Jerome\u0027s men. Or some guy with a new graft. He\u0027s too much hayseed. Maybe that his - I wonder now - oh, no, it couldn\u0027t have been real money.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaylocks wandered on. Thirst probably assailed him again, for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer. At first sight of him their eyes brightened; but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaylocks swung his valise across the bar.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep that a while for me, mister,\" he said, chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar. \"I\u0027ll be back after I knock around a spell. And keep your eye on it, for there\u0027s $950 inside of it, though maybe you wouldn\u0027t think so to look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece, and Haylocks was off for it, his coat-tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Divvy, Mike,\" said the men hanging upon the bar, winking openly at one another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Honest, now,\" said the bartender, kicking the valise to one side. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027d fall to that, do you? Anybody can see he ain\u0027t no jay. One of McAdoo\u0027s come-on squad, I guess. He\u0027s a shine if he made himself up. There ain\u0027t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to Providence, Rhode Island. If he\u0027s got nine-fifty in that valise it\u0027s a ninety-eight cent Waterbury that\u0027s stopped at ten minutes to ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Haylocks had exhausted the resources of Mr. Edison to amuse he returned for his valise. And then down Broadway he gallivanted, culling the sights with his eager blue eyes. But still and evermore Broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles. He was the oldest of the \"gags\" that the city must endure. He was so flagrantly impossible, so ultra rustic, so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard, the hayfield and the vaudeville stage, that he excited only weariness and suspicion. And the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine, so fresh and redolent of the meadows, so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow-backs from the valise. The outer one, a twenty, he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Son,\" said he, \"run somewhere and get this changed for me. I\u0027m mighty nigh out of chicken feed. I guess you\u0027ll get a nickel if you\u0027ll hurry up.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, watchert\u0027ink! G\u0027wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself. Dey ain\u0027t no farm clothes yer got on. G\u0027wan wit yer stage money.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn a corner lounged a keen-eyed steerer for a gambling-house. He was Haylocks, and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister,\" said the rural one. \"I\u0027ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno. I got $950 in this valise, and I come down from old Ulster to see the sights. Know where a fellow could get action on about $9 or $10? I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have some sport, and then maybe I\u0027ll buy out a business of some kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe steerer looked pained, and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheese it, old man,\" he murmured, reproachfully. \"The Central Office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie. You couldn\u0027t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them Tony Pastor props. The recent Mr. Scotty from Death Valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of Elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories. Let it be skiddoo for yours. Nay, I know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities, Haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my clothes,\" said he; \"durned if it ain\u0027t. They think I\u0027m a hayseed and won\u0027t have nothin\u0027 to do with me. Nobody never made fun of this hat in Ulster County. I guess if you want folks to notice you in New York you must dress up like they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo Haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows. And messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on Broadway within the lights of Long Acre.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt 9 o\u0027clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom Ulster County would have foresworn. Bright tan were his shoes; his hat the latest block. His light gray trousers were deeply creased; a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant English walking coat. His collar might have graced a laundry window; his blond hair was trimmed close; the wisp of hay was gone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant he stood, resplendent, with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures. And then he turned down the gay, bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision. A stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The juiciest jay I\u0027ve seen in six months,\" said the man with gray eyes. \"Come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was half-past eleven when a man galloped into the West Forty-seventh Street Police Station with the story of his wrongs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine hundred and fifty dollars,\" he gasped, \"all my share of grandmother\u0027s farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe desk seargeant wrung from him the name Jabez Bulltongue, of Locust Valley farm, Ulster County, and then bagan to take descriptions of the strong-arm gentlemen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem, he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by Rodin and J. G. Brown.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"When I read the first line of \u0027The Doe and the Brook,\u0027\" said the editor, \"I knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with Nature. The finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact. To use a somewhat homely comparison, it was as if a wild, free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down Broadway. Beneath the apparel the man would show.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" said Conant. \"I suppose the check will be round on Thursday, as usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed. You can take your choice of \"Stay on the Farm\" or \"Don\u0027t Write Poetry.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/42/1304.html","bookId":617,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:24:47 AM"}
