{"id":91939,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Mercenaries\", Sandip said with a grunt. \"We’ve passed several batches of them. Not a one seemed inclined to lift a finger\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see about that\", Talmanes said. People still flooded out through the city gates, coughing, clutching meager possessions, leading crying children. That flow would not soon slacken. Caemlyn was as full as an inn on market day; the ones lucky enough to be escaping would be only a small fraction compared to those still inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talmanes\", Sandip said quietly, \"that city’s going to become a death trap soon. There aren’t enough ways out. If we let the Band become pinned inside . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the gates a wave of feeling surged through the refugees. It was almost a physical thing, a shudder. The screams grew more intense. Talmanes spun; hulking figures moved in the shadows inside the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light!\" Sandip said. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trollocs\", Talmanes said, turning Selfar. \"Light! They’re going to try to seize the gate, stop the refugees\". There were five gates out of the city; if the Trollocs held all of them . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was already a slaughter. If the Trollocs could stop the frightened people from fleeing, it would grow far worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry the ranks!\" Talmanes yelled. \"All men to the city gates!\" He spurred Selfar into a gallop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building would have been called an inn elsewhere, though Isam had never seen anyone inside except for the dull-eyed women who tended the few drab rooms and prepared tasteless meals. Visits here were never for comfort. He sat on a hard stool at a pine table so worn with age, it had likely grayed long before Isam’s birth. He refrained from touching the surface overly much, lest he come away with more splinters than an Aiel had spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsam’s dented tin cup was filled with a dark liquid, though he wasn’t drinking. He sat beside the wall, near enough the inn’s single window to watch the dirt street outside, dimly lit in the evening by a few rusty lanterns hung outside buildings. Isam took care not to let his profile show through the smeared glass. He never looked directly out. It was always best not to attract attention in the Town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the only name the place had, if it could be said to have a name at all. The sprawling ramshackle buildings had been put up and replaced countless times over two thousand years. It actually resembled a good-sized town, if you squinted. Most of the buildings had been constructed by prisoners, often with little or no knowledge of the craft. They’d been supervised by men equally ignorant. A fair number of the houses seemed held up by those to either side of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat dribbled down the side of Isam’s face, as he covertly watched that street. Which one would come for him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, he could barely make out the profile of a mountain splitting the night sky. Metal rasped against metal somewhere out in the Town like steel heartbeats. Figures moved on the street. Men, heavily cloaked and hooded, with faces hidden up to the eyes behind blood-red veils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsam was careful not to let his eyes linger on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder rumbled. The slopes of that mountain were filled with odd lightning bolts that struck upward toward the ever-present gray clouds. Few humans knew of this Town not so far from the valley of Thakan\u0027dar, with Shayol Ghul itself looming above. Few knew rumors of its existence. Isam would not have minded being among the ignorant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of the men passed. Red veils. They kept them up always. Well, almost always. If you saw one lower his veil, it was time to kill him. Because if you didn’t, he’d kill you. Most of the red-veiled men seemed to have no reason to be out, beyond scowling at each other and perhaps kicking at the numerous stray dogs--slat-ribbed and feral—whenever one crossed their path. The few women who had left shelter scuttled along the edges of the street, eyes lowered. There were no children to be seen, and likely few to be found. The Town was no place for children. Isam knew. He had grown from infancy here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men passing on the street looked up at Isam’s window and stopped. Isam went very still. The Samma N’Sei, the Eye Blinders, had always been touchy and full of pride. No, touchy was too mild a term. They required no more than whim to take a knife to one of the Talentless. Usually it was one of the servants who paid. Usually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-veiled man continued to regard him. Isam stilled his nerves and did not make a show of staring back. His summons here had been urgent, and one did not ignore such things if one wished to live. But still . . . if the man took one step toward the building, Isam would slip into Tel’ararirhiod, secure in the knowledge that not even one of the Chosen could follow him from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly the Samma N’Sei turned from the window. In a flash he was moving away from the building, striding quickly. Isam felt some of his tension melt away, though it would never truly leave him, not in this place. This place was not home, despite his childhood here. This place was death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMotion. Isam glanced toward the end of the street. Another tall man, in a black coat and cloak, was walking toward him, his face exposed. Incredibly, the street was emptying as Samma N’Sei darted off down other streets and alleys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was Moridin. Isam had not been there to witness the Chosen’s first visit to the Town, but he had heard. The Samma N’Sei had thought Moridin one of the Talentless until he demonstrated differently. The constraints that held them did not hold him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe numbers of dead Samma N’Sei varied with the telling, but the claim never dipped below a dozen. By the evidence of his eyes, Isam could believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Moridin reached the inn, the street was empty save for the dogs. And Moridin walked right on past. Isam watched as closely as he dared. Moridin seemed uninterested in him or the inn, which was where Isam had been instructed to wait. Perhaps the Chosen had other business, and Isam would be an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Moridin passed, Isam finally took a sip of his dark drink. The locals just called it \"fire\". It lived up to its name. It was supposedly related to some drink from the Waste. Like everything else in the Town, it was a corrupt version of the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long was Moridin going to make him wait? Isam didn’t like being here. It reminded him too much of his childhood. A servant passed—a woman with a dress so frayed that it was practically rags—and dropped a plate onto the table. The two didn’t exchange a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsam looked at his meal. Vegetables—peppers and onions, mostly—sliced thin and boiled. He picked at one and took a taste, then sighed and pushed the meal aside. The vegetables were as bland as unseasoned millet porridge. There wasn’t any meat. That was actually good; he didn’t like to eat meat unless he’d seen it killed and slaughtered himself. That was a remnant of his childhood. If you hadn’t seen it slaughtered yourself, you couldn’t know. Not for certain. Up here, if you found meat, it could have been something that had been caught in the south, or maybe an animal that had been raised \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-4.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
