He swam with his good arm and begged more from his legs, but every movement sent stabbing pain across his shoulder. Through the crashing surf, he caught another glimpse of the jetty. Bear and Wylan pulled the rope hand over hand, bringing in Old Will. Willow and Flea stood nearby, shaking and soaked. Reef and Gren perched on the rocks, yelling for him, ready to hoist him out of the water. Perry kicked harder, but his legs wouldn’t answer. Wouldn’t move the way he wanted them to. He was coughing up seawater and couldn’t catch his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one way out of this. He stopped swimming and plunged underwater. He grabbed his wrist and took an instant to shore up his resolve. Then he pulled it across his body. Spots of red burst before his eyes. It felt like he was ripping his own muscles, the pain an explosion inside his shoulder, but the joint wouldn’t spring back into place. He let go of his arm. Couldn’t try again. Was sure he’d pass out if he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed up, cutting through the churning water, his breath running out. He kicked harder, searching for the surface. Searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSearching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he couldn’t tell which way was up. Fear threatened to overtake him, but he forced himself to swim with calm strokes. Panic would mean the end. Long seconds later, his lungs screaming for oxygen, panic came anyway, and he felt himself thrashing wildly in the water, his body moving beyond his control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he couldn’t breathe. That he wouldn’t draw in air. No matter how he fought against it, he couldn’t stop himself. The ache in his lungs and his head was bigger than the pain in his shoulder. Bigger than anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth and inhaled. An explosion of cold shot down his throat. In the next instant, he pushed it back out. The bright red bursts came back, and his chest convulsed, pulling, pushing. Needing, rejecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped down into colder water, where it grew darker and quieter and darker still. He felt his limbs relax, then an aching sorrow spread through him, replacing the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria. He’d just gotten her back. Didn’t want to leave. Didn’t want to hurt her. Didn’t want—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething slammed into his throat. The Blood Lord chain … strangling him. He grasped for it, and then he realized someone was above, tugging him upward. The chain loosened, but now he felt an arm around his chest, and he was moving, being towed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke the surface and retched seawater, convulsing with his entire being. He felt a rope being tied around his ribs, and then Gren and Wylan were hauling him up to the rocks while someone pushed him from behind. It could only be Reef.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear grabbed for his arm, cursing as he almost slid into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoulder!” Perry gritted through his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear understood, wrapping his arm around Perry’s waist and carrying him beyond the reach of the crashing waves. Perry kept going after he was set down. He clambered across the jetty, desperate, until he reached sand. Then he sank and folded around the pain in his gut—in his shoulder—in his throat. His lungs felt like they’d been beaten blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA circle formed around him, but he kept coughing, struggling to find his breath. Finally he swiped the saltwater from his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShame hit him hard. He was on his back, broken in front of his people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGren shook his head, like he couldn’t believe what had just happened. Old Will stood with Willow tucked into his side. Reef’s chest heaved, the scar across his cheek bright red. Above, the Aether turned in massive, vengeful wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His arm’s out of its socket,” Bear said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pull it up and then across,” Reef said. “Slow and firm, and don’t stop, no matter what. And be quick about it. We need to get inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry shut his eyes. Huge hands closed over his wrist; then he heard Bear’s deep voice above him. “You won’t like this, Perry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBody shaking with nerves and cold, Perry climbed up to his loft, clutching his arm to his side. Awkwardly, hissing at the ache in his shoulder, he pulled his sopping shirt over his head and flung it across the room below. It landed with a splat on the fireplace mantel, hanging there. He lay back and drew breath after breath into his battered lungs as he watched the Aether through the open sliver in the roof. Rain dripped through it, tapping on his chest. Rolling to the mattress beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a few minutes. He needed some time alone before he had to face the tribe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. All he could see was Vale, making speeches. Vale, sitting at the head table of the cookhouse, calmly overseeing everything. His brother had never so much as tripped in front of the Tides. And what had Perry just done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the right thing, going after Old Will. So why couldn’t he slow down his breathing? Why did he feel like punching something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung open, banging against the stone wall with a crack and letting in a cold gust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perry?” someone said from below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry winced in disappointment. It wasn’t the voice he wanted to hear. The only one he’d listen to right now. Had Roar found her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not now, Cinder.” Perry listened for the sound of the door closing. Seconds passed with nothing. He tried again more forcefully. “Cinder, go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to explain about what happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry sat up. Cinder stood below, soaking wet. He was holding his black cap in his hands. He looked determined and calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to talk now?” Perry heard his father’s angry tone in his own voice. He knew he should stop himself, but he couldn’t. “You show up when you want to, and run when you don’t? Which is it going to be? If you’re staying, I’d appreciate you not burning our food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was trying to help—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to help?” Perry jumped down from the loft, muffling a curse as pain lanced through his arm. He strode up to Cinder, who stared up at him with wide, piercing eyes. He waved toward the open door. “Then why don’t you do something about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinder glanced outside, then back at him. “That’s why you want me here? You think I can stop the Aether?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry caught himself suddenly. He wasn’t thinking straight. Didn’t know what he was saying. He shook his head. “No. That’s not why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forget it!” Cinder backed away, moving toward the door. The veins at his neck had begun to glow blue, like the Aether. It seeped like branches beneath his skin, spreading up over his jaw, across his cheeks and his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry had seen him this way twice—on the day Cinder had burned his hand, and when he’d laid waste to a tribe of Croven—but it stunned him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never should have trusted you!” Cinder yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” Perry said. “I shouldn’t have said that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too late. Cinder spun, and shot outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar ran up a short while later, as Aria approached the compound with Molly. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” he said, wrapping Aria in a quick hug. “You made me worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry about that, pretty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be. I hate worrying.” He clutched Molly’s free arm, and together they pulled her as quickly as she could manage to the cookhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the tribe was packed together, crowding at the tables and along the walls. Molly left to check on River, and Roar went to see Bear. Aria spotted Twig, the lanky Aud who’d been with her on the journey there. She slid onto the bench beside him and scanned the buzzing hall. People were in a panic over the storm, talking over one another in brittle voices, their faces tight with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t surprised to see Brooke a few tables over with Wylan, the fisherman with dark, shifty eyes who’d cursed her under his breath at Perry’s house. She saw Willow nestled between her parents, with Old Will and Flea nearby, and the rest of the Six, who never strayed far from Perry’s side. As her gaze moved from one person to the next, a sense of dread rolled through her, making her fingertips tingle. She didn’t see Perry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar walked over and dropped a blanket over her shoulders. He edged Twig aside and sat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is he?” she asked plainly, too anxious for caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At his house. Bear said he knocked his shoulder out of joint. He’s fine.” Roar’s dark eyes flicked to her. “But it was close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s stomach clenched. Her ears latched onto Perry’s name drifting across the tables in a wave of whispers. She sifted through the din and grabbed onto Wylan’s spiteful tone, her eyes finding him again. A group of people had gathered around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“… he jumped in like an idiot. Reef had to fish him out. Almost didn’t get to him in time, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard he saved Old Will,” someone else said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWylan’s voice again. “Old Will wouldn’t have drowned! He knows the sea better than any of us. I was gonna get him on the line on my next cast. Right now I’d feel better if Flea were wearing that damned chain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria touched Roar’s arm. Do you hear Wylan? He’s horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar nodded. “He’s all bluster. You’re the only one who’s actually listening to him, trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria wasn’t sure about that. She wove her hands together, her leg bouncing beneath the table. Both the hearths blazed, warming the hall. It smelled of damp wool and mud, and the sweat of too many bodies. People had brought treasured belongings from their homes. She saw a doll. A quilt. Baskets packed with smaller items. An image appeared in her mind of the falcon carvings on the sill in Perry’s house. Then of Perry, there alone. She should be with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAether funnels struck outside, their distant shrieks carrying to her ears. Faint tremors vibrated up through the soles of her boots. She wondered if Cinder was out in the storm, but she knew that—of anyone—he’d be safe under the Aether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do we just sit here?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar ran a hand over his wet hair, making it spike. He nodded. “A storm this close, this is the safest place to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Marron’s, the storms hadn’t been nearly as frightening. Everyone in the compound retreated deep underground to the old mining caves of Delphi. There Marron had provisions at the ready. Even diversions, like music and games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother deep rumble thrummed through the floorboards. Aria looked up as dust shook loose from the rafters, sprinkling the table in front of her. In the cooking area, pots rattled softly. Nearby, Willow hugged Flea, her eyes shut tight. Aria hardly heard anyone talking now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for Roar again. You need to do something. They’re petrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar lifted an eyebrow. “I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, you. Perry’s not here, and I can’t. I’m a Mole, remember? No, wait. I’m a Mole tramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar stared at her, seeming to weigh his options. “All right. But you owe me.” He crossed the room to a young man with a cobra tattoo that wove around his neck, and nodded to the guitar leaning against the wall. “Can I borrow that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment of surprise, the young man handed over the instrument. Roar returned and sat up on the table, propping his feet on the long bench. He began testing the strings, his eyes narrowing in concentration as he adjusted the tension. He was meticulous, as she would’ve been. They both heard in perfect pitch. Anything less would’ve grated on their nerves. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-9.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
