For food. Sometimes those hunters are caught and sold at slave auctions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words settled between them like heavy stones, dragging them into the dark, thick mire of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to a slave auction,\" she bit out. \"Not as a slave to be sold, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery muscle in her beautiful body tensed. Was she pissed? Jealous? He wanted her to be jealous. Which was odd. He truly did despise jealousy in his lovers. He never allowed it or tolerated it. But Bride wanted so little from him, gave so little, he was latching on to every scrap she threw his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks like you\u0027ll be wiping away drool, after all. His jaw hardened with the thought. Hell. No. He was desired and craved throughout the galaxies. He was not a whipped schoolboy panting after a specific piece of ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re angry,\" she said with surprise. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden, frantic knock at the front door, and as it echoed through the bedroom, Bride paled and scrambled from the bed. She didn\u0027t bolt from the bedroom, though, but stood unsteadily, eyeing the exit with trepidation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he found himself asking, anger forgotten. Do not approach her. Do not put your hands on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do—do you think that\u0027s Aleaha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, hoping that would soothe her. \"I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s early, and I\u0027m not ready.\" Bride licked her lips, still not budging from that spot. \"What if... what if she ran from me, all those years ago, and has been hiding from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncertainty reminded him of the boy he\u0027d once been. The boy who had put on his best clothes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand snuck into his mother\u0027s wing of the palace to give her a birthday present. The boy who had knocked on his mother\u0027s door, hoping, praying for a smile, even a hug, when he gave her the picture he\u0027d drawn for her. The boy who\u0027d had to throw the gift away, because his mother had looked at it, thanked him, and placed it back in his hands before shutting the door in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She likes you, sweetheart. I swear it. She\u0027s been searching for you, intending to save you from my wrath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore knocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming, coming,\" Dallas shouted from the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did it take me so long to find her, then? Why did I only recently discover her scent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked so vulnerable, Devyn\u0027s heart actually swelled in his chest, aching, grinding against his ribs. He was at her side before he realized he\u0027d moved, wrapping his arms around her and drawing her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rested her head in the hollow of his neck, her tremors vibrating into him. Her night-wild scent wafted to his nose, and he breathed deeply. The silk of her hair tickled his chin. He\u0027d never held a woman like this. Just held her, an offer of comfort with no expectation of sex. As her hands gripped his back, as though she wanted to step inside him, be a part of him, he wondered why he\u0027d resisted such a thing. This was paradise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, Dev,\" Dallas called. \"Macy\u0027s here, and she\u0027s about to claw my face off for holding her back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then say good-bye to your face. We\u0027re not ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frowning Bride drew back. \"Macy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember. Aleaha took Macy\u0027s identity. Just be glad her boyfriend, Breean, isn\u0027t here. You\u0027d have to endure an interrogation before touching her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frown faded, leaving her vulnerable again. \"Does Breean know who she really is? Does he treat her right? Is he rich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he knows, and yes, he does. He loves her. And why do you care if he\u0027s rich?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We promised each other we\u0027d never marry anyone who was poor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s rich.\" I\u0027m richer, he wanted to add, but didn\u0027t. His finances didn\u0027t matter, as he\u0027d never remarry. \"Are we ready now? Macy will be happy to see you.\" If Macy turned him into a liar and did not welcome Bride the way she deserved, he was going to kill her. Slowly, painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send her in, Dal,\" he finally called. Even as he spoke, he moved away from Bride. His arms tingled where they\u0027d been in contact with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door flew open, and Macy raced inside. When she spotted Bride, she gasped and stopped. Her hands tented over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride gulped, then nervously licked her lips. Devyn had watched her take down a human slaver. She hadn\u0027t flinched or betrayed a hint of nerves when he\u0027d killed said slaver in front of her. But now, she was eaten up with worry. Over a friend who might not love her anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest started aching again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when tears filled her eyes, he almost fell to his knees. Tears had never affected him. How could they? Giving in to them would mean he was involved, not just with his body but with his mind. It would mean he harbored affection for the crier—affection he didn\u0027t understand or condone. But here, now, seeing Bride\u0027s emerald eyes liquefy ... he was struck with the urge to do anything and everything in his power to ensure she never had reason to cry again. What the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hurt her?\" Macy suddenly demanded of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"And I won\u0027t.\" Maybe. \"And before you ask, no, she\u0027s not a prisoner.\" Yet. The women looked at each other. Both remained silent, as if they were too afraid to speak. \"Hello, Aleaha,\" Bride finally said, gaze intense. \"You\u0027ve grown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trembling Macy nodded. \"Hello. You\u0027re just the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one of those tears splashed onto Bride\u0027s cheek, Devyn stepped toward her, meaning to comfort her again. But with a joyous cry, Macy suddenly ran past him and threw herself into Bride\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s you. It\u0027s really you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride\u0027s gaze met his for a split second, wonder in their depths. Then she was hugging Macy with all her might, crying harder, laughing, twirling. \"I can\u0027t believe I found you. I\u0027ve been looking so long. So damn long. I only stumbled on your scent a few weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been looking for you, too! I was afraid something had happened to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you go that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were talking over each other, but somehow he understood every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the officers had hung back while the others chased you,\" Macy explained. \"He found me and dragged me to their car. I escaped before they could lock me up, but someone else grabbed me and knocked me out. I woke up in a plane with other kids being carted God knows where. I had to take the identity of a guard, but managed to free the kids before working my way back to New Chicago. I looked for you but couldn\u0027t find you. I was afraid my scent had been buried underneath all the new identities I\u0027d taken, and I guess I was right. You only just started smelling me again, and I only just let myself be me again. Well, me and Macy. Breean helps me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Leah,\" Bride said, and Devyn had never heard her use such a gentle, loving, fiercely motherly tone. \"I\u0027m so sorry! Did anyone hurt you? Tell me their names, and I\u0027ll find and kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, I\u0027m fine. But what about you?\" Macy cupped Bride\u0027s cheeks and studied her face. \"Like I said, you\u0027re just the same, just as lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re ten times as lovely. Look at all that dark hair, those bright green eyes. And you have the breasts you always dreamed about having.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two shared a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she could see the woman underneath Macy\u0027s skin, Devyn realized. Impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I learned Devyn had found you, I almost died. I\u0027d been searching, had no luck, and suddenly he was on the hunt to bed you. Did he hurt you?\" Macy demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Her cheeks flushed to a pretty pink, and she flicked him a glance. He shrugged, sheepish. He\u0027d never made a secret of his desires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Bride said. \"I have your necklace.\" She removed it and anchored it around Macy\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women returned to their conversation, and he continued to watch them, strangely happy with the way things had turned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis phone vibrated, and he dug it out of his pocket. The number belonged to Breean. He was moaning inside as he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you would do the right thing,\" Breean said without preamble. \"You knew I had Bride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you were close to finding her and using my woman to do it. But I let you, because the end result was all that mattered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I had betrayed her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would have killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was stated so simply, Devyn knew the big guy had already planned it out. Just in case. Couldn\u0027t blame him, really. \"You would have tried,\" was all he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreean chuckled. \"You underestimated me once before, my friend, and I locked you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he had. In the end, Devyn had still won. \"You know, I\u0027m starting to like you. We should hang out more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreean choked, his breath crackling over the line. \"I won\u0027t bed you. Now or ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn rolled his eyes. \"As if you\u0027re handsome enough to win the likes of me.\" The thought of being with someone else, however, slipped into his mind and refused to leave. Bride was affecting him, and he didn\u0027t like it. Perhaps if he bedded another woman, he\u0027d stop thinking of Bride so intently. Perhaps he\u0027d stop this cursed softening. Once more, tears would no longer affect him, and jealousy would no longer delight him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. That\u0027s what he\u0027d do. Just as soon as he turned Bride over to AIR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride hadn\u0027t seen Devyn in days. Three days, eight hours, and twenty-seven minutes, to be exact. Three days, eight hours, and twenty-seven minutes she\u0027d spent inside AIR headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she\u0027d committed a crime by stealing Nolan, she wasn\u0027t a prisoner; they\u0027d oh, so nicely asked her to stay as Devyn had told her they would. They recognized her abilities and wanted her happy, but they also wanted easy access to her. Had she insisted on leaving, they would have caved on the issue, she was sure, but she hadn\u0027t. She stayed for Aleaha, who visited her every day. Or rather, Macy. That was the name her friend now used, so that was the name Bride needed to call her. By citing Macy as the reason for her compliance, she hopefully made Macy look good to those in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t like it was a hardship to stay. She had a comfortable bed, a small dresser with her changes of clothes, a portable enzyme shower, and a fridge and microwave for bags of plasma. Yeah, she was a pincushion, poked and prodded every few hours. It wasn\u0027t such a bad deal, though. The agents were surprisingly friendly and had honored her request for them not to wear perfume around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ... why hadn\u0027t Devyn checked on her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew the answer to that, she thought, fuming. He\u0027d had her. He\u0027d won. Like she\u0027d suspected, once a man like him got his target in bed, he became tired of her. The bastard. God, what a fool she was. She should have resisted harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paced the length of her cell, her boots digging into the tiles. There\u0027d been talk about him. She knew Devyn had taken some stupid female out on a date. A date! With the otherworlder, there was only one way that could have ended. In bed. Naked. Doing the things she and Devyn had done in her bed. Only more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoesn\u0027t matter. You knew it would end this way. Still, her fangs and nails were elongated, and what little blood coursed through her veins was like white lightning, sizzling, raising the fine hairs on the back of her neck and razing her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink of something else before you combust. She knew several AIR agents had moved into her apartment to keep track of Nolan, too afraid to transport him. How was he? Still healthy? She hoped so. He wasn\u0027t a bad guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only door to her cell slid open, and three female agents strode inside. One of them clutched a plastic basket filled with needles, tubes, and bandages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time for another withdrawal already?\" she moaned. She should tell them no more needle sticks for a while, but she did want them to find out if her blood was indeed a cure for Nolan\u0027s virus. If Al— Macy were ever infected, she wanted the cure available immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep, we\u0027re here for a little more juice,\" one of the girls said. \"Sorry.\" A pause, a frown. \"You look paler in person than you do on the monitors. Plasma not to your liking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" At this rate, she\u0027d be drained by the end of the week. The plasma had sickened her more than usual, and she\u0027d been unable to absorb even those first few little mouthfuls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery day she edged closer to starvation, and these women with their strong pulses weren\u0027t helping. They were a mouthwatering temptation, her tongue swelling for a taste. Don\u0027t drink from Macy\u0027s coworkers. Don\u0027t you dare drink from Macy\u0027s coworkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d offer to feed you,\" the second girl said, \"but Mia said we couldn\u0027t. She doesn\u0027t want our blood masking the effects of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride strode to the chair and table that had been set up for this type of thing. The woman with the basket moved in front of her, red hair fluttering around her chin; the other two moved behind Bride. They were the guard dogs, she suspected, just in case she went feral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all young, no older than thirty, and pretty in their own ways. What surprised her, though, was the fact that they didn\u0027t seem disgusted by her need for blood. They had shrugged off her dislike of the plasma and would have offered themselves if possible. Where was the horror she\u0027d always dreaded?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen you guys before,\" she remarked. Everyone who visited her was female, but never the same one twice. She\u0027d begun to wonder if there were any male agents besides Devyn and Dallas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a waiting list to meet you,\" one of the girls behind her said. \"We finally got our turn.\" A waiting list? For her? \"Why?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-22.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
