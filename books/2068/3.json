{"id":111255,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eAugust 21, 1864\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t stop thinking about her. I will not even write her name; I daren\u0027t. She is beautiful, entrancing, singular. When I\u0027m with Rosalyn, I am Giuseppe\u0027s son, the Salvatore boy, essentially interchangeable with Damon. I know it would not matter one whit to the Cartwrights if Damon took my place. It is only me because Father knew Damon would not stand for it, knew I would say yes, just like always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I saw her, her lithe figure, her red lips, her eyes that were flickering and sad and thrilling all at once ... it was as though I was finally just myself, just Stefan Salvatore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must be strong. I must treat her like a sister. I must fall in love with the woman who is to be my wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I fear it is already too late.... Rosalyn Salvatore, I thought to myself the next day, tasting the words as I walked out the door, ready to fulfill my duty by paying a second call on my soon-to-be-betrothed. I imagined living with Rosalyn in the carriage house--or perhaps some smaller mansion my father would build as our wedding present--me working all day, poring through ledgers with my father in his stuffy study, while she took care of our children. I tried to feel excitement. But all I felt was cold dread seeping through my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked around the grand path of Veritas and gazed wistfully up at the carriage house. I hadn\u0027t seen Katherine since she arrived yesterday afternoon. Father had dispatched Alfred to invite her to supper, but she\u0027d declined. I\u0027d spent the evening looking out the window toward the house, but I couldn\u0027t see any flicker of candlelight. If I hadn\u0027t known she and Emily had moved in, I\u0027d have assumed the house had remained unoccupied. Finally, I went to sleep, wondering the whole time what Katherine was doing and whether she needed comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tore my eyes away from the drawn upstairs shades and trudged down the driveway. The dirt road under my feet was hard and cracked; we needed a good rainstorm. There was no breeze, and the air felt dead. There wasn\u0027t another person outside as far as the eye could see, yet as I walked, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on walked, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and I got the uneasy feeling that I wasn\u0027t alone. Unbidden, Robert\u0027s warnings about walking off on my own floated through my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" I called out as I turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started. Standing just a few feet behind me, leaning against one of the angel statues that flanked the drive, was Katherine. She wore a white sunbonnet that protected her ivory skin and a white dress dotted with tiny rosebuds. Despite the heat, her fair skin looked as cool as the pond on a December morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at me, displaying perfectly straight, white teeth. \"I had hoped for a tour of the grounds, but it seems you are otherwise engaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pounded at the word \"engaged,\" the ring box in my back pocket as heavy as a branding iron. \"I\u0027m not ... no. I mean,\" I stammered, \"I could stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense.\" Katherine shook her head. \"I already am taking lodging from you and your father. I will not take your time as well.\" She raised a dark eyebrow at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever before had I spoken with a girl who seemed so at ease and sure of herself. I felt the sudden, overwhelming urge to whip the ring from my pocket and offer it to Katherine on one knee. But then I thought of Father and forced my hand to stay put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I at least walk with you for a bit?\" Katherine asked, swinging her sun umbrella back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanionably, we walked down the road. I kept glancing to my left and right, wondering why she didn\u0027t seem nervous to walk, unaccompanied, with a man. Perhaps it was because she was an orphan and so utterly alone in the world. Whatever the reason, I was grateful for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light wind blew around us, and I inhaled her lemony ginger scent, feeling as though I could die of happiness, right there, next to Katherine. Simply being near her was a reminder that beauty and love did exist in the world, even if I couldn\u0027t have them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I shall call you Silent Stefan,\" Katherine said as we walked through the cluster of oaks that marked the line between the village of Mystic Falls and the outlying plantations and estates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry ...,\" I started, fearing that I was as dull to her as Rosalyn was to me. \"It\u0027s simply that we don\u0027t get very many strangers in Mystic Falls. It\u0027s difficult to speak to someone who doesn\u0027t know my whole history. I suppose I don\u0027t want to bore you. After Atlanta, I\u0027m sure you find Mystic Falls a bit quiet.\" I felt mortified as soon as the sentence left my lips. Her parents had died in Atlanta, and here I was, making it sound like she\u0027d left some exciting life to live here. I cleared my throat. \"I mean, not that you had found Atlanta exciting, or that you wouldn\u0027t enjoy getting away exciting, or that you wouldn\u0027t enjoy getting away from everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine smiled. \"Thank you, Stefan. That\u0027s sweet.\" Her tone made it clear she didn\u0027t want to delve into the topic any further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked in silence for a few long moments. I kept my stride deliberately short so Katherine could keep up. Then, whether by accident or by design I\u0027m not sure, Katherine\u0027s fingers brushed against my arm. They were cold as ice, even in the humid air. \"Just so you know,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t find anything about you boring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy entire body flamed hot as a conflagration. I glanced up the road, as if trying to ascertain the best route for us to follow, though really I was hiding my blush from Katherine. I felt the weight of the ring in my pocket again, heavier than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to face Katherine, to say what, I\u0027m not even sure. But she was no longer by my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katherine?\" I called, shielding my eyes against the sun, waiting for her lilting laugh to rise up in the underbrush along the road. But all I heard was the echo of my own voice. She had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-origins-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-3.html","bookId":2068,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM"}
