In later life, Beranabus tracked the monster down and slaughtered him. He took the beast\u0027s head as a trophy. Held it close to his chest that night and wept for hours, stroking his dead father\u0027s face, hating and mourning him in equal measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera loved Dervish when they were younger. She wanted to marry him and have children. She dreamt of teaching their kids to be Disciples, the entire family battling evil together and saving the world. But she knew he would never father a baby. He was afraid any child of his might catch the curse of the Gradys and turn into a werewolf. So she never confessed her love or told anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReni saw her mother steal a purse from a shop. It was the most shocking thing she experienced until Loch died. She spent many restless nights wondering what else her mother might have stolen, worrying about what would happen if she was caught. She wanted to discuss it with someone, but it wasn\u0027t something she could talk about, so she kept it to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know these things because I\u0027ve touched those people and absorbed their inner thoughts. I\u0027m a human sponge-I soak up memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI became aware of my gift not long after I returned to life. I spent hours with Beranabus that night, hugging and holding him. Memories seeped into me thick and fast, but it was a time of great confusion and I wasn\u0027t able to separate his memories from Bill-E\u0027s until later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a few days to make sense of what happened. I had all these images of the distant past swirling around inside my head-starting with his wretched birth in the Labyrinth-and I wasn\u0027t sure where they\u0027d come from. When I worked it out, I thought it was a temporary side-effect of my miraculous return to life. Or maybe Beranabus had fed his memories to me, to help me cope with the new world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t touch anybody else until Meera hugged me, in an attempt to comfort me when she found me crying. As soon as we touched, I began absorbing. When I realised what was happening, I broke contact. I felt like a thief, stealing her innermost secrets. The flow of images stopped as soon as I let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learnt less about Meera than Beranabus, since we were in contact for only a handful of seconds. The flow of information was fast, but not instantaneous. I took many of her big secrets and recent memories, but little of her younger life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t touched anyone since then. I don\u0027t like this power. It\u0027s intrusive and sneaky, and I can\u0027t control it. I don\u0027t seem to do any harm. I think the person retains their memories, but I can\u0027t be certain. Maybe, if I held on for a long time, I\u0027d drain all their thoughts and they\u0027d end up a mindless zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I could experiment and find out more about my unwelcome gift, but I can\u0027t without the risk of damaging those I touch. If I was in the Demonata\u0027s universe, I could test it on demons- although I\u0027m not entirely sure I want to get inside a demon\u0027s head!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody knows about it. I\u0027d tell Beranabus if he was here, but he isn\u0027t. I could search for him-I learnt what he knew about opening windows when we touched, and I\u0027m sure I could open one myself-but I don\u0027t want to disturb him. He\u0027s on an important mission and this would distract him. If I\u0027m lucky, the unwelcome gift will fade with time. If not, what of it? I live in seclusion and almost never touch people. I\u0027m sure Reni Gossel won\u0027t come back for another face-to-face. What harm can a secluded hermit do to anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in Dervish\u0027s study, telling him about Bill-E\u0027s problems at school. Bill-E was a shy boy. He found it hard to make friends or fit in. Dervish wants to get to the root of his nephew\u0027s difficulties. There\u0027s no point-he can\u0027t do anything to fix them now-but he\u0027s persistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it his eye?\" Dervish asks. \"Billy had a lazy left eye. He often asked me to correct it with magic. If I had, would he have been more confident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Dervish presses angrily. \"You know. Don\u0027t pretend you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I feel like telling him to stop pestering me. I want to scream at him to stop obsessing about a dead boy and let me start living a life of my own. It\u0027s not fair that I\u0027m forced to spend my days and nights playing these sick games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dervish scares me. He\u0027s not big, but he\u0027s strong, I can see that in his pale blue eyes. He might hurt me if I crossed him. I\u0027m not sure how far he\u0027d go to keep learning about his nephew. Bill-E loved him unconditionally, so he saw only good things in this balding, bearded man. But Dervish has a tougher side which Bill-E never saw. I\u0027m afraid he might punish me if I annoy him. So I let my anger pass, bow my head in shame and mutter softly in response to his accusation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, because Bill-E didn\u0027t know. It was lots of things, all jumbled up. The death of his mum, his eye, just feeling different. There was no simple reason. If there had been, he could have dealt with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish studies me silently, face creased. Finally he nods, accepting my answer. He doesn\u0027t apologise for snapping at me-he doesn\u0027t see any need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he happier when Grubbs came?\" Dervish asks, leaning back in his chair. We\u0027ve talked about this before. We\u0027ve covered most of Bill-E\u0027s life. The only part we\u0027ve never touched on is the night of his death. Dervish never asks about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say, raising my head and flashing a short smile across the table. I know Dervish likes hearing about Bill-E\u0027s lighter moments, his friendship with Grubbs, hunting for buried treasure, life with his mum before she died. \"Grubbs was his best friend ever, even though they didn\u0027t know each other for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he suspect they were brothers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He sometimes wished they were, but he never had any idea who his true father was. He thought it was you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish flinches. I knew, even as I was saying it, that I shouldn\u0027t. He feels guilty about not telling Bill-E the truth. He doesn\u0027t like to imagine he was the cause of any unhappiness in his nephew\u0027s short life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough for now,\" Dervish mutters, turning away from me, switching on his computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up and edge around the desk. My gaze settles on Dervish\u0027s narrow back. I feel an almost irresistible urge to put a hand between his shoulder blades. Partly I want to touch him just to make contact, to say, \"I\u0027m real. I have feelings. See me.\" But mostly I want to absorb his memories and secrets, learn what makes him tick. If I knew more about him, maybe I needn\u0027t be so afraid. I might find some way to break through the barriers he\u0027s erected and make him see me as a person, not just a direct line to his dead nephew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that would be wrong. I\u0027d be stealing. I already feel bad for unintentionally taking from Beranabus, Meera and Reni. I won\u0027t do it on purpose, not even to make life easier for myself. So I slide out wordlessly, leaving Dervish hunched over the computer, his secrets intact, the coldness between us preserved. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-5.html","bookId":2181,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM"}
