{"id":68210,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the footsteps of a crowd. Faraway chatter. Someone was coming. David stopped and motioned for his gang to halt. At the far junction, he saw Freaks, three of them, walking through the intersecting hallway. They passed through the junction without seeing the Loners. He waved the Loners back and reversed his steps as quietly as he could. More Freaks crossed ahead. If the Loners could back up into the dark section of the hallway, they could remain undetected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid glanced at his gang behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all Will. A wide hallway of convulsing Wills stood gagging behind him, their eyes rolling white, a froth of saliva shaking out of their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“LONERRRRRS!” yelled a Freak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horde of Freaks flooded into the hallway and charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wore black, and their faces and arms were completely blacked out with some sort of paint. The chemical blue of their hair looked even more unnatural against their charcoal faces. Some wore swimming goggles. They carried scimitar-shaped shards of shattered blackboard with handles made of desk legs. The Loners sank into fighting stances. David saw an avalanche of blue fall toward him. The Loners ran forward; their white heads penetrated the blue mass. Violence exploded through the hall. David pulled a pipe from his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe prayed that whatever he swung it at was real. A blue-hair sliced his blackboard scimitar down at him. David blocked it with the pipe. The blackboard shattered, and the impact rattled the bones in David’s hand. The pain in his wrist was no hallucination. David clung to that pain. He swung his pipe into the kid’s hip. The kid fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid hacked away at whoever came near. He took down a Freak who swung a rope with a brick tied into its end. A blue-bearded Freak swung a two-by-four that had nails driven through it, into the back of a Loner next to David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid saw a human skeleton weaving through the riot. It shoved people out of its way, throwing its bones into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had no jaw. There was a hammer clutched in its fleshless fingers. The skeleton turned to him. Dead, empty eye sockets locked onto David. It ran at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chair smacked into the back of David’s knees. He thudded down to the ground on his stomach. He whipped around onto his back. Ritchie was dragging a chair-wielding Freak away from David. David got up on one knee. The skeleton appeared above him, hammer raised high over its cracked skull. A wet, pink tongue extended out from the shadows under its upper teeth. It screeched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid gripped his pipe with both hands and put everything into one swing, chopping his pipe up into its dead head. The front of the skeleton’s skull, its bony face, broke off and flew over the heads of the feuding gangs. The skeleton thumped down on the floor next to David. It was Bobby. He was unconscious. It took David three blinks for him to see it clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby wore the front half of a plastic rib cage from a biology classroom skeleton over his black shirt. The skeleton’s bony face had been his mask. David stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle still thrashed around him. Blue and white hair was now stained with red. The Freaks had pushed the Loners back,into the darkened section of the hall again. Will and Ritchie struggled against four Freaks. Loners were out-numbered by Freaks, twofold. They were giving everything they had in David’s name, but they weren’t going to last much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me, come and get me!” David hollered to the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Freaks all looked at David. Time to run. He bolted away from the Freaks, around a corner and into a narrow hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed hard against a row of lockers. His depth percep-tion was jacked. He heard a wailing mob bottleneck through the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallway was a cluttered dumping ground. The Skaters hadn’t picked up garbage for weeks. He tripped over a stack of torn-up carpet and fell into a pile of trash. He fumbled to get to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGotta slow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn’t. He glanced behind. The Freaks were bearing down on him fast. He collided with a tangle of desks and leapt over a plump garbage bag to keep his footing. He careened off one object and then another, always close to falling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Freaks shouted after him and threw things out of their way. The hallway narrowed around David as he ran. The walls squeezed in on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the doors were swinging open and slamming shut of their own accord. For a moment, he saw a bloodred elk running by his side. The noise behind him sounded like a stampede of screaming elephants. The noise swelled until David thought it was coming from inside his head instead of behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid tripped on a gallon milk jug full of piss, and ate it into a pile of pallets. Pain. He looked back. The churning mass of Freaks was only twenty feet behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid bolted up and hooked a left. There it was: the entrance of the cafeteria. It gleamed for him like heaven’s gate. He passed two Sluts taking out their garbage. Two more stood guard ahead of him by the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” one yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t explain. The guards reached out to try to stop him, but he ran through them, knocking the girls aside, and tumbled to a stop inside the cafeteria, in front of a crowd of Sluts. They rose to their feet and shouted at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut the doors! Shut the doors!” David shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViolent cut through the crowd to meet David, her face twisted in anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t just run past my guards like that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Freaks!” David yelled, trying to catch his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re coming!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue-haired army rounded the corner and charged into the cafeteria. The Sluts ran at the Freaks with whatever they could grab, and the two gangs ripped into each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cafeteria was pure carnage. David punched at whatever Freak came at him and kept moving. The Sluts fought to get the invaders out. There were too many bodies to discern who was who anymore. He planted his feet. The people in front of him looked like two-dimensional cutouts. He swung his pipe and bashed it against anything solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother entrance to the cafeteria burst open. A hundred Freaks rushed through. The doors of a third cafeteria entrance toppled over. Throngs of Freaks flooded in. The cafeteria filled with blue-haired psychos, hundreds and hundreds of them, charging toward David. He swung his pipe wildly, smashing it into one Freak after another. For every Freak he knocked to the ground, five more would attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on all sides, they pulled the pipe from his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched, he elbowed, he kicked. They clawed into him, tearing at his skin, biting his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“David!” someone yelled from behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid spun around. Will stood in front of him. The Freaks were gone. Disappeared. In the blink of an eye, there wasn’t one head of blue hair in the whole cafeteria. There were Loners and angry Sluts standing all around him. They stared at him like he was a mad homeless man shouting at a bush. He lowered his fists. He felt sick, weak, scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” David asked Will in a hushed tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We forced the Freaks out. Us and the Sluts.” “And what did I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill lowered his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You kept fighting. After they were gone, you fought us.” David looked past the angry people surrounding him. The cafeteria was in shambles. Injured Loners and Sluts rocked and writhed on the ground like maggots in a trash bag. Mort clutched his blood-soaked stomach. He saw a Slut lying on a dining table with a six-inch shard of blackboard protruding from her chest. Violent was sharpening her knives and glar-ing at David, furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not part of the deal, David!” she shouted. “Not part of the deal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill stared up at David as though he was expecting an order. David couldn’t be trusted to give them anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pulled Will in close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will. I need your help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWILL WAS IN FRONT, LEADING THE CLIMB up the stairs to the library. David clung tightly to his arm. His one eye trembled. Violent and twenty-five heavily armed Sluts were behind them, followed by the Loners, who carried any wounded who couldn’t walk. Ritchie and two other Loners carried the Slut with the chest wound. She moaned and sputtered and coughed. Ten more Sluts brought up the rear. They all climbed as fast as their battered bodies could carry them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This sucks,” Ritchie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill agreed, but he didn’t know what else to do. The old plan was to cross the Freaks’ territory to get to the ruins. They couldn’t go back into Freak territory without another battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other way was to go to the third floor and cross over the top of the Freaks’ territory, through the library. David sold Violent on the chance of escape, so she agreed to escort them. She left half of her girls to guard the cafeteria and brought the other half with her to see if this exit was for real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill prayed the exit was real. If it turned out not to be, he didn’t think he would be able to hold David’s hand in those last moments, or tell him everything would be all right, when he knew it was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pick up the pace, David,” Violent said behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” Will whispered to David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViolent claimed she had an arrangement with the Nerds and could get them through. Back at the cafeteria, David assured Will that he knew, without a doubt, that Violent was telling the truth and could deliver on what she said. Once in the library, they would drop off their wounded and continue through to the other side, then down the stairs and into the ruins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you saw this way out, Will?” Violent said, walking up beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw a dog that found a way in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, there was . . . what, like, a hole?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you go in the hole?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViolent grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Will couldn’t find the exit, or if that dog had somehow been in here with them since the quarantine, he knew they’d all turn on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid spasmed as he took the next step and fell back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m gonna die!” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shivering. His bulging eye looked like a hard-boiled egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’re not,” Will insisted. He turned to everyone behind them. “He’s not. He’s fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill reached out for David, but David swatted his hand away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-loners-quarantine-1/page-43.html","bookId":1722,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:28 AM"}
