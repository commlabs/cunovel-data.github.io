Another Mercedes, this one a limo, black, is double-parked next to the white one. There\u0027s more lightning. An ambulance screams down Fourteenth Street. McDermott walks by Daisy and kisses her hand before hopping in the second cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m left standing in front of the crying black woman, Daisy staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I mutter, then, \"Here...\" I hand the black woman a book of matches from Lutece before realizing the mistake, then find a book of matches from Tavern on the Green and toss them at the kid and pluck the other matchbook from her dirty, scabbed fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I mutter again, walking over to Daisy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no more cabs,\" she says, hands on hips. Another flash of lightning causes her to jerk her head around, whining, \"Where\u0027s the photo graphers? Who\u0027s taking the pic tures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taxi!\" I whistle, trying to wave down a passing cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bolt of lighting rips across the sky above Zeckendorf Towers and Daisy squeals, \"Where is the photographer? Patrick. Tell them to stop.\" She\u0027s confused, her head moving left, right, behind, left, right She lowers her sunglasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god,\" I mutter, my voice building to a shout. \"It\u0027s light ning. Not a photographer. Lightning!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh right, I\u0027m supposed to believe you. You said Gorbachev was downstairs,\" she says accusingly. \"I don\u0027t believe you. I think the press is here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, here\u0027s a cab. Hey, taxi.\" I whistle at an oncoming cab that has just turned off Eighth Avenue, but someone taps my shoulder and when I turn around, Bethany, a girl I dated at Harvard and who I was subsequently dumped by, is standing in front of me wearing a lace-embroidered sweater and viscose-crepe trousers by Christian Lacroix, an open white umbrella in one hand. The cab I was trying to hail whizzes by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bethany,\" I say, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick.\" She smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bethany,\" I say again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, Patrick?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, well, um, I\u0027m fine,\" I stutter, after an awkward byte of silence. \"And you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really well, thanks,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know... well, were you in there?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I was.\" She nods, then, \"It\u0027s good to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you... living here?\" I ask, gulping. \"In Manhattan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She smiles. \"I\u0027m working at Milbank Tweed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well... great.\" I look back over at Daisy and I\u0027m suddenly angry, remembering the lunch in Cambridge, at Quarters, where Bethany, her arm in a sling, a faint bruise above her cheek, ended it all, then, just as suddenly, I\u0027m thinking: My hair, oh god, my hair, and I can feel the drizzle ruining it. \"Well, I gotta go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re at P \u0026amp; P, right?\" she asks, then, \"You look great.\" Spotting another cab approaching, I back away. \"Yeah, well, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have lunch,\" she calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could be more fun?\" I say, unsure. The cab has noticed Daisy and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome black guy has opened the cab door for Daisy and she steps in daintily and the black guy holds it open for me too while I get in, waving, nodding to Bethany. \"A tip, mister,\" the black guy asks, \"from you and the pretty lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I growl, trying to check my hair in the cabdriver\u0027s rearview mirror. \"Here\u0027s a tip: get a real job, you dumb f**king nigger.\" Then I slam the door myself and tell the cabdriver to take us to the Upper West Side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you think it was interesting in that movie tonight how they were spies but they weren\u0027t spies?\" Daisy asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can drop her off in Harlem,\" I tell the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in my bathroom, shirtless in front of the Orobwener mirror, debating whether to take a shower and wash my hair since it looks shitty due to the rain. Tentatively I smooth some mousse into it then run a comb over the mousse. Daisy sits in the Louis Montoni brass and chrome chair by the futon, spooning Macadamia Brittle Haagen-Dazs ice cream into her mouth. She is wearing only a lace bra and a garter belt from Bloomingdale\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she calls out, \"my ex-boyfriend Fiddler, at the party earlier tonight, he couldn\u0027t understand what I was doing there with a yuppie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not really listening, but while staring at my hair, I manage, \"Oh. Really?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-90.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
