{"id":16594,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X THE IRISH ELYSIUM AND BELIEF IN REBIRTH","content":"C?sar, writing some fifty years before Christ about the Gauls and their Druids, tells his countrymen that one of the prime articles which they taught was that men\u0027s souls do not die—non interire animas—\"but passed over after death from one into another,\" and their opinion is, adds C?sar, that this doctrine \"greatly tends to the arousing of valour, all fear of death being despised.\"[1] A few years later Diodorus Siculus wrote that one of their doctrines was \"that the souls of men are undying, and that after finishing their term of existence they pass into another body,\" adding that at burials of the dead some actually cast letters addressed to their departed relatives upon the funeral pile, under the belief that the dead would read them in the next world. Timagenes, a Greek who wrote a history of Gaul now lost, Strabo, Valerius Maximus, Pomponius Mela, and Lucan[2] in his \"Pharsalia,\" all have passages upon this vivid belief of the Gauls that the soul lived again. This doctrine must also have been current in Britain, where the Druidic teaching was, to use C?sar\u0027s phrase,[Pg 95] \"discovered, and thence brought into Gaul,\" and it would have been curious indeed if Ireland did not share in it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is, moreover, abundant evidence to show that the doctrine of metempsychosis was perfectly familiar to the pagan Irish, as may be seen in the stories of the births of Cuchulain, Etain, the Two Swineherds, Conall Cearnach, Tuan Mac Cairill, and Aedh Sláne.[3] But there is not, in our existing literature, any evidence that the belief was ever elevated into a philosophical doctrine of general acceptance, applicable to every one, still less that there was ever any ethical stress laid upon the belief in rebirth. It is only the mythological element in the belief in metempsychosis which has come down to us, and from which we ascertain that the pagan Irish believed that supernatural beings could become clothed in flesh and blood, could enter into women and be born again, could take different shapes and pass through different stages of existence, as fowls, animals, or men. What the actual doctrinal form of the familiar idea was, or how far it influenced the popular mind, we have no means of knowing. But as Mr. Nutt well remarks, \"early Irish religion must have possessed some ritual, and what in default of an apter term must be styled philosophical as well as mythological elements. Practically the latter alone have come down to us, and that in a romantic rather than in a strictly mythical form. Could we judge Greek religion aright if fragments of Apollodorus or the \u0027Metamorphoses\u0027 were all that survived of the literature it inspired?\"[4] The most that can be said upon the subject, then, is that the doctrine of rebirth was actually taught with a deliberate ethical purpose—that of making men brave, since on being slain in this life they passed into a new one—amongst the Celts of Gaul, that it must have been familiar to the Britons between whose Druids and those of Gaul so close a resemblance subsisted, and that the idea of rebirth which[Pg 96] forms part of half-a-dozen existing Irish sagas, was perfectly familiar to the Irish Gael, although we have no evidence that it was connected with any ritual or taught as a deliberate doctrine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In reconstructing from our existing literature the beliefs and religion of our ancestors, we can only do so incompletely, and with difficulty, from passages in the oldest sagas and other antique fragments, mostly of pagan origin, from allusions in very early poems, from scanty notices in the annals, and from the lives of early saints. The relatively rapid conversion of the island to Christianity in the fifth century, and the enthusiasm with which the new religion was received, militated against any full transmission of pagan belief or custom. We cannot now tell whether all the ancient Irish were imbued with the same religious beliefs, or whether these varied—as they probably did—from tribe to tribe. Probably all the Celtic races, even in their most backward state, believed—so far as they had any persuasion on the subject at all—in the immortality of the soul. Where the souls of the dead went to, when they were not reincarnated, is not so clear. They certainly believed in a happy Other-World, peopled by a happy race, whither people were sometimes carried whilst still alive, and to gain which they either traversed the sea to the north-west, or else entered one of the Sidh [Shee] mounds, or else again dived beneath the water.[5] In all cases, however, whatever the mode of access, the result is much the same. A beautiful country is discovered[Pg 97] where a happy race free from care, sickness, and death, spend the smiling hours in simple, sensuous pleasures.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is a graphic description of this Elysium in the \"Voyage of Bran,\" a poem evidently pagan,[6] and embodying purely pagan conceptions. A mysterious female, an emissary from the lovely land, appears in Bran\u0027s household one day, when the doors were closed and the house full of chiefs and princes, and no one knew whence she came, and she chanted to them twenty-eight quatrains describing the delights of the pleasant country.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is a distant isle\n\u003cbr\u003e Around which sea-horses glisten,\n\u003cbr\u003e A fair course against the white-swelling surge,\n\u003cbr\u003e Four feet uphold it.[7]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Feet of white bronze under it,\n\u003cbr\u003e Glittering through beautiful ages.\n\u003cbr\u003e Lovely land throughout the world\u0027s age\n\u003cbr\u003e On which the many blossoms drop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An ancient tree there is with blossoms\n\u003cbr\u003e On which birds call to the Hours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Tis in harmony, it is their wont\n\u003cbr\u003e To call together every Hour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;

How exquisite the idea of being transported from this world to an isle around which sea-horses glisten, where from trees covered with blossoms the birds call in harmony to the Hours, a land whose haze is incomparable!

But it is impossible to say whether rebirth with life in another world, for those whom the gods favoured, was taught as a doctrine or had any ethical significance attached to it by the druids of Ireland, as it most undoubtedly had by their cousins the druids of Gaul.\n\u003cbr\u003e ********\n\u003cbr\u003e [1] \"De Bello Gallico,\" vi. 14.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [2] See \"Voyage of Bran,\" vol. ii. pp. 107-111, where all these passages have been lucidly collected by Mr. Nutt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [3] All of these have been studied by Mr. Nutt, chap. xiv.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [4] Vol. ii. p. 121.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [5] In a large collection of nearly sixty folk-lore stories taken down in Irish from the lips of the peasantry, I find about five contain allusions to the belief in another world full of life under water, and about four in a life in the inside of the hills.

An old Irish expression for dying is going \"to the army of the dead,\" used by Déirdre in her lament, and I find a variant of it so late as the beginning of this century, in a poem by Raftery, a blind musician of the county Mayo, who tells his countrymen to remember that they must go \"to the meadow of the dead.\" See Raftery\u0027s \"Aithreachas,\" in my \"Religious Songs of Connacht,\" p. 266.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [6] Admirably translated by Kuno Meyer, who says \"there are a large number of [word] forms in the \u0027Voyage of Bran,\u0027 as old as any to be found in the Wurzburg Glosses,\" and these Professor Thurneysen ascribes unhesitatingly to the seventh century. Zimmer also agrees that the piece is not later than the seventh century, that is, was first written down in the seventh century, but this is no criterion of the date of the original composition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [7] I give Kuno Meyer\u0027s translation: in the original—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fil inis i n-eterchéin\n\u003cbr\u003e Immataitnet gabra rein\n\u003cbr\u003e Rith find fris tóibgel tondat\n\u003cbr\u003e Ceitheóir cossa foslongat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In modern Irish the first two lines would run\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"[Go] bhfuil inis i n-idir-chéin\n\u003cbr\u003e Urn a dtaithnigeann gabhra réin.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Réin being the genitive of rian, \"the sea,\" which, according to M. d\u0027Arbois, the Gaels brought with them as a reminiscence of the Rhine, see above p. 10.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [8] Preserved in the Leabhar na h-Uidhre, a MS. compiled from older ones about the year 1100.
