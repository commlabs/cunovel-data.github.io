{"id":10305,"no":134,"title":"CHAPTER 134","content":"By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms, Prince Joffrey is his rightful heir, and Tommen after him... and we are all traitors, however good our reasons.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Renly laughed. “You must forgive Lady Catelyn, Stannis. She’s come all the way down from Riverrun, a long way ahorse. I fear she never saw your little letter.”\u0026nbsp; “Joffrey is not my brother’s seed,” Stannis said bluntly. “Nor is Tommen. They are bastards. The girl as well. All three of them abominations born of incest.”\u0026nbsp; Would even Cersei be so mad? Catelyn was speechless.\u0026nbsp; “Isn’t that a sweet story, my lady?” Renly asked. “I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received his letter, and I must say, it took my breath away.” He smiled at his brother. “I had never suspected you were so clever, Stannis. Were it only true, you would indeed be Robert’s heir.”\u0026nbsp; “Were it true? Do you name me a liar?”\u0026nbsp; “Can you prove any word of this fable?”\u0026nbsp; Stannis ground his teeth.\u0026nbsp; Robert could never have known, Catelyn thought, or Cersei would have lost her head in an instant. “Lord Stannis,” she asked, “if you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes, why did you keep silent? “\u0026nbsp; “I did not keep silent,” Stannis declared. “I brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn.”\u0026nbsp; “Rather than your own brother?”\u0026nbsp; “My brother’s regard for me was never more than dutiful,” said Stannis. “From me, such accusations would have seemed peevish and selfserving, a means of placing myself first in the line of succession. I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn, whom he loved.”\u0026nbsp; “Ah,” said Renly. “So we have the word of a dead man.”\u0026nbsp; “Do you think he died by happenstance, you purblind fool? Cersei had him poisoned, for fear he would reveal her. Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs-”\u0026nbsp; “-which doubtless died with him. How inconvenient.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn was remembering, fitting pieces together. “My sister Lysa accused the queen of killing her husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell,” she admitted. “Later, in the Eyrie, she laid the murder at the feet of the queen’s brother Tyrion.”\u0026nbsp; Stannis snorted. “If you step in a nest of snakes, does it matter which one bites you first?”\u0026nbsp; “All this of snakes and incest is droll, but it changes nothing. You may well have the better claim, Stannis, but I still have the larger army.” Renly’s hand slid inside his cloak. Stannis saw, and reached at once for the hilt of his sword, but before he could draw steel his brother produced... a peach. “Would you like one, brother?” Renly asked, smiling. “From Highgarden. You’ve never tasted anything so sweet, I promise you.” He took a bite. Juice ran from the corner of his mouth.\u0026nbsp; “I did not come here to eat fruit.” Stannis was fuming.\u0026nbsp; “My lords!” Catelyn said. “We ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance, not trading taunts.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “A man should never refuse to taste a peach,” Renly said as he tossed the stone away. “He may never get the chance again. Life is short, Stannis. Remember what the Starks say. Winter is coming.” He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\u0026nbsp; “I did not come here to be threatened, either.”\u0026nbsp; “Nor were you,” Renly snapped back. “When I make threats, you’ll know it. If truth be told, I’ve never liked you, Stannis, but you are my own blood, and I have no wish to slay you. So if it is Storm’s End you want, take it... as a brother’s gift. As Robert once gave it to me, I give it to YOU.”\u0026nbsp; “It is not yours to give. It is mine by rights.”\u0026nbsp; Sighing, Renly half turned in the saddle. “What am I to do with this brother of mine, Brienne? He refuses my peach, he refuses my castle, he even shunned my wedding...”\u0026nbsp; “We both know your wedding was a mummer’s farce. A year ago you were scheming to make the girl one of Robert’s whores.”\u0026nbsp; “A year ago I was scheming to make the girl Robert’s queen,” Renly said, “but what does it matter? The boar got Robert and I got Margaery. You’ll be pleased to know she came to me a maid.”\u0026nbsp; “In your bed she’s like to die that way.”\u0026nbsp; “Oh, I expect I’ll get a son on her within the year. Pray, how many sons do you have, Stannis? Oh, yes-none.” Renly smiled innocently. “As to your daughter, I understand. If my wife looked like yours, I’d send my fool to service her as well.”\u0026nbsp; “Enough!” Stannis roared. “I will not be mocked to my face, do you hear me? I will not!” He yanked his longsword from its scabbard. The steel gleamed strangely bright in the wan sunlight, now red, now yellow, now blazing white. The air around it seemed to shimmer, as if from heat.\u0026nbsp; Catelyn’s horse whinnied and backed away a step, but Brienne moved between the brothers, her own blade in hand. “Put up your steel!” she shouted at Stannis.\u0026nbsp; Cersei Lannister is laughing herself breathless, Catelyn thought wearily.\u0026nbsp; Stannis pointed his shining sword at his brother. “I am not without mercy,” thundered he who was notoriously without mercy. “Nor do I wish to sully Lightbringer with a brother’s blood. For the sake of the mother who bore us both, I will give you this night to rethink your folly, Renly. Strike your banners and come to me before dawn, and I will grant you Storm’s End and your old seat on the council and even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise, I shall destroy you.”\u0026nbsp; Renly laughed. “Stannis, that’s a very pretty sword, I’ll grant you, but I think the glow off it has ruined your eyes. Look across the fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?”\u0026nbsp; “Do you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?”\u0026nbsp; “Tyrell swords will make me king. Rowan and Tarly and Caron will make me king, with axe and mace and warhammer. Tarth arrows and Penrose lances, Fossoway, Cuy, Mullendore, Estermont, Selmy, Hightower, Oakheart, Crane, Caswell, Blackbar, Morrigen, Beesbury, Shermer, Dunn, Footly... even House Florent, your own wife’s brothers and uncles, they will make me king. All the chivalry of the south rides with me, and that is the least part of my power.\u0026nbsp; My foot is coming behind, a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes. And you will destroy me? With what, pray? That paltry rabble I see there huddled under the castle walls? I’ll call them five thousand and be generous, codfish lords and onion knights and sellswords. Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts. You have fewer than four hundred horse, my scouts tell me-freeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances. I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are, Stannis, that host of yours won’t survive the first charge of my vanguard.”\u0026nbsp; “We shall see, brother.” Some of the light seemed to go out of the world when Stannis slid his sword back into its scabbard. “Come the dawn, we shall see.”\u0026nbsp; “I hope your new god’s a merciful one, brother.”\u0026nbsp; Stannis snorted and galloped away, disdainful. The red priestess lingered a moment behind. “Look to your own sins, Lord Renly,” she said as she wheeled her horse around.\u0026nbsp; Catelyn and Lord Renly returned together to the camp where his thousands and her few waited their return. “That was amusing, if not terribly profitable,” he commented. “I wonder where I can get a sword like that? Well, doubtless Loras will make me a gift of it after the battle. it grieves me that it must come to this.”\u0026nbsp; “You have a cheerful way of grieving,” said Catelyn, whose distress was not feigned.\u0026nbsp; “Do I?” Renly shrugged. “So be it. Stannis was never the most cherished of brothers, I confess. Do you suppose this tale of his is true? If Joffrey is the Kingslayer’s get-”\u0026nbsp; “-your brother is the lawful heir.”\u0026nbsp; “While he lives,” Renly admitted. “Though it’s a fool’s law, wouldn’t you agree? Why the oldest son, and not the best-fitted? The crown will suit me, as it never suited Robert and would not suit Stannis. I have it in me to be a great king, strong yet generous, clever, just, diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of forgiveness, patient-”\u0026nbsp; “-humble?” Catelyn supplied.\u0026nbsp; Renly laughed. “You must allow a king some flaws, my lady.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn felt very tired. It had all been for nothing. The Baratheon brothers would drown each other in blood while her son faced the Lannisters alone, and nothing she could say or do would stop it. It is past time I went back to Riverrun to close my father’s eyes, she thought. That much at least I can do. I may be a poor envoy, but I am a good mourner, gods save me.\u0026nbsp; Their camp was well sited atop a low stony ridge that ran from north to south. It was far more orderly than the sprawling encampment on the Mander, though only a quarter as large. When he’d learned of his brother’s assault on Storm’s End, Renly had split his forces, much as Robb had done at the Twins. His great mass of foot he had left behind at Bitterbridge with his young queen, his wagons, carts, draft animals, and all his cumbersome siege machinery, while Renly himself led his knights and freeriders in a swift dash east.\u0026nbsp; How like his brother Robert he was, even in that... only Robert had always had Eddard Stark to temper his boldness with caution. Ned would surely have prevailed upon Robert to bring up his whole force, to encircle Stannis and besiege the besiegers. That choice Renly had denied himself in his headlong rush to come to grips with his brother. He had outdistanced his supply lines, left\u0026nbsp; food and forage days behind with all his wagons and mules and oxen. He must come to battle soon, or starve.\u0026nbsp; Catelyn sent Hal Mollen to tend to their horses while she accompanied Renly back to the royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment. Inside the walls of green silk, his captains and lords bannermen were waiting to hear word of the parley. “My brother has not changed,” their young king told them as Brienne unfastened his cloak and lifted the goldand-jade crown from his brow. “Castles and courtesies will not appease him, he must have blood. Well, I am of a mind to grant his wish.”\u0026nbsp; “Your Grace, I see no need for battle here,” Lord Mathis Rowan put in. “The castle is strongly garrisoned and well provisioned, Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander, and the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of Storm’s End. Let Lord Stannis have his siege. He will find no joy in it, and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless, we will take King’s Landing.”\u0026nbsp; “And have men say I feared to face Stannis?”\u0026nbsp; “Only fools will say that,” Lord Mathis argued.\u0026nbsp; Renly looked to the others. “What say you all?”\u0026nbsp; “I say that Stannis is a danger to you,” Lord Randyll Tarly declared. “Leave him unblooded and he will only grow stronger, while your own power is diminished by battle. The Lannisters will not be beaten in a day. By the time you are done with them, Lord Stannis may be as strong as you... or stronger.”\u0026nbsp; Others chorused their agreement. The king looked pleased. “We shall fight, then.”\u0026nbsp; I have failed Robb as I failed Ned, Catelyn thought. “My lord,” she announced. “If you are set on battle, my purpose here is done. I ask your leave to return to Riverrun.”\u0026nbsp; “You do not have it.” Renly seated himself on a camp chair.\u0026nbsp; She stiffened. “I had hoped to help you make a peace, my lord. I will not help you make a war.” Renly gave a shrug. “I daresay we’ll prevail without your five-an-twenty, my lady. I do not mean for you to take part in the battle, only to watch it.”\u0026nbsp; “I was at the Whispering Wood, my lord. I have seen enough butchery. I came here an envoy-”\u0026nbsp; “And an envoy you shall leave,” Renly said, “but wiser than you came. You shall see what befalls rebels with your own eyes, so your son can hear it from your own lips. We’ll keep you safe, never fear.” He turned away to make his dispositions. “Lord Mathis, you shall lead the center of my main battle. Bryce, you’ll have the left. The right is mine. Lord Estermont, you shall command the reserve.”\u0026nbsp; “I shall not fail you, Your Grace,” Lord Estermont replied.\u0026nbsp; Lord Mathis Rowan spoke up. “Who shall have the van?”\u0026nbsp; “Your Grace,” said Ser Jon Fossoway, “I beg the honor.”\u0026nbsp; “Beg all you like,” said Ser Guyard the Green, “by rights it should be one of the seven who strikes the first blow.”\u0026nbsp; “It takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall,” Randyll Tarly announced. “I was leading Mace Tyrell’s van when you were still sucking on your mother’s teat, Guyard.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; A clamor filled the pavilion, as other men loudly set forth their claims. The knights of summer, Catelyn thought. Renly raised a hand. “Enough, my lords. If I had a dozen vans, all of you should have one, but the greatest glory by rights belongs to the greatest knight. Ser Loras shall strike the first blow.”\u0026nbsp; “With a glad heart, Your Grace.” The Knight of Flowers knelt before the king. “Grant me your blessing, and a knight to ride beside me with your banner. Let the stag and rose go to battle side by side.”\u0026nbsp; Renly glanced about him. “Brienne.”\u0026nbsp; “Your Grace?” She was still armored in her blue steel, though she had taken off her helm. The crowded tent was hot, and sweat plastered limp yellow hair to her broad, homely face. “My place is at your side. I am your sworn shield...”\u0026nbsp; “One of seven,” the king reminded her. “Never fear, four of your fellows will be with me in the fight.”\u0026nbsp; Brienne dropped to her knees. “If I must part from Your Grace, grant me the honor of arming you for battle.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn heard someone snigger behind her. She loves him, poor thing, she thought sadly. She’d play his squire just to touch him, and never care how great a fool they think her.\u0026nbsp; “Granted,” Renly said. “Now leave me, all of you. Even kings must rest before a battle.”\u0026nbsp; “My lord,” Catelyn said, “there was a small sept in the last village we passed. If you will not permit me to depart for Riverrun, grant me leave to go there and pray.”\u0026nbsp; “As you will. Ser Robar, give Lady Stark safe escort to this sept... but see that she returns to us by dawn.”\u0026nbsp; “You might do well to pray yourself,” Catelyn added.\u0026nbsp; “For victory?”\u0026nbsp; “For wisdom.”\u0026nbsp; Renly laughed. “Loras, stay and help me pray. It’s been so long I’ve quite forgotten how. As to the rest of you, I want every man in place by first light, armed, armored, and horsed. We shall give Stannis a dawn he will not soon forget.”\u0026nbsp; Dusk was falling when Catelyn left the pavilion. Ser Robar Royce fell in beside her. She knew him slightly-one of Bronze Yohn’s sons, comely in a rough-hewn way, a tourney warrior of some renown. Renly had gifted him with a rainbow cloak and a suit of blood red armor, and named him one of his seven. “You are a long way from the Vale, ser,” she told him.\u0026nbsp; “And you far from Winterfell, my lady.”\u0026nbsp; “I know what brought me here, but why have you come? This is not your battle, no more than it is mine.”\u0026nbsp; “I made it my battle when I made Renly my king.”\u0026nbsp; “The Royces are bannermen to House Arryn.”\u0026nbsp; “My lord father owes Lady Lysa fealty, as does his heir. A second son must find glory where he can.” Ser Robar shrugged. “A man grows weary of tourneys.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He could not be older than one-and-twenty, Catelyn thought, of an age with his king... but her king, her Robb, had more wisdom at fifteen than this youth had ever learned. Or so she prayed.\u0026nbsp; In Catelyn’s small corner of the camp, Shadd was slicing carrots into a kettle, Hal Mollen was dicing with three of his Winterfell men, and Lucas Blackwood sat sharpening his dagger. “Lady Stark,” Lucas said when he saw her, “Mollen says it is to be battle at dawn.”\u0026nbsp; “Hal has the truth of it,” she answered. And a loose tongue as well, it would seem.\u0026nbsp; “Do we fight or flee?”\u0026nbsp; “We pray, Lucas,” she answered him. “We pray.” \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45545.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:59:32 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:59:32 AM"}
