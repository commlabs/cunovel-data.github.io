You bolted into the bathroom and...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dips her head, and as we pass a streetlight, I catch the red invading her cheeks. “Sorry about that. I did forget my bracelets and I did drop them, but it was weird, you know, meeting someone at 1:00 a.m.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Weirder than that? She was there at one in the morning and I hadn’t slept with her. I shove my hands into my jeans pockets and silently curse myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at Rachel, and she quickly averts her eyes when I spot her spying on me. What the fuck does she see when she looks at me? If she saw what was inside, she’d be screaming. The outside is modest projection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel can’t like me because she doesn’t know me. The real me. For Rachel, life is still sunshine, rainbows and pink fucking fuzzy unicorns. I’m nothing but darkness, clouds and rats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should never have kissed her or brought her home. She deserves better than the brokenness inside me. I’ll hold on to tonight. Burn the memory of the way she’s looked at me into my mind because that’s as close as I’ll ever get to something like this again. Besides, if she saw me in daylight, away from the filth that I live in, she’d change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Beth did the moment she left town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaster than I would have preferred, we reach the parking lot of the auto shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about your car?” she asks as I enter the security code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motor whines as the garage door lifts. “I’ll head over and fix the tire now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want help? I’m pretty crafty with a jack and a tire iron.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to tell her no and stop when I see her face. I swear, she glows. Her eyes shine like stars, and her smile radiates with a light all its own. My throat swells. I don’t want to give her up. “No. I don’t want you getting into trouble at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See, you are bossy.” She finally takes her hands out of her pockets and nudges my biceps with one delicate finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stutters with her caress, and as she drops her arm, I quickly reach out and snake my fingers through hers. So close to letting her go, I shouldn’t touch her, but in my defense, she touched me first. “Not bossy. Concerned. Truth, Rachel, I want to know if you feel safe going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine. Ethan would have texted me if there were problems. Mom and Dad probably haven’t even come home for the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. I knew all about guardians who stayed out late to party. I guess having money changes nothing in the realm of shitty parenting. “Tell me your brothers protect you.” Because if not, I’d have to meet them in a dark alley sometime and school them on how to treat their sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like they’re overprotective.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI savor the feel of the smooth skin of her hand. No girl I have ever touched has had hands this soft. “That’s not a bad thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel releases a frustrated sigh. “You know, I’m starting to think I misjudged you. You sound annoyingly like my brothers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s right on one thing: she has misjudged me, but not in the way she thinks. “Good. I’m all for overprotection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bossy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle, and the sound makes her smile. I’m going to miss that smile. Tell her it’s over, asshole. Tell her that you come from two different worlds and that it would never work. Tell her that kiss meant more to you than she could ever imagine. Tell her that you’ll dream about her and think about her, but that’s where it ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color drains from her face and her hand goes limp in mine. Did she figure out I’m bad news on her own? She heads for her car. “Do you have my keys?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fish them out of my pocket and toss them to her. With the click of a button, the car unlocks and she opens the passenger door. She keeps her back to me for a second then turns with a piece of paper in her hand. “Here’s my number. I almost forgot to give it to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow as I stare at the number. Tell her. Just fucking tell her. “Rachel...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll call, right?” And the small amount of hurt in her voice stabs my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI envelop Rachel in my arms and cup her head to my chest. She smells good. Like the ocean. Like her jacket. I try to memorize the feel of her body against mine: all soft and warm and curves. The paper in her hand crinkles as she links one arm, then another around my waist. Leaning into me, she lets out a contented sigh and I close my eyes with the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen seconds. I’ll keep her for ten more seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to keep her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she can see past what I am. We don’t have to be more. We can be friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can fix this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can make anything work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith bright eyes, she shoves the number into my hand. “Okay. I’ll talk to you soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, and without another word, Rachel slips into the driver’s seat, turns over the engine and glides her Mustang out of the auto shop. Grasping my lifeline to her, I watch as her red taillights fade into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, then groan as I inhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can recognize three girls by their scent. Tonight I learned that Rachel smells like the ocean. Beth reminded me of crushed roses. And this girl—wild honey. I may not see her, but she’s there. Every ounce of happiness flees with the realization that my life can’t be changed. “What do you want, Abby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow of a slim figure ghosts its way toward me from the side of the shop. “I hadn’t heard that you found a new plaything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross my arms over my chest. “I haven’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe steps into the streetlight, brushing her long, dark brown hair over the shoulder of her tightly fitted hoodie. “Why so testy, Isaiah? She seemed cute. Spunky. I like cute and spunky. I had a bunny like that once, one of those large fluffy ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t seem like the bunny type.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not.” Her dark eyes wickedly flash over me. “Hence the word once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?” I repeat, glancing at the nonexistent watch on my arm. “It’s late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby and I have a weird friendship, which is odd since Abby doesn’t do relationships. The sarcastic curve of her lips indicates that, in this moment, she’s temporarily placed our friendship on the back burner. “My, my. We are emotional tonight. But to answer your question, I was on my way to your apartment because we have business to take care of, and I decided to stall our plans when I saw cute and spunky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses, waiting for me to fill her in on Rachel. The only answer she receives is the buzzing from the overhead streetlight. “So does this mean you’re finally over Beth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Abby were acting as my friend, I might tell her. But life for Abby, especially here recently, is all about business. Even though she’s only on the verge of turning seventeen. “Cut to the chase.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are no fun,” she says as she reaches into the back pocket of her practically painted-on jeans and pulls out a wad of cash. “I saw Eric tonight. Well, I hid Eric tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat catches my attention. “You hate Eric.” And Eric hates her. Their “businesses” often collide on the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like the idea of Eric owing me a favor.” Figures. Abby is always working an angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s this have to do with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a five-year-old on a playground, Abby grabs on to the metal utility pole with her outstretched hand and walks in a slow circle. “We had time to kill so we chatted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You chatted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She sticks her tongue out at me. “I’m capable of conversation at times. You know, will U of K make it to the final four this year, will the original Guns N’ Roses ever get back together, will I graduate from high school, and what people we know in common. Guess who came up in our chat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug and fake an innocent expression. “Me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrunches her pixie face. “Smart guys make me so hot, but unfortunately, you do nothing for me. I’ve known you too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Abby,” I say with a bit of impatience. “Are we gonna wrap this up or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eric said he owed you, so I volunteered to play mule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was extremely generous of you.” My instincts flare. She wants something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it is. But that is beside the point because now, sir, you owe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head before she finishes talking. “Wrong. You volunteered to mule my money. I don’t owe you shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby laughs and my mouth dries out. Where the hell is she heading? “We didn’t only talk about you, silly. Eric had a lot to say about two college kids who tipped off the police in order to create chaos so they could pull a gun on Eric and jack him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus on keeping my expression from changing. Abby doesn’t give info because she likes to talk. She’s fishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much did he lose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five thousand dollars, and let me tell you, Eric is not happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sure he’s not. Jacked in his own territory and he lost money. I’m sure Eric is on the warpath. “So if Eric got jacked then why is he willing to pay me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know Eric—he doesn’t believe in banks or investing, which is a shame with the amount of money he brings in. One of these days someone’s going to shoot him in the head and find his secret cubbyhole full of cash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me wonders if Abby will be the one to do it. I let out a sigh. I took it too far. Abby’s all business with selling drugs, but she’s not a killer. At least not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby continues, “You saved some of his guys tonight by spotting the cops. He wanted to make sure he paid his debt to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that I don’t find you interesting, but give me my money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like you better when you’re around cars. You’re less tense then. Anyhow.” She rubs the wad of cash between her fingers. “I think I’m going to hold on to this cash as a reward for keeping my mouth shut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me my fucking money, Abby.” I’m tired of her games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, but you should know that Eric was not only interested in the whereabouts of those two college boys, but also in a particular blonde we both just saw leave. You looked cute together—you and the blonde. I’m sure Eric would pay royally to know you were up on the girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA roar fills my ears as every muscle tenses. No one is going anywhere near Rachel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE NEVER CALLED. I WAITED. And he still never called. What I have a hard time comprehending is why I grieve for something that obviously was never mine to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few tables away, my brothers laugh. Each of them holds a bottled beer. In order to hide our youngest brothers’ involvement in underage drinking, Gavin and Jack stand in front of West and Ethan. Cold air drifts into the bottom of the large white tent housing the hundreds of guests and chills my ankles. The overhead heaters keep me warm, but the alcohol keeps my brothers warmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA votive candle floats in a crystal bowl full of water and translucent rocks. My hand hovers over the single flickering flame. Every white-cloth-covered table contains one of these centerpieces. I’d bet I’m the only guest wondering how close I can place my hand to the flame before I get burned. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-13.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
