Every Luxen comes in threes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “But if it’s really her—and I’m pretty sure it’s her—what does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake sat on the arm of the recliner, turning the TV remote over and over above his hands…without touching it. “How close were Dawson and Bethany?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it hit me. It all seemed so clear. The walls tilted a little as panic punched a hole in my chest. “Oh my God, Dawson had healed Bethany. That’s what everyone thinks. That she got hurt somehow and he healed her. And he could’ve changed—mutated—her, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded. “Oh, man…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I bet Bethany is a nickname for Elizabeth and… And what did that girl look like—the one who told you about the DOD named Liz?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows rose. “She had brown hair, a little darker than yours. Kind of sharp features, but really pretty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all started to click together. “This is insane. How would the DOD have known about her? She and Dawson disappeared just a couple of days after whatever happened between them, unless…unless someone who suspected that Bethany had been healed told the DOD.” My stomach tumbled over as I pulled my hair back into a messy twist. “Who would do that? One of the Luxen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I wouldn’t put it past the DOD to have Luxen who are the eyes and ears for them,” he said, rubbing his brow. “Man, that sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuck didn’t even cover it. That meant someone close to the Blacks had most likely betrayed them in the worst way. Anger whipped through me. I turned just as the curtains billowed out as if a rush of air had entered the room. A small cyclone of books and magazines moved through the living room, spinning and spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa, simmer down, Storm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked and the cyclone fell apart. Sighing, I picked up the books and magazines now scattered around the room. My pulse thrummed in my ears as my mind raced through what I’d discovered. “If the DOD has Beth, then what did they do with Dawson? Do you think he’s still alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope sparked with that idea. If Dawson was alive, that would… It would be like my father still being alive. My life would change. Daemon’s and Dee’s lives would change for the better. They’d be a family again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake grasped my arm gently, turning me toward him. “I know what you’re thinking. How wonderful it would be for him to still be alive, but Katy, the DOD doesn’t want Dawson. They wanted Bethany. And they’d do anything to get control of mutated humans. If the DOD told his family he was dead…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you don’t know if they told the truth,” I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would they keep him alive, Katy? If that really is Liz—Beth—then they have what they want. Dawson would be dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe that. There was a chance he was alive, and there was no way I could live with myself without telling Daemon and Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katy, he can’t be alive. They are ruthless,” he persisted, and his grip tightened on my arm. “You do understand that, right?” He shook my arm. Hard. “Do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised by his doggedness, I lifted my chin. My eyes met his, and there was something wrong in his, a quality that was slightly off and scary, like when he’d smiled and threw the knife at my head. Ice trickled through my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I understand. It probably wasn’t even her.” I swallowed, forcing a smile. “Blake, can you let go of my arm? You’re hurting me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked and then seemed to realize he’d been squeezing my arm. He let go and choked out a laugh. “I’m sorry. I just don’t want you getting your hopes up and being let down. Or doing something crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, my hopes aren’t up.” Rubbing my arm, I backed up. “And what could I do, anyway? I’d never tell Daemon or Dee if I wasn’t sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, he smiled. “Good. Let’s start training.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, I dropped the subject and hoped Blake forgot about it. Our training consisted of freezing things, and as soon as he left, I rushed to grab my cell. It was near midnight, but I texted Daemon anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan u come over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited ten minutes before I texted him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is important!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother ten minutes went by, and I was starting to feel like I was one of those psychotic girlfriends who texted the crap out of guys until they responded. Damn him. Cursing, I sent him one more text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts abt Dawson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even a minute later, I felt the rush of warmth on my neck. Stomach tumbling and twisting, I answered the door. “Daemon…” My words died off and my eyes widened. I must’ve woken him up, because…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shirt. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be below thirty degrees outside, but he was standing in front of me in flannel pajama bottoms and nothing else but glorious, perfectly formed skin stretched taut over hard muscle. I hadn’t forgotten what he’d looked like shirtless, but my memory had not served him one bit of justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stepped inside, eyes wide and luminous. “What about Dawson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut the door, heart racing. What if telling him was a mistake? What if Dawson was dead? I’d just be screwing up Daemon’s life even more. Maybe I should’ve listened to Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat,” Daemon snapped, impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.” I moved past him, careful not to touch any of his exposed skin, and went into the living room. Popping in front of me, he planted his hands on his hips. I took a deep breath. “I saw Bethany today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s head jerked to the side and he blinked once, then twice. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dawson’s girl—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you said,” he interrupted me, dragging both hands through his tousled hair. For a moment I was a bit distracted by the way the muscles in his arms and shoulders rippled. Focus. “How can you be sure it was her, Kat? You’ve never seen her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve seen her missing person’s flyer. It’s a face I can’t forget.” I sat down, rubbing my hands over my knees. “It was her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy shit...” Daemon sat beside me on the couch, dropping his hands between his legs. “Where did you see her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the confusion lining his face and I wanted nothing more than to comfort him somehow. “At the post office after school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you waited until now to tell me?” Before I could answer, he laughed under his breath. “Because you were training with Bilbo Baggins and you had to wait until he left to talk to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSqueezing my knees, I jerked my chin. Daemon should’ve been the first person I went to. Being shocked by what I saw and the training sessions weren’t nearly as important or a good enough excuse. “I’m sorry, but I’m telling you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded curtly and returned to staring at the Christmas tree. It seemed like forever ago that we’d put it up. “Man, I don’t…I don’t even know what to say. Beth’s alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, pressing my lips together. “Daemon, I saw her with Brian Vaughn. She’s with the DOD. They’d pulled over on the side of the road and the car door had opened. That’s how I saw them. He was closing the door and he looked angry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon slowly twisted his head toward me, and our gazes locked. Time stretched. An array of emotions went through his eyes, turning them from a bright green to a dark, stormy color. I saw the moment he knew what I was getting at—the second that his entire world came crumbling down and was rebuilt within seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspecting that Dawson had healed Bethany, and then jumping to Dawson and Bethany disappearing because of the DOD rather than the Arum wasn’t a hard leap to make. Not after discovering that by healing me, Daemon had also changed me. Then you throw Blake into the mix, plus everything he’d told us about the DOD and their search for mutated humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot to his feet and within seconds, he was out of his human form and blinding me. His light flared a shade of red-white as he pinged across the room. Wind picked up, stirring the bulbs on the Christmas tree. She was with the DOD? His voice whispered to me, tight with fury. The DOD is responsible for this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Daemon’s voice in my head always took me a few seconds to get accustomed to, and out of habit I answered verbally. “I don’t know, Daemon, but that’s not the worst part of this. How would the DOD know what happened between Dawson and Bethany unless…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless someone told them? His light pulsed and a blast of heat filled the room. But Dawson didn’t even tell me he’d healed her or that anything happened. How would anyone know? Unless someone had seen them other than me, suspected what happened, and betrayed us…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, not even sure if he was looking at me or not. All I could see was his form, no features, no eyes. “That’s what I’ve been thinking. It had to be someone who knew, and that probably really limits the pool of suspects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral moments passed and the temperature in the room continued to rise. I need to know who betrayed us. Then I’ll make them wish they’d never landed on this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes wide, I stood and pushed up the sleeves of my sweater. Swallowing, I took a chance. Daemon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis light flickered. I hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore proof that our connection hadn’t gone anywhere. I know you’re hell-bent on revenge, but most importantly, what if Dawson is still alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon drifted over to me, and tiny beads of sweat broke out on my forehead. Then I don’t know if I should be happy or sad. He’d be alive, but where? The DOD has him, and if that’s the case, what kind of life has he had? For two years? His next words sounded choked, even within my mind. What have they been doing to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears filled my eyes, blurring his light. I’m sorry, Daemon. I’m really sorry. But if he’s alive, then he’s alive. I reached out, placing my hand through the light, touching his chest. The light pulsed erratically then calmed. My fingers hummed. That’s got to mean something, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes it does. Then he stepped back, and a second later he was in his human form. “I need to find out if my brother is alive—and if he’s not…” He looked away, jaw working. “I need to know how and why he died. It’s obvious why they would want Beth, but my brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back down, wiping my palm over my forehead. “I don’t know—” Daemon grasped my hand so quickly, I gasped. “What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned my hand over, his brows furrowing. “What is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” I glanced down, and my heart stuttered. A deep, purplish bruise circled my wrist, right where Blake had grabbed me earlier. “It’s nothing,” I said quickly. “I banged my arm into the counter earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes lifted, piercing mine. “Are you sure that’s what happened, because I swear if it’s not, you tell me and that problem will be solved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced a laugh and an eye roll for extra benefit. There was no doubt in my mind that Daemon would do something terrible to Blake even though it was an accident. There were no shades of gray with him. “Yes, Daemon, that’s all that happened. Geez.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-34.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
