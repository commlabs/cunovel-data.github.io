They both got out and walked to Drew\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Where is Wright now?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I just checked with 702. He\u0027s in that apartment on Alameda.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The one he rented last week?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newly rented apartment was also a puzzle. Wright had apparently leased it on the spur of the moment. It seemed to coincide with nothing, except with the fact that one girl had been seen leaving his old apartment near the Cortez hotel three mornings in a row. This was unusual enough to suggest that Wright was going to set her up as his mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`702 talked to the doorman. Wright told the doorman they\u0027d be moving furniture into the apartment later in the day.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Hmmm.\u0027 That seemed totally unreasonable to Graves. Wright wouldn\u0027t spend time supervising domestic arrangements for a girl. It was beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping in the hallway, Lewis said, `Does all this make sense to you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No,\u0027 Graves said. `Not yet. But I expect to get some help.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout knocking he opened the door and entered Drew\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimothy Drew sat in an overstuffed chair and said, `I want to see my lawyer.\u0027 His voice was calm. The fact of his arrest, and the presence of two federal marshals standing by the doors with their hands resting on the butts of their revolvers, did not seem to disturb him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves\u0027 eyes swept the living-room. It was an expensive hotel suite, furnished in a heavily elegant style. Altogether, not bad for a man one year out of the Army. He sat down in a chair opposite Drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I want to see my lawyer,\u0027 Drew repeated. His eyes flicked once to Graves, then went back to the cops, as if he had decided Graves was unimportant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You\u0027ll have that opportunity,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew\u0027s eyes snapped back, fixed on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`In due time,\u0027 Graves added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I want to do it now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`We\u0027re in a hurry,\u0027 Graves said. His voice was not hurried at all. `We\u0027d prefer to have a statement from you now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I have nothing to say.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves shrugged, and lit a cigarette. He never took his eyes off Drew. This was going to be a kind of chess game, he knew, and it was a game he could win if he kept his temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I want to see my lawyer,\u0027 Drew repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves did not reply. He just stared. That was the simplest form of pressure, and he wanted to see if it would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Listen,\u0027 Drew said, `who are you guys, anyway? You haven\u0027t got the right to push me around. You haven\u0027t got a warrant -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Did you show him the warrant?\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yeah, we showed him the warrant,\u0027 one of the marshals said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Show him again.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marshal snapped open the warrant in front of Drew, then took it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Signed by a federal district court judge at nine thirty this morning,\u0027 Graves said. `All in order, all perfectly legal. You\u0027re arrested on a charge of conspiracy to steal classified information. It carries a mandatory twenty-year prison sentence if you\u0027re convicted. Parole is not granted for such charges. Do you know what that means?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I want to see my lawyer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027m trying to help you,\u0027 Graves said quietly. `Keep your mouth shut and listen: You were observed tampering with the computer terminals at Southern California Underwriters. You tapped into classified data banks at known times which coincide with your access to the terminals in question. We have traced back the lines. Furthermore, you utilized certain codes known to you but outdated. This gives you away. It\u0027s quite straightforward. You\u0027ll get out of prison when you\u0027re about fifty.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves stood up. `Now think carefully, Mr Drew. Is it worth it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew\u0027s face went blank, neutral, composed. `I want to see my lawyer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves sighed and walked around the living-room, looking idly at details. He glanced into the bedroom and saw a packed suitcase next to the bed.-He looked back at Drew. `Planning a trip?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I want to see my lawyer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves walked into the bedroom and opened the suitcase. The bottom half was filled with lightweight clothing, bathing trunks, sports clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top was packed with money, neat stacks of twenty-dollar bills held tight in paper sleeves. Fresh from the bank. He counted the stacks: it came to roughly twenty thousand dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a corner of the bedroom draped over a chair was a sports coat. He found a ticket for the noon plane to Acapulco in the pocket. A first-class ticket, one-way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the living-room. Drew watched him, wary now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Planning a trip, Mr Drew?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I want to see my lawyer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That\u0027s a lot of money in there, Mr Drew.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I have nothing to say.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`From your ticket, it looks like you were planning to stay down there. Not come back.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew shook his head. He did not speak. He was sweating, but still in control; he showed no sign of cracking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Can you account for all that money?P\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No comment. I want to see -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`All right,\u0027 Graves said. He sighed and turned to the marshals. `Okay, lock him up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marshals grabbed Drew roughly, each taking an arm. For the first time Drew became excited: `What\u0027s going on?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves found the reaction interesting. Was Drew afraid of jail? Was he homosexual? Did he need drugs? Graves decided to play on the jail fear. `We don\u0027t have many options, Mr Drew. I know it\u0027s not pleasant, but we\u0027ve got to put you in jail. You know, there\u0027s a lot of paperwork, and sometimes people get lost. Inadvertently deprived of their rights. I mean, people have spent a day or two in jail, and their papers get mixed up. So they don\u0027t get any food, or water, or anything. But you see, nobody knows you\u0027re there. For a while.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Where are you taking me?\u0027 Drew\u0027s voice was strained now, very tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Downtown. We\u0027ll be talking to you again in a day or so, when you\u0027re more... relaxed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Downtown San Diego?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yes,\u0027 Graves said. And he suddenly realized that Drew wasn\u0027t afraid of jail at all. He didn\u0027t want to stay in the city. That was what he was afraid of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You can\u0027t do that!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just watch it happen,\u0027 Graves said, lighting a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027ve got to leave,\u0027 Drew said. He was now openly agitated. `I have to leave. I have to leave.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It\u0027s my sister. She\u0027s sick, in Mexico. That\u0027s why I have the money, I need it \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You don\u0027t have a sister,\u0027 Graves said. `You have one brother two years older than you, who sells insurance in Portland, Oregon. Your father is still alive and lives in Michigan. Your mother died two years ago of a heart attack.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew\u0027s body sagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Put him down,\u0027 Graves said to the marshals. They dropped him back into the chair. `Now listen to me,\u0027 Graves said. `You aren\u0027t going anywhere without giving us some help.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew stared at him. `I want a cigarette.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves gave him one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What time is it now?\u0027 Drew asked dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Ten thirty.\u0027 Graves lit the cigarette for him and watched as Drew sat back and inhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Listen,\u0027 Drew said, `I have to catch that plane at noon.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Why is that?\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Drew said. `I swear to God I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What do you know?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I know I have to get out of San Diego today, because... something is going to happen.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`How do you know this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John told me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John Wright?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What did he say?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He said that the binary would go off today. In San Diego.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`And what is the binary?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t know.\u0027 He sucked on the cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Mr Drew, you\u0027re going to have to do better \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I swear to you, I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves paused. He let Drew sweat, and let him smoke. Finally he said, `How is the binary related to the information you tapped from the data banks?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I can\u0027t be sure. The information was in two areas. One was easy to get, the other was hard. First, John wanted supply routings. I spent a couple of days learning how to plug into the subroutines to release the information. I kept getting \"no authorization\" printouts, but finally I managed to plug in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`And extract what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Supply routings for different things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Things?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, John gave me the codes for what he wanted. Don\u0027t ask me where he got those codes. One of the codes was for a thing called \"Binary 75 slash 76\". I got a supply routing for that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`And you have no idea what the code represents?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`None. Except that it\u0027s obviously Defence Department material, transported by rail.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`How do you know that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`From the routings themselves. You can\u0027t be sure what\u0027s being transported, but you can tell the method - air, rail, other surface vehicle, truck convoy. You can tell the method.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What else can you tell?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You can tell the C and C ratings.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What\u0027s that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Command and Control provides a rating for all material transportation. The ratings are in grades: grades one through seven. One is pretty safe, or pretty inexpensive. Like clothing, or spare auto parts - that sort of thing. Seven is very expensive or very dangerous.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What was Binary 75 slash 76?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It was grade seven.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What did you think Binary 75 slash 76 represented?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew puffed on his cigarette. He did not answer for a long time. Finally he said, `I thought it was radioactive materials.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Meaning?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t know. Components for a bomb, maybe. I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves almost immediately rejected that explanation, although it fitted with the scintillation counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What else could it be?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You asked me what I thought it was.

But it\u0027s going to happen today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves sat back. Drew put out his cigarette. Graves offered him another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What does a code like \"binary\" mean?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It could be just a random code,\u0027 Drew said. `But they usually have some specific meaning.

Nuclear bombs are like that. You have two sections of uranium, neither of which will explode by itself. But you bring them together, and you reach critical mass, start a chain reaction.\u0027 He snapped his fingers. `Bingo.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now Graves was convinced that Drew believed this explanation. Graves did not. Whatever Wright planned, it had nothing to do with atomic bombs. That didn\u0027t fit with the tanks and hoses and nozzles, all of which pointed to some gas or liquid apparatus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He\u0027s insane,\u0027 Drew said suddenly. `That\u0027s the trouble. He\u0027s crazy. He\u0027s convinced that everybody is out to get him, and he\u0027s convinced that the government is being turned over to the wrong elements, and he\u0027s convinced that only he can set things right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You mentioned that there was something else you, had to tap from the data banks. What was it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That was strange,\u0027 Drew said. `I\u0027d already tapped the Defence routings. My job was over.

The ballroom was empty except for a girl sitting in a fold-up chair near one wall, and a marshal standing nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves went over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeen close, she was darkly tanned, conventionally pretty, and older than he had expected - in her late twenties or early thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Miss Lembeck?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh,\u0027 she said in surprise. `It\u0027s you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped him. Stopped him cold. `You recognize me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, just your face. I\u0027ve seen your picture.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Where?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John\u0027s apartment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I see.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Are you a friend of his?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Not exactly,\u0027 Graves said. `I work for the government.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Something to do with the Convention?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Not exactly.\u0027 He switched into a straightforward interrogation mode. `How long have you known Mr Wright, Miss Lembeck?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`About a month.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`How did you meet him?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Through friends.\u0027 She glanced from Graves to the marshal. `Have I done something wrong?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No, no. We just want to ask you some questions. What can you tell us about Mr Wright?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He\u0027s very nice,\u0027 she said. `We\u0027re engaged.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh?\u0027 That was a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yes. He bought me an apartment, just last week.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I see.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It\u0027s very nice. At least, it will be.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was not very bright, but she had a sweet sexiness that was unmistakable. Still, he couldn\u0027t imagine Wright marrying her. In the past he had married well-known women, celebrities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`There\u0027s nothing there now,\u0027 the girl said. `They\u0027re moving furniture in today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You must be excited.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh, I am. John\u0027s excited, too. But he has so much on his mind.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`How do you mean?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, business things. He\u0027s very interested in politics, you know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No, I didn\u0027t know that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You didn\u0027t?\u0027 she seemed puzzled. `I thought - well, anyway, he is. And this morning, we had the news on the television, and they announced that the President was coming into town. Well, he got very upset, and started making telephone calls. A lot of them.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-7.html","bookId":2408,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:58 AM"}
