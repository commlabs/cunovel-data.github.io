How about I put you on the defensive and question your every decision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a great plan without a follow-through. She couldn\u0027t think of anything to ask, and while Charlotte dug through her purse looking for only God knew what, Allison whispered to Liam, \"Could you put her on the defensive for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and tried not to laugh. He was fascinated by the way the sisters argued with each other. Their squabble was intense but never mean or angry, the way only two siblings who loved each other could fight. They were so comfortable with each other, there was no hint of hurt feelings. Despite their bickering, their deep affection and unbreakable bond were apparent. Oliver hurried back to the table, apologized profusely for having to take the call, and sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liam, you work for a computer company or the government?\" Oliver asked, trying to understand his relationship to Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Liam could answer, Charlotte blurted, \"Maybe Oliver and I should look over the contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison let out a frustrated sigh. \"Will you please let it go, you maniac?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam did laugh then. So did Oliver. \"Liam works for the FBI,\" Allison said. \"Want to discuss that, Charlotte, or do you want to continue to obsess about the contract?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte put her hands up. \"Okay, I\u0027ll stop nagging you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison couldn\u0027t have been happier. She reached for her drink and saw that it was empty. She held the glass up. \"Did I . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam nodded. \"You didn\u0027t swallow the ice this time,\" he said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver stopped his wife from continuing to grill Liam when he said, \"Sweetheart, why don\u0027t you share your news with Allison now before dinner? That way she can think about it, and if she has any questions, there\u0027s still time to discuss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte nodded. \"I guess I should probably fill Liam in, since he\u0027s here and he\u0027s apparently Allison\u0027s boyfriend . . . which I might add, she didn\u0027t tell us about. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God, will you stop?\" Allison demanded. She glanced over at Liam, who offered no denial. Instead he sat calmly smiling at her sister without comment, and she wondered what was going through his head. Probably wondering if lunacy ran in her family, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Allison, Charlotte turned to Liam and said, \"Our father took out a five-hundred-thousand-dollar life insurance policy, and Allison and I were the beneficiaries. When he and our mother died, our aunt Jane and uncle Russell found out about the money and crawled out of the woodwork like roaches and petitioned the court to become our guardians. The judge agreed but with stipulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What stipulations?\" Allison asked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once a year they were required to list the expenses and the money they spent on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They only sent in one report,\" Oliver interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it was bogus,\" Charlotte added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\" Allison asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had a huge expense listed for tuition at Vuillard Academy. It\u0027s the most expensive school in Boston,\" Oliver explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t go to Vuillard Academy,\" Charlotte told Liam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must have asked around and found the highest tuition,\" Oliver said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no one checked? No one looked. . . .\" Allison stopped. It was silly to get upset about something that was far in the past, she thought. Why waste the energy? \"That happened years ago. You can\u0027t do anything about it now. Besides, the money\u0027s all gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that,\" Charlotte said. \"But Oliver still wanted to look into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe no one noticed they weren\u0027t sending in reports,\" Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slipped through the cracks,\" Oliver said. \"I talked to a sympathetic clerk who found the file. That in itself is remarkable, and when he showed it to me, I told him neither of you went to Vuillard Academy. I hope you don\u0027t mind, Allison, but I also told him a little of what your life was like living with those people. I said that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison interrupted. In a rush, she blurted, \"You don\u0027t need to tell me what you said.\" She didn\u0027t want Liam to hear any of the horror from her childhood. He already knew quite enough. She thought about apologizing to him for making him sit through this, then changed her mind. He could always have gotten up and left.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-66.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
