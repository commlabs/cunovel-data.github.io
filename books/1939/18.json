{"id":66236,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eAt noon I found a message from my brother-in-law and returned Ritchie\u0027s call while I ate lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me,\" I said when he answered the phone. \"You called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I wanted to give you the details for Max\u0027s party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\" I reached for a pen and a pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saturday at eleven. Steph\u0027s taking Max and five of his friends to the arcade and out for pizza afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we expected to tag along?\" I asked, grinning, knowing Ritchie was a kid at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you don\u0027t want to accompany me and six highly active screaming boys to the arcade, where they\u0027ll go through quarters faster than a slot machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t miss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make a point of arriving early this Saturday,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen that radar of Ritchie\u0027s seemed to kick in. \"Anything new with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean new?\" I asked, stalling for time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With you and that oncology nurse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, then decided I\u0027d tell him about meeting Leanne. \"I went to dinner with her last night.\" \"Dinner? You actually asked her out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d that go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" I didn\u0027t elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt more than heard Ritchie\u0027s uncertainty. \"Define good.\" I should\u0027ve realized he wouldn\u0027t be satisfied with a oneword response. \"Okay, if you must know, we spent three hours together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie released a sharp whistle. \"Sounds like the two of you hit it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t convinced I should be discussing this with my brother-in-law. Sure as anything, on Wednesday when we met at the gym he\u0027d besiege me with questions. Questions I had no intention of answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leanne and I have a lot in common,\" was all I was willing to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a great start,\" he said enthusiastically. \"You\u0027ve met with Winter and now with Leanne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, he was keeping tabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of the two of them, who has the strongest appeal?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leanne,\" I said. \"Not that I don\u0027t like Winter,\" I added quickly, remembering they were cousins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of the third woman again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy Roth.\" I had no connection with her at all, no way of casually running into her as I had with Leanne. And it wasn\u0027t as if I could stop by her restaurant for coffee and a croissant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Practically nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wait. She\u0027s the model.\" Ritchie wasn\u0027t giving up. \"What else did Hannah say about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember.\" A lie. In her letter Hannah had mentioned the fact that Macy held several jobs. She\u0027d also written that she thought Macy would make me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to call her?\" Ritchie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy? I wouldn\u0027t even know how to get in touch with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, buddy, you\u0027re smarter than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t interested in meeting the third woman on Hannah\u0027s list. I liked Winter, but I had more of a connection with Leanne. Adding a third woman to the mix would confuse me, especially if I felt any kind of affinity with her, the way I did with Leanne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah wanted you to meet her,\" Ritchie pointed out--as if I\u0027d forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll let Hannah arrange it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what? She just might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle that,\" I said, not altogether sure I could. I looked down at my lunch of broccoli soup and a hard roll. I realized I\u0027d spent most of my break talking to Ritchie. \"I\u0027ve got to run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you.\" With that I disconnected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered why Hannah had chosen three candidates. Why not two? Or four? Maybe because three\u0027s a magic number, the number that always appears in fairy tales. If I was going to complete all my tasks like a fairy-tale hero, I had to meet this third woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I muttered, sensing her dissatisfaction with me. If not hers, then Ritchie\u0027s. \"I\u0027ll meet Macy. Somehow.\" I wasn\u0027t happy about it. I was astonished by how susceptible I was to guilt. And both Hannah and Ritchie were piling it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d finished my lunch, Linda came by, all smiles. She tended to be a sober woman and her amusement caught my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked her about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Dr. O\u0027Malley\u0027s office?\" Linda asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not recently.\" I saw Patrick two or three times a week but rarely visited his office at the opposite end of the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a mural painted for the children. It covers the entire hallway, both sides. It\u0027s the cutest scene with fire trucks and bulldozers on one side for the boys, and on the other is a castle with a coach and horse-drawn carriage for the girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mural,\" I repeated slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking this is something we might want to consider, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had done it again. She\u0027d given me the perfect excuse to contact Macy Roth. In her letter she\u0027d mentioned that one of Macy\u0027s many professions was that of artist. She painted murals. Therefore I\u0027d hire her to paint the office wall; that would allow me to meet her without any expectations. Well, other than for the job I was hiring her to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mural\u0027s an excellent idea,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to ask Susan in Dr. O\u0027Malley\u0027s office for the artist\u0027s name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...ah, sure. But I already know the name of a woman who could do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get the phone number of the one who painted Dr. O\u0027Malley\u0027s mural, as well,\" Linda told me. \"Then if the artist you know doesn\u0027t work out, we\u0027ll have another option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" This was what I appreciated most about Linda. She thought of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until the end of the day to call Macy. I found her phone listing in the online directory and punched out the number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang four times and I was preparing to leave a message when a breathless voice greeted me. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy Roth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me.\" She sounded as if she\u0027d run a long distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Dr. Michael Everett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it about Harvey?\" she demanded, panic in her voice. \"I asked him to give my name as an emergency contact. He\u0027s terribly ill, isn\u0027t he? I\u0027ve been so worried! He didn\u0027t tell me he made a doctor\u0027s appointment, but there\u0027s a lot Harvey doesn\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to wait for her to take a breath. As soon as she did, I jumped in and assured her this had nothing to do with Harvey, whoever that might be. \"Actually, I\u0027m phoning on an entirely different matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went quiet. \"This isn\u0027t about Harvey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I told her again. \"This is about a job. I understand you paint murals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" she said brightly. \"I\u0027m good at it, too.\" And modest about her talent, I noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to paint a wall for you? I charge reasonable rates and I\u0027m creative and dependable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose to ignore the finer qualities she felt obliged to enumerate. \"I\u0027m thinking of having a mural painted in my office.\" I wasn\u0027t willing to commit myself until I\u0027d had an opportunity to meet Macy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be happy to paint a mural for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have pictures of what you\u0027ve done?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do...somewhere. I\u0027m not sure exactly where they are, but I do have photographs of my work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I see them?\" It seemed a logical request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to hunt them up. I\u0027m afraid that might take a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman clearly didn\u0027t possess much of a business mind, let alone any organizational skills. \"Would you like to know what I want painted?\" I asked, half amused and half irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a wall, right? That\u0027s where most people want their murals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hallway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Have you chosen a subject? Like...like goldfish in a pond. Or a farm scene. Or--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to hear your ideas. When would it be convenient for you to stop by?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not doing anything right now,\" she volunteered. \"If you want, I could drop in tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be nice to deal with this matter after hours, rather than between patients. \"How soon can you be here?\" I asked after giving her the office address. \"Oh, you\u0027re close. I could make it in twenty minutes.\" \"I\u0027ll alert the security guard to let you into the building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" She hesitated, then asked, \"If I\u0027m a few minutes late, it\u0027s not a problem, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do my best,\" she promised and the line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few minutes late,\" as Macy called it, turned out to be thirty-five minutes past the time she\u0027d mentioned. I paced the office, disgruntled and annoyed. I insist on promptness, especially in business situations; when I tell someone I\u0027ll arrive in twenty minutes, I keep my word. If I\u0027m held up for some unforeseen reason, I contact the person in question and explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost an hour after our phone call, I heard the office door open and came out to meet Macy Roth. To my surprise, I did know her. When Leanne had apologized for not attending the funeral, I\u0027d said I hadn\u0027t been aware of who was there and who wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman in red. The woman who\u0027d worn a bright red outfit and a wide-brimmed hat with curls of carroty hair poking out beneath. She\u0027d stood out like a lone apple tree in the middle of a meadow. Everyone else had worn black or dark clothes for mourning. Not Macy. Just seeing her there as though dressed for a party had set my teeth on edge. Obviously the woman had no discretion. No common sense, either, since she\u0027d chosen to wear such cheerful clothes to a funeral. Today she had on a pair of yellow leggings, a leopard-print tunic and ballet-style shoes. Her long, red hair was pulled into a ponytail high on her head. Macy Roth must have been thirty, but in that get-up she looked about eighteen. She certainly didn\u0027t exhibit the professional appearance I would\u0027ve expected at an interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped abruptly when she saw me and her eyes met mine in sudden recognition. \"You\u0027re Hannah\u0027s husband,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy\u0027s eyes went soft with pain. \"I loved Hannah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said curtly. I wasn\u0027t going to discuss my wife with this woman I\u0027d disliked on sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember the time she--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re late.\" I knew I was being rude, but I couldn\u0027t help it. I was astonished that Hannah had seen this woman as a suitable wife for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped to attention like a raw recruit. \"Oh, yes. Sorry about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to get the shoe box down from the closet and then Lovie got trapped inside when I closed the door, except I didn\u0027t know that. All I could hear were these frantic cries. It took me five minutes to discover that she was still in the closet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea who Lovie was and could only assume she was either an animal or, God forbid, a toddler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found the photos you wanted to see. They were in the shoe box, the one in the closet. I have them in my purse.\" She fumbled with the zipper and chattered away nonstop. \"You see, Sammy wanted to be friends with Lovie, and Lovie wasn\u0027t interested. Normally Sammy\u0027s over at Harvey\u0027s place.\" She paused. \"I really am worried about Harvey. He just isn\u0027t himself lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mural?\" I said. \"For the hallway?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-18.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
