But, of course, you cannot help that.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Rabbit looked into the looking-glass pond and saw his little white blob of a tail. “Don’t you want to lend me yours, just this once?” he asked. “I would take great care of it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I cannot do that,” said the Chipmunk, “but I can lend you the tail of my late uncle. It is such a fine one that we have kept it to brush out the nest with.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The very thing!” said the Rabbit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So the Chipmunk brought the tail of his late uncle and tied it on to the Rabbit’s stub.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How does that look?” asked the Rabbit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [29]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fine!” said the Chipmunk. “Now tell me how I look!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well enough!” said the Rabbit. “Of course, you would look better if you had long ears.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dear me!” said the Chipmunk; and he, too, looked into the looking-glass pond. “Haven’t you a spare pair that you could lend me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, yes,” said the Rabbit. “There is a pair that belonged to my grandfather, hanging on the wall at home. I will get those.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cimg width\u003d\"413\" height\u003d\"186\" src\u003d\"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201609/21/11-05-11-51-1.jpg\" alt\u003d\"\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e So the Rabbit got the ears and tied them on to the Chipmunk’s head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How do I look now?” asked the Chipmunk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Splendid!” said the Rabbit. “Now let us go[30] and make our New Year’s calls. Where shall we go first?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wish to call on Miss Woodchuck!” said the Chipmunk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So do I,” said the Rabbit. “We will go there first.” And off they went.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They came to Miss Woodchuck’s door and knocked, and she opened the door. “Mercy!” she cried. “Who are you, and what do you want?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We are Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Chipmunk,” said the two friends, “and we have come to make you a New Year’s call.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “More likely you have come to steal the nuts!” said the lady angrily. “I know Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Chipmunk well, and neither of you is either of them. Who ever heard of a long-tailed rabbit or a long-eared squirrel? Get along with you! You are frights, and probably thieves as well.” And she shut the door in their faces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two friends walked a little way in[31] silence; then they stopped and looked at each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You said I looked fine!” said the Rabbit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I—I meant the tail!” said the Chipmunk. “It is a fine tail. But you said I looked splendid!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I was thinking of the ears!” said the Rabbit. “They are splendid ears.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They walked on until they came once more to the looking-glass pond. They looked at themselves; then they looked at each other; then, all in a minute, off came the long ears and tail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There!” cried the Chipmunk. “Now we look as we were meant to look; and I am bound to say, Rabbit, that it is much more becoming to you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So it is to you!” replied the Rabbit. “Now shall we call on Miss Woodchuck again?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come on!” said the Chipmunk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So they went to Miss Woodchuck’s house, and knocked once more at the door, and Miss Woodchuck opened it. “Oh!” she cried. “Mr. Chipmunk[32] and Mr. Rabbit, how do you do? I am so glad to see you. A happy New Year to you both!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The same to you, Ma’am!” said the Rabbit and the Chipmunk.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1643/48570.html","bookId":655,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:41:03 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:41:03 AM"}
