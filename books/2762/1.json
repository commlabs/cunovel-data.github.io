The ruptured ear drum would be So. Worth. It.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut unfortunately, I’ll need my hearing for my senior year this year. And also unfortunately, I can tell by the bright red hue to my mother’s cheeks that she’s far from finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and stare out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd ponder my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I live in a bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fragile, beautiful, misleading bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone looking in might think that life within my shiny bubble is perfect. That I have the perfect parents, perfect home, a perfect life. But it is far from perfect and so am I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr just ask my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach word that Adrianna Giannis spits from her lips is like an ice pellet. She’s really pissed now, I can tell. But I don’t care because I’m pissed, too. My new nose ring isn’t hurting anyone. It’s just a little silver stud. It’s not like I got a tattoo on my face or my nipples pierced. I tell her that and her nostrils flare out a little and she cocks her head in a very dangerous way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a cautionary step back. My mother has never laid a hand on me, but all good things must come to an end sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat time might seriously be now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom narrows her eyes and I might be mistaken, but I think I see red in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia Alexandria Giannis. We have put up with your black clothing and the way you dye your hair. We have even tolerated your new bad attitude. But this.” And at this point, she throws up her hands and waves them around. “This is ridiculous. You know that we have an image to protect because of your father. You know that. Yet you don’t seem to care. You don’t care about anything but yourself. What are we going to do with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare back at her as firmly as I can and take a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then reluctantly dive back into the same-old, same-old argument that we’ve already had five hundred other times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake that five-thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr five-hundred-thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom. I don’t understand why I have to pretend to be someone that I’m not just because of my father’s job. It’s not like he’s the prime minister. He just works for the prime minister. People don’t care if the MoD’s daughter dresses in black or has a nose ring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, they do,” she insists. “They notice and then your father has to field their questions. The Minister of Defense is a very important position to hold and people watch him. And when they see you acting like this, it’s embarrassing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze and my eyes meet hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiery green gaze meets fiery green gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, I’m an embarrassment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother freezes too and for a moment, I see uncertainty in her eyes, a hesitant waver. But then she steels herself again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why wouldn’t you be?” she demands harshly, all traces of the momentary softness gone. “You do everything you can possibly think of to embarrass us. And you do it on purpose. I don’t know why you sound surprised. Yes, right now, you embarrass us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am quiet and still as I assess this. I never meant to embarrass them and it is a strange revelation. All I have ever wanted was to be left alone, left to dress how I want and act how I want. Is that really so much to ask?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it hits me like a brick wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not going to win this argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am suddenly overwhelmed by frustration and anger and a little hurt, too. So I swallow hard, then swallow again. Then I walk right past my mother without saying a word. As I walk through my bedroom door, I grip the heavy wooden edge in my fingers and slam it as hard as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am satisfied with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI calmly stroll down the hall leading away from my bedroom, ignoring the shocked expression on a nearby maid’s face. Yes, we have maids. And butlers. And pool boys. No, I don’t like it. But apparently, my opinion is about as important as Monopoly money is in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother comes barreling out of my room, just like I knew she would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she had guns, they would be blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you think you’re going? We do not slam doors in this house, young lady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just did. But I don’t say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am silent and mulish and I keep walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom tags along at my heels like a rat terrier, but I still keep walking. She grabs at my elbow and I shake her off. She falls behind and stays there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just wait until your father comes home!” she calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to laugh at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be a terrifying threat, if in fact, my father comes home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he seldom does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep walking. I know that I’m being a spoiled bitch, but I can’t see past my own annoyance at this point. This need of my mother’s to force me into a perfect mold without any concern for my own wishes has come to a boiling point. I can’t take it anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe kill somebody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I won’t look good in an orange jumpsuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr actually, I probably would. I do look lovely in orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that’s beside the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb into my little red Mercedes convertible and jab at the button that slides the top down. There’s nothing like the wind in my hair as I speed too quickly along Caberra’s scenic highways. And I always, always speed too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift into first, then squeal my tires as I tear out of our curved semi-circle driveway. Mom ought to like that. She can just add it to her list of things that she’s pissed off about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear her voice in my head right now. Stanyos Giannis’ daughter does not squeal her tires, young lady. You’re an embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I am embarrassed when I suddenly realize that hot tears are welling up in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it. I wipe at them quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that I let her get to me like this. This should not have escalated into the feud that it has become. It’s just a freaking nose stud. I can take it out and the hole will grow closed. It’s not the end of the world. My mother, my father and in fact, the entire world, can eff off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift into third, then fourth gear as I speed along the highway that leads to Valese, the capitol of Caberra. We live ten minutes outside of town, in a sleepy house where nothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for a few screaming matches between my mother and father and me. And that seems to be happening more and more lately. It’s probably mostly my fault, but I can’t bring myself to conform to their stupid rules. Why should I have to? I’m not hurting anyone. Their stupid rules are stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsinine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shoulder strap of my black tank top slips down and I yank it back up. I seriously wish that my best friend was here. But Reece went back to her home in Kansas for her senior year, taking another of my best friends, Dante Giliberti, with her. Dante’s father is my father’s boss, which makes Dante one of the few people in the world who knows exactly how I feel about these things. But he’s gone now- a half a world away and I miss them both like crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the urge to pick up my phone and text Reece that very message. But these curves are too killer to text while driving. And I’ve already texted her that little message about 200 times since she left a month ago. It didn’t change anything. They’re still there and I’m still here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can still feel my temper, right under the surface, boiling and hot. I’ve got to calm myself down. But I don’t have anyone to talk to. Reece was my only real friend, besides Dante and Gavin. And Gavin is away until tomorrow on a trip with his dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m on my own, like usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m pissed off at the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and maneuver my car through the busy streets of Valese. Before I can even think about it, I find myself driving toward the sea. My favorite place in the world. I love everything about it. The vastness, the saltiness, the beauty. I love the taste of it on my lips and the feel of the sea breeze in my hair. I love being here because I know that I will smell like the sea for hours after I leave. The water always seems to calm me down. So, before I even know it, I have parked my car and am standing with my toes in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not really sure how I got here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr why I am here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m happy that I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaberra is beautiful. I have to give it that. An island nation just a stone’s throw from Greece, it is gorgeous and tranquil and ancient. I wiggle my toes in the wet sand and enjoy how the cool water laps at my ankles. If it weren’t daylight, I might just strip off my clothes and go skinny-dipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven I won’t go that far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents would freaking kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I sit down and situate myself in the sand, keeping my toes in the water. I watch my black-glittery-toenail bob in and out of the current and I try to zone out, to forget my current angst with my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m succeeding, too. That is, until a cowboy hat walks into my periphery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cowboy hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Caberra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolyFreakingHell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop what I’m doing, the zoning out into a vegetative state, and stare. I can’t help myself. We don’t have cowboys in Caberra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut apparently, we do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA giant of a man, or a boy, or a man-boy, is striding over the rolling sand dunes of the beach wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. That is striking enough in its own right. But the muscles on this guy, the guns. His biceps look as thick as my thighs. Which, as a thigh, isn’t that big. But as an arm! It’s enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulp, then stare at him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s got sandy-blonde hair peeking from under his hat and what looks like dark brown eyes. He’s wearing a button-up blue and white checked cowboy shirt with the arms ripped off and Levi’s that look like they were created just for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s like a handsome alien creature here in Caberra, where the average guy wears board shorts and flip-flops and carries a surf board like it’s an accessory. And it intrigues me. He looks like the kind of guy who is no stranger to hard labor and I bet a dollar to doughnuts that he’s got calluses on his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart flutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I imagine myself reaching in, wrapping my hands around it and squashing it like a bug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause a girl like me doesn’t get all fluttery over a boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even the tough, good-looking ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he is that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hasn’t noticed me yet. I don’t know why, unless the brim of his cowboy hat impairs his vision. Although to be fair, he is momentarily distracted by a horseshoe crab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch with interest as he kneels beside it and examines it, his face only a foot or so from the little beast. He acts like he’s never seen one before as he reaches out a finger and tentatively pokes it. It lies still and I wonder briefly if it is dead and has been washed in by the current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pokes at it again, probably wondering the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the thing lurches into life, scuttling in a haphazard direction directly at man-boy. Man-boy jumps backward in surprise, landing directly on his chiseled backside in the wet sand. The crab continues scuttling toward him, probably disoriented, and man-boy continues to scramble backward, kicking at the crab. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mia-s-heart/page-1.html","bookId":2762,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:21 PM"}
