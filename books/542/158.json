Here is one of them: \"When a man is passionately fond of women, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares bud little, who is homely, cross, d gitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the code, and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife control the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then his wife busies herself, grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education of half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers, presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law, follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself the sovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fast and annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arran`Ds, disarranges, hoards, lavishaa; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight, and that consoles her. While her husband disdains her, she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband.\" This theory M. Gillenormand had himself applied, and it had become his history. His wife--the second one--had administered his fortune in such a manner that, one fine day, when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained to him just sufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire with him. He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave a property behind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures, and, for instance, become national property; he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and he had no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. \"All that\u0027s the Rue Quincampois!\" he said. His house in the Rue Filles-du-Clavaire belonged to him, as we have already stated. He had two servants, \"a male and a female.\" When a servant entered his establishment, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province: Nimois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, foundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. \"How much wages do you want a month?\" asked M. Gillenormand. \"Thirty francs.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Olympie.\" \"You shall have fifty francs, and you shall be called Nicolette.\"\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e①摄政时期（1715-1723），法国王朝聘用苏格兰人劳氏（Law）管理财政，劳氏在法国建立银行网，使许多人破产。劳氏银行设在巴黎坎康波瓦街。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e②巴斯克（Basque），法国西南与西班牙交界一带的名称，巴荣纳（Bayonne）是该地一城市。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4295.html","bookId":542,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:56 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:56 AM"}
