I am sorry for disturbing you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing the door, Adem stood with his hand upon the wood. He did not look toward me, respecting my privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you call out your husband’s name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a nightmare. He was in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has hurt you,” Adem stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beyond the murder of your family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that is what you dreamed of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sobbed in disgrace, nodding my head though he could not see me. “I am sorry, Adem, for awakening you with ridiculous dreams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am just glad you are safe and unharmed,” Adem responded in a hushed voice. “I will go now.” He began to open the door, but hesitated. “I am sorry for whatever he has done to you and that I could not help you in that time of great need and despair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently, he exited my room, closing and locking the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobbing, I sat in my bed, listening to the distant choir as my heart cried out for Ignatius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 22, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDearest Countess Dracula,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have received the correspondence from your husband with instructions to set up a separate account in your name to enable you to begin the appropriate measures to restore his estate. I understand that he is consumed with his other dealings at this time and I will assist you in any way possible. Upon your return to Buda, I suggest we have a meeting in which I will lay out all the details of the Dracula Buda Estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am always at your disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Stephan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed down the letter and snorted with contempt. I could feel his disdain seeping from his words. He hated that he was to treat me as he would my dear husband. I flicked the letter with my fingers, sending it sailing across my desk. The Baroness\u0027 letter was no better. It was a desperate, sopping mess of false sentimentality, full of promises of her friendship and her declarations that she was my ever faithful servant. It was disgusting. But I was also comforted that they both believed that the correspondence I had faked from Vlad had been taken as genuine. These letters had arrived by regular post, not by Astir’s special courier. I wondered why Astir did not feel the need to swiftly deliver the mail from Vlad’s minions to me, but then it is always best to not think too much about Astir. He makes my head hurt with his vagaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, I pulled out my pen and paper, and settled down to write my responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJournal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 25, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Krone Hotel, Bistriţa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem and I continue to search for Erzsébet. I despair that she is lost to me, but he will not let me give up all hope. We have sought out and searched every graveyard we can uncover in these mountains. Our excursions on our mysterious black horses are always exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough our quests inevitably end in the failure to uncover my lost sister, I have come to enjoy the moments that follow when we cease our search and Adem trains me to fight. He has been immensely patient with me in every regard. I am well aware that I am quite difficult at times, but I have been trying to obey his instructions. We have started with knife training, though I rather fancied the idea of carrying about a sword. He has even had special sheaths delivered that I can tuck into my clothes. The weapons are silver with ornate gold hilts, therefore a formidable weapon against the ghouls and other vampires. I am already fond of the weapons and admire how they look tucked into my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often find a meadow to battle in, allowing the horses to graze under the night sky as we stand in the darkened world, our blades glinting while Adem instructs me with great patience. We move at a languid pace as he teaches me to anticipate my opponent’s movements and react accordingly. I often think we appear as slowly moving statues as we swing our blades around in a battle that is as indolent as a tortoise...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“...shift your weight to your other hip,” Adem ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouting, I complied, hearing my hem tear. “I am standing on my petticoat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you will be in battle. Do you think a vampire hunter, a vampire, a ghoul, or any other opponent will stand still while you fuss with your dress?” He raised his heavy eyebrows, his expression one of amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dagger clanked against his as I leisurely moved to defend myself against his sweeping blow. “No, but I like this petticoat and this is my only other riding habit after those horrible ghouls ruined the other one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a graceful, yet horribly idle motion, Adem advanced to knock me off balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready standing on my dress, I strove to counter, only to fall into the dew-slick tall grass. “Ugh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot allowing me to sulk at my disaster, Adem continued his attack, bringing the dagger down toward my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling on my elbows, I raised one leg and shoved my foot into his stomach, kicking. My movement was executed with my normal strength and speed. He flew, crashing into the horses. They nipped at him, whinnying, sounding as if they were laughing at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a very good move, Countess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m muddy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaped to my feet and quickly brushed off my clothes. His next attack was unexpected and swift. I barely had time to react. I managed to force my forearm up and under his thrusting arm, wrenching it to the side, pulling his blade away from my body. With my other hand, I gripped his throat, squeezing lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a burst of laughter, Adem relented. “Well, done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I am learning after all,” I said, experiencing a twinge of pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do believe you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I do confess my skirts are a disadvantage,” I murmured, gazing down at my torn hem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps we could have a good seamstress create a way for you to pull them up quickly without pausing in battle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps little drawstrings?” I considered this notion, pursing my lips. “Yes. I like the sound of that. I do wish Magda was here. She would help me. Katya can barely mend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, Adem lowered himself to recline on the grass. “Katya is completely enamored with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She would be enamored by any vampire. Vlad has twisted her and darkened her soul,” I responded with a frown. My clothing was already mussed and dirty from our mock battle, so I sank to the ground beside Adem, grateful to take a moment to rest. I gazed at our surroundings, drinking in the rich beauty of the night. The darkened valley spread out before us with the Arges appearing as a silver serpent winding through the forest. TheCarpathian Mountains enclosed the valley like imposing sentinels and I could see the castle perched high above, illuminated by the full moon hovering low in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pang of loneliness swept over me. I felt the yearning for Vlad once more rise inside of me, the false love created in me by his blood, and I hated him. I thought of my vampire sisters and my throat tightened with the pain of their betrayal. I had lost not only my human family, but my vampire family as well. If not for Adem, I would be terribly alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is beautiful here,” Adem decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it is,” I conceded, my heart heavy, “but it is my hell.” My gaze strayed to the glittering ribbon of the Arges River. I remembered far too well how I had tried to plunge myself into its depths to escape Vlad Dracula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am sorry for the loss of your family. I miss mine very much and it has been centuries.” Adem’s brow furrowed over his dark eyes, the scars on his face appearing deeper and darker, almost as if they were fresh wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plucked at the grass with my fingers. “I miss my sister’s ridiculously delicate composition. I miss my father’s completely calm, rational mind. I miss my mother’s fiery temper and undying faith.” I felt tears well in my eyes, my vision distorting as I returned my gaze to the castle. “Strange. In life I considered myself closest to my father. He was my confidant, my fervent supporter, and constant defender. But in death, it’s my mother I think of most often.” I could not bring myself to confess that it was I who had taken her life when Vlad had trapped me in her prison cell, ravenous with hunger and desperate to feed. My mother had given herself willingly to me. It had been a sacred act, her blood a sacrifice to give life to her daughter. I missed her and my heart stuttered as a tear fell down my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are they buried there?” Adem gestured toward the distant shape of the castle rising above the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I shook my head, miserable in my mourning. “I desire to bury them in Buda if possible. I wish I could return them to England, but...” I shrugged. “Their bodies are secured in a chest in the hotel’s storage. The gypsies gave me their bodies when I left the castle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vlad allowed you to do this?” Adem tilted his head, his eyebrow arched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my bottom lip. I wanted dreadfully to confess to Adem all that had happened, but I did not dare. I was certain that I should keep my terrible act against Vlad a secret. Vlad had never instructed me in the ways of vampire society and Adem had a distinct advantage over me in that regard. I could not be certain that what I had perpetrated against Vlad was acceptable. I suspected it was not. Additionally, I was a wife, a bride, a woman. I could not believe that vampires would be any more lenient toward my sex than humans were toward women. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-8.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
