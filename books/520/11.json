We\u0027ve forgotten we\n\u003cbr\u003e ever had a vacation. Fifty-seven irregular verbs have I introduced\n\u003cbr\u003e to my brain in the past four days--I\u0027m only hoping they\u0027ll stay\n\u003cbr\u003e till after examinations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some of the girls sell their text-books when they\u0027re through with them,\n\u003cbr\u003e but I intend to keep mine. Then after I\u0027ve graduated I shall have\n\u003cbr\u003e my whole education in a row in the bookcase, and when I need to use\n\u003cbr\u003e any detail, I can turn to it without the slightest hesitation. \n\u003cbr\u003e So much easier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call,\n\u003cbr\u003e and stayed a solid hour. She got started on the subject of family,\n\u003cbr\u003e and I COULDN\u0027T switch her off. She wanted to know what my\n\u003cbr\u003e mother\u0027s maiden name was--did you ever hear such an impertinent\n\u003cbr\u003e question to ask of a person from a foundling asylum? I didn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e have the courage to say I didn\u0027t know, so I just miserably plumped\n\u003cbr\u003e on the first name I could think of, and that was Montgomery. \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she wanted to know whether I belonged to the Massachusetts\n\u003cbr\u003e Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her mother was a Rutherford. The family came over in the ark,\n\u003cbr\u003e and were connected by marriage with Henry the VIII. On her father\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e side they date back further than Adam. On the topmost branches\n\u003cbr\u003e of her family tree there\u0027s a superior breed of monkeys with very\n\u003cbr\u003e fine silky hair and extra long tails.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining letter tonight,\n\u003cbr\u003e but I\u0027m too sleepy--and scared. The Freshman\u0027s lot is not a happy one.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours, about to be examined,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Abbott\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59733.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
