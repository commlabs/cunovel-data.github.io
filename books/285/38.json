I ought to be. You have done yourself the greatest credit.

The main thing was to succeed, and you have succeeded.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am glad to hear you speak so,\" said Luke, relieved. \"To me it seemed a great deal of money. You gave me two hundred dollars, and I have less than five dollars left. Here it is!\" and Luke drew the sum from his pocket, and tendered it to the merchant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t take it,\" said Mr. Armstrong. \"You don\u0027t owe me any money. It is I who am owing you. Take this on account,\" and he drew a roll of bills from his pocketbook and handed it to Luke. \"Here are a hundred dollars on account,\" he continued.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is too much, Mr. Armstrong,\" said Luke, quite overwhelmed with the magnitude of the gift.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let me be the judge of that,\" said Mr. Armstrong kindly. \"There is only one thing, Luke, that I should have liked to have you do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is that, sir?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like to have had you bring me a list of the numbers certified to by Mr. Harding.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Luke\u0027s answer was to draw from the inside pocket of his vest a paper signed by the old bookkeeper, containing a list of the numbers, regularly subscribed and certified to.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is that what you wished, sir?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are a wonderful boy,\" said the merchant admiringly. \"Was this your idea, or Mr. Harding\u0027s?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe I suggested it to him,\" said Luke modestly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That makes all clear sailing,\" said Mr. Armstrong. \"Here are fifty dollars more.

There was another cordial greeting, and Luke felt that it was pleasant, indeed, to have two such good friends.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When are you going to Groveton, Luke?\" asked Mr. Reed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall go this afternoon, if there is nothing more you wish me to do.

Your mother is your best friend, and deserves all the attention you can give her.

Both were satisfied that Prince Duncan, the president of the bank, was the real thief who had robbed the bank. There were two courses open—a criminal prosecution, or a private arrangement which should include the return of the stolen property. The latter course was determined upon, but should it prove ineffective, severer measures were to be resorted to.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3006/82999.html","bookId":285,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:44:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:44:31 AM"}
