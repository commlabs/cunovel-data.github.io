How\u0027s that gonna help us? We tried to take him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pretty sure I can persuade him to leave you alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty sure?\" Alex said. \"That\u0027s a real comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to start somewhere,\" Erik said. \"Rhys is the most powerful vampire I know. I don\u0027t want to fight him if I can help it. I\u0027d rather try to reason with him. If that doesn\u0027t work...\" He shrugged. \"Then it\u0027s the three of us against him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering under his breath, Alex paced the length of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy leaned toward Erik. \"Do you think the three of us can beat him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m betting my life on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Alex said glumly. \"And ours, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see that ad,\" Erik said, rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy led the way into her office and switched on the light. Alex sat at the computer, with Daisy and Erik standing behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him only a few moments for Alex to find the right listing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy grimaced as she read the ad, which was short and to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-hundred-thousand-dollar reward for the head of Rhys Costain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContact MC at hunterz666.net when the job is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to go out for a while,\" Erik said. \"Then I\u0027m going to get in touch with Rhys and see if he\u0027ll listen to reason. I\u0027m going to tell him what I think is going on. If he\u0027s willing to be reasonable, we\u0027ll see about setting that trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if he isn\u0027t willing to be reasonable?\" Daisy asked. \"What then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shook his head. \"Then it\u0027s a whole new ball of wax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you going out?\" Alex asked, suspicious as always. \"How do we know you\u0027re not going behind our backs to make a deal with Costain? You know, our lives for yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, enough! Erik saved my life. He saved your life. I won\u0027t have you talking to him like he\u0027s our enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, Daisy,\" Erik said. \"He has no reason to trust me, any more than I trust him. Like I said, I need to go out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy watched him leave the room, and then hurried after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik, wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned at the sound of her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you be back? What if Rhys comes here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, darlin\u0027.\" Erik put one finger under her chin. \"I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can. If Rhys comes here, don\u0027t talk to him. Don\u0027t open the door. Don\u0027t ask him inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her eyes wide. \"What if you don\u0027t come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik\u0027s gaze moved over her face. \"If I don\u0027t come back, get the hell out of LA just as fast as you can.\" Forcing a smile, he kissed the tip of her nose. \"Don\u0027t worry, little flower, I\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stared after him. How could she let him go? What if she never saw him again? \"Erik!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused on the sidewalk. \"I\u0027ll never get back if you don\u0027t let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be. I won\u0027t let anything happen to you. Or that brother of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the distance between them. \"Daisy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her fingertips to his lips, silencing him, everything she was thinking, feeling, shining in the depths of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" His gaze moved over her face, as if to memorize every line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Erik. I want this night to remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said tremulously. \"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he should refuse, tell her this wasn\u0027t the time, and definitely not the place, but if he were honest with himself, he was just as afraid as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to tell Alex you\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want him to spend the rest of the night worrying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my brave girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, Daisy went back into the house. She didn\u0027t feel brave, but Erik was right. She couldn\u0027t just leave without letting Alex know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found him in the living room, watching the news on TV. \"I\u0027m going out with Erik for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think that\u0027s a good idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not, but I\u0027m going, so don\u0027t try to stop me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose it would do me any good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love him, Alex. Please try to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand, and I never will. When will you be back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. Before sunrise, I guess,\" she said with a bittersweet smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your phone on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\" Impulsively, she threw her arms around him and hugged him tight. \"I love you, Alex. Thanks for always being there for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, go on, get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy held his gaze for a long moment, and then she ran out of the house. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d let you out of the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you sent me in there? Because you thought he\u0027d make me stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foolish girl,\" he said, and wrapping her in his embrace, he transported the two of them into the hills, far from the city, to a four-star hotel that catered to the very wealthy who wanted to get away from it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick stop in the office and a bit of vampire magic procured the best suite in the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy glanced around the room, her eyes wide as she took it all in. The walls and carpet were a pale, pale blue. Tall windows overlooked the twinkling lights of the city below. A cheery blaze sprang to life in the white marble fireplace when Erik closed the door. Soft music and lighting added to the seductive ambience as Erik took her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to try and talk me out of this, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He had wanted her too long, waited too long for this moment. He folded his hands over her shoulders and drew her into his embrace. She leaned into him, the soft curves of her body pressing against his as she lifted her face for his kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyelids fluttered down as his mouth covered hers. His lips were firm and cool, his tongue a flame as it dueled with hers in a mating dance that was as old as time and yet forever new. She clasped her hands behind his neck, wanting to be closer still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again and yet again, his mouth as hot and hungry as the hands that glided over her body, sending shivers of delight coursing through her. Lifting her into his arms, he carried her swiftly into the bedroom, his mouth never leaving hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid her on the bed, then followed her down, his hands again moving over her body, until she lay naked beside him. He shed his own clothing and then drew her up against him. She basked in the touch of his bare skin against her own, the heat of his mouth on hers. The stroke of his tongue was like lightning, igniting a fire deep within her very core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands drifted over her shoulders, her breasts, her thighs, each touch slow and sensual, teasing her senses. Clever hands that knew when and where to stroke, to softly caress, until she writhed beneath him, helpless, mindless, aware of nothing but the heat of his kisses, the warmth of his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clung to him, afraid that if she let go, she might float away. What magic had he wrought upon her senses? He was life itself, more vital to her existence than the air she breathed. How would she survive if he took his mouth from hers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he rose over her, she lifted her hips to receive him, a muffled cry of pain rising in her throat as his body melded with hers, but the discomfort was quickly forgotten as he moved inside her, each stroke of his flesh building the tension within her. She buried her face in his shoulder as, with a last thrust, he brought her to fulfillment. His own release came quickly, filling her with warmth and a sense of pleasure unlike anything she had ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik kissed her as he rolled onto his side, carrying her with him, so that they lay facing each other, their bodies still entwined. With a sigh, she wrapped her arms around him and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze moved over her face, noting the sweep of her lashes against her cheeks, the faint perspiration on her brow. Her breasts were warm against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been wrong of him to take her innocence. Had he known she was untouched, his honor would have forbidden him to take her. But he had wanted her for so long, needed her so badly, he hadn\u0027t taken the time to ask if she was still a virgin. And yet he should have known. Perhaps, deep down, he had known. But he couldn\u0027t be sorry for what he\u0027d done. A woman never forgot her first lover. Whatever happened in the future, she would always remember him, always remember this night, just as he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed a kiss across her cheek and then, still holding her in his embrace, he brushed the hair from her neck. A taste, he told himself. He would only take a taste. If things went wrong when he met with Rhys, he wanted to carry the memory of this night and the sweet taste of Daisy\u0027s blood with him when Rhys sent him to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after midnight when Erik tucked Daisy into her own bed and kissed her good night. Outside, he paused in the shadows. Gathering his power around him, he placed protective wards around her house just in case Rhys showed up. Erik was certain that the threshold of the O\u0027Donnells\u0027 house was strong enough to repel an angry vampire, but in Daisy\u0027s case, he wasn\u0027t willing to risk being wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was satisfied with the wards he had erected, he willed himself to his own home. Although going up against Rhys wasn\u0027t something he was looking forward to, it had to be done, but not before he had afforded himself a little extra added protection. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-41.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
