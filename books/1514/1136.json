Only those who held a high status in the tribe, were qualified to enter and train. However, over the years, the tribe had consistently lost contact with many peak experts who had went inside to enter a cultivation seclusion. Moreover, only after the tribe members combed the place, did they discover their remaining skeletons. This was likely because they had failed while they were trying to make a breakthrough.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was precisely because of this that ordinary tribe members were forbidden from entering the Heavenly Cave.

A deep and seemingly bottomless huge hole was present at the spot where the many mountains intersected. The huge hole was ten thousand feet in size.

Their eyes were shut, giving them the appearance of old monks in meditation. Only the ocean like, vast and mighty Yuan Power ripples around them, allowed one to glimpse the terrifying strength that they possessed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThey were the guardians of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe’s Heavenly Cave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWild gales whistled over the mountain forest and the entire area was devoid of life. Not only were members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe not allowed to enter this place, but even those completely harmless birds and animals were exterminated. In order to ensure that the people within the cave would have a perfect place for a cultivation seclusion, the Celestial Demon Marten tribe had clearly eliminated all possible threats.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, this silence did not continue for long. Suddenly, the sound of rushing wind appeared. A figure rushed over with lightning like speed. His vast and mighty aura caused the numerous figures near the Heavenly Cave to suddenly opened their eyes.

They held an extremely high status in the tribe and they had reached the Samsara stage. However, it was unexpected that Little Marten still managed to block their attacks despite the fact that the five of them had attacked together. Although this was in part because they did not use their full strength, Little Marten’s performance still caused them to secretly praise him in their hearts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, despite having praises for Little Marten, they did not hesitate when they attacked. The five of them moved and appeared in front of Little Marten. Then, they formed a formation, before vast and mighty Yuan Power surged and a light array directly enveloped Little Marten.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Boom boom boom!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLittle Marten had also unleashed his full fighting strength.

With this blood feather, he was finally able to detect an extremely obscure connection in that direction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“He should be in that direction.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong muttered to himself. He moved and directly flew in that direction. The Yuan Power within his body also began to circulate as he did so, forming a layer of defence over the surface of his body. This place was mysterious and unfathomable and it was best to be a little extra cautious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNo light was present amidst this darkness. The deathly silence caused fear to arise in one’s heart. However, Lin Dong remained calm. Back when he subdued the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, the darkness and loneliness in that place was several times greater than this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong travelled for an hour before he suddenly stopped. Suddenly, he looked towards his left. It was possible for him to detect a mysterious ripple from that direction. After which, he extended his hand and gently touched the dark space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBuzz!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe darkness fluctuated when Lin Dong’s hand touched it. After which, it was possible to see the darkness gradually becoming illusory. Behind the darkness, was a cave lit by a dim yellowish candlelight. Meanwhile, a figure was seated within the cave. From his appearance, it seems like he was a top expert from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere was nothing wrong with undertaking a cultivation seclusion in a cave. However, Lin Dong still felt as if something was amiss. As his eyes slowly swept across the cave, a moment later, he focused his attention on the mountain wall on the right of that person. At that spot, there was a octagon shaped black flower growing there. A scent, which an ordinary person had difficulties detecting, was vaguely drifting from it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Is that…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong frowned slightly. That black flower was not overtly mysterious, but Lin Dong could feel his two great Ancestral Symbols shaking slightly when he looked at that flower.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Eternal Illusion Demon Flower.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYan’s voice suddenly sounded.
