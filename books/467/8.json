I wonder what he has been doing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stealing, very likely,\" said Clarence, shrugging his shoulders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He doesn\u0027t look like a thief.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [68]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Appearances are deceitful,\" said Clarence, oracularly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the supper-table, where Clarence met his father for the first time since he had called at his office, he said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, papa, what do you think? That country boy I saw in your office has got into trouble.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you mean your cousin Benjamin?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose he is my cousin,\" said Clarence, reluctantly, \"but I don\u0027t care about knowing him for a relation. I saw him on Broadway in charge of a policeman.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you sure of this?\" said Mr. Walton, much surprised.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; I knew him well enough by his clothes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Clarence then gave an account of his meeting Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you speak to him?\" asked his father.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mercy, no! Percy Van Dyke was with me. I wouldn\u0027t for a hundred dollars have him know that I had a cousin arrested, and such a countryfied-looking cousin, too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think Benjamin would be a good-looking [69] boy if he were well dressed,\" said Mr. Walton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t,\" said Clarence, decidedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry to hear he has got into trouble,\" said Mr. Walton, who was not so mean as his son. \"I think I ought to do something to help him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Better leave him to his fate, pa. No doubt he is a bad boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t understand why he should be. My sister is poor but an excellent woman, and his father was an exemplary man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think we have any call to trouble ourselves about this boy,\" said Clarence. \"He has disgraced us, and we couldn\u0027t do anything without having it all come out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way, Clarence, I have two tickets to the Grand Opera House this evening; would you like to go?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just the thing, pa; I was wondering what we should do to pass the time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Edwin Booth is to appear as Cardinal Richelieu. It is one of his best characters. It will be a rare treat.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Percy Van Dyke is to be there with his [70] sister,\" said Clarence. \"That is the reason why he wouldn\u0027t take supper with me at Delmonico\u0027s this evening.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will have a chance to see your friends between the acts,\" said Mr. Walton. \"I am perfectly willing you should become intimate with the Van Dykes. By the way, bring your friend around and introduce him to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, pa.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Walton had been the architect of his own fortune, while the Van Dykes were descended from an old Dutch family, and had held for over a century a high social position. Now that the merchant had money, he thirsted for social recognitionâ€”something money will not always buy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Eight o\u0027clock found father and son in choice orchestra seats in the Grand Opera House, and they began to look about them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly Mr. Walton said, sharply:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What was all that rubbish you were telling me about your cousin being arrested?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was perfectly true, pa,\" answered Clarence, looking at his father in surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [71]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you say to that, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Following the direction of his father\u0027s finger, Clarence\u0027s eyes rested upon his despised country cousin, elegantly dressed, sitting two rows to the front, and a little to the right, with his eyes fixed upon the curtain, which was then rising.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That looks very much as if your cousin had been arrested!\" said his father, with a sneer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t understand it,\" ejaculated Clarence. \"It can\u0027t be my cousin. It must be some other boy that looks like him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then Ben chanced to turn round. Observing his uncle\u0027s eyes fixed upon him, he bowed politely and turned once more to the stage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80906.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
