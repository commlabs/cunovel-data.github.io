With nearly a year of their hitch on Space Station A5 behind them, they were understandably weary of filtration units that clanked, hydroponic tubs that leaked, air generators that hummed constantly and stopped occasionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing works,\" Woodbury would say mournfully, \"because everything is hand-assembled by ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Following directions,\" Hansen would add, \"composed by an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were undoubtedly grounds for complaint there. The most expensive thing about a spaceship was the room allowed for freight so all equipment had to be sent across space disassembled and nested. All equipment had to be assembled at the Station itself with clumsy hands, inadequate tools and with blurred and ambiguous direction sheets for guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainstakingly Woodbury had written complaints to which Hansen had added appropriate adjectives, and formal requests for relief of the situation had made their way back to Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Earth had responded. A special robot had been designed, with a positronic brain crammed with the knowledge of how to assemble properly any disassembled machine in existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat robot was in the crate being unloaded now and Woodbury was trembling as the airlock closed behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First,\" he said, \"it overhauls the Food-Assembler and adjusts the steak-attachment knob so we can get it rare instead of burnt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered the Station and attacked the crate with dainty touches of the demoleculizer rods in order to make sure that not a precious metal atom of their special assembly-robot was damaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crate fell open!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there within it were five hundred separate pieces-and one blurred and ambiguous direction sheet for assemblage. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-40.html","bookId":1734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM"}
