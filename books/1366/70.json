Are you the man whose scent is so keen for a blunder, and who is himself blunder-proof?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I think I may say so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. I suppose one must be blunder-proof, to detect the man who is not so?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Assuredly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Do I understand that you are proof?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. How could I call myself educated, if I made blunders at my age?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Well, shall you be able to detect a culprit, and convict him if he denies it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Of course I shall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Catch me out, then; I will make one just now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Say on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Why, the deed is done, and you have missed it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. You are joking, of course?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. No, upon my honour. The blunder is made, and you none the wiser. Well, try again; but you are not infallible on these sort of things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Well?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Again, the blunder made, and you unconscious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. How can that be, before you have opened your lips?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Oh yes, I opened them, and to a blunder; but you never see them. I quite doubt you seeing this one even.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Well, there is something very queer about it if I do not know a solecism when I hear it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. One begins to doubt, when a man has missed three.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Three? What do you mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. A complete triolet of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. You are certainly joking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. And you are as certainly a poor detective.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. If you were to say something, one might have a chance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Four chances you have had, and no result. It would have been a fine feather in your hat to have got them all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Nothing fine about it; it is no more than I undertook.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Why, there you are again!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Again?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. ‘Feather in your hat’!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I don’t know what you mean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Precisely; you do not know. And now suppose you go first; you do not like following, that is what it is; you understand, if you chose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Oh, I am willing enough; only you have not made any solecisms in the usual sense.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. How about that last? Now watch me well, as you did not get me that time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I cannot say I did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Now for a rabbit, then; there, that ’s him! Has he got by? There he is, that ’s him, I tell you. Hims enough to fill a warren, if you don’t wake up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Oh, I am wide awake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Well, they are gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Never!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. The fact is, your too much learning renders you unconscious to solecisms; whatever case I take, it is always the same.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. What you mean by that I am sure I don’t know; but I have often caught people out in blunders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Well, you will catch me about the time that you are a sucking child again. By the way, a babe laying in his cradle would hardly jar on your notions of grammar, if you have not yet got me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Well, I am convinced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Now, if we cannot detect blunders like these, we are not likely to know much about our own; you see, you have just missed another. Very well now, never again call yourself competent either to detect blunders or to avoid them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is my blunt way, you see. Socrates of Mopsus, with whom I was acquainted in Egypt, used to put his corrections more delicately, so as not to humiliate the offender. Here are some specimens:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What time do you set out on your travels? — What time? Oh, I see, you thought I started to-day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The patrimonial income supplies me well enough. — Patrimonial? But your father is not dead?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So-and-so is a tribes-man of mine. — Oh, you are a savage, are you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fellow is a boozy. — Oh, Boozy was his mother’s name, was it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Worser luck I never knew. — Well, you need not make it worserer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I always said he had a good ’eart. — Yes, quite an artist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So glad to see you, old cock! — Come, allow me humanity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Contemptuous fellow! I would not go near him. — If he were contemptible, it would not matter, I suppose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He is the most unique of friends. — Good; one likes degrees in uniqueness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How aggravating! — Indeed? what does it aggravate?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So I ascended up. — Ingenious man, doubling your speed like that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I had to do it; I was in an engagement. — Like Xenophon’s hoplites.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I got round him. — Comprehensive person.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They went to law, but were compounded. — You don’t say they didn’t get apart again?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He would apply the same delicate treatment to people unsound in their Attic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘That’s the truth of it,’ said some one, ‘between you and I.’ Ah no, you will have to admit that you and me are wrong there.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Another person giving a circumstantial account of a local legend said: ‘So when she mingled with Heracles —’ ‘Without Heracles’s mingling with her? ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He asked a man who told him that he must have a close crop, what his particular felony had been.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘There I quarrel,’ said his opponent in an argument. ‘it takes two to make a quarrel.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When some one described his sick servant as undergoing torture, he asked, ‘What for? what do they suppose they are going to get out of him?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some one was said to be going ahead in his studies. ‘Let me see,’ he said; ‘it is Plato, I think, who calls that making progress.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Will we have a fine day?’ ‘If God shall.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Archaist, curse not thy friend’ he retorted, to a man who called him curst instead of crusty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A man once used the phrase, ‘I was trying to save his face.’ But is he in any danger of losing it?’ asked Socrates.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Chided,’ said one man, ‘chode,’ another. He disclaimed all acquaintance with either form.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A person who volunteered ‘but and if’ was commended for his generosity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some one tried him with ‘y-pleased’; ‘no, no,’ said he; ‘that is too much of a good thing.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I expect him momently,’ some one announced. ‘A good phrase,’ he said; ‘so is “minutely”; we have excellent authority for “daily.\"’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Look you!’ said a man, meaning ‘look’ ‘Yes, what am I to look you at?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He took up a man who said, ‘Yes, I can grapple with that,’ meaning that he understood, with ‘Oh, you are going to throw me, are you? how?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘How shrill those fives are!’ said some one. ‘Oh, come now,’ said Socrates; ‘seditions and strives, but not drums and fives.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘That man is heavily weighed,’ one man observed. ‘You are quite right; there is no such word as weighted.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘He has thrived on it,’ some one assured him. ‘The people among whom he has thrived cannot be very particular.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e People were very fond of calling it at-one-ment. ‘Yes, all right,’ he would say; ‘I know what it means.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mention being made of a black-hen, he supposed that would be the female of the grey-cock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some one said he had been eating sparrowgrass. ‘You’ll be trying groundsel next,’ was his comment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But enough of Socrates. Shall we have another match on the old lines? I will give you nothing but first-rate ones. Have your eyes open. You will surely be able to do it now, after hearing such a list of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I am by no means so sure of that. Proceed, however.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Not sure? well, but here you have the door broad open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Say on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. I have said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Nothing that I observed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. What, not observed ‘broad open’?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Well, what is to happen, if you cannot follow now? Every man can crow on his own hay-cock, and I thought this was yours. Did you get that hay-cock? You don’t seem to attend; look at the mutual help Socrates and I have just given you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I am attending; but you are so sly with them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Monstrous sly, is it not, to say ‘mutual’ instead of ‘joint’? Well, that is settled up; but for your general ignorance, I defy any God short of Apollo to cure it. He gives council to all who ask it; but on you that council is thrown away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Yes, I declare, so it was!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Perhaps one at a time are too few?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I think that must be it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. How did ‘one are’ get past you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur Ah, I didn’t see it, again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. By the way, do you know of any one who is on the look in for a wife?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. What are you talking about?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Show me the man who is on the look in, and I will show you a solecist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. But what have I to do with solecists on the look in for wives?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Ah, if you knew that, you would be the man you pretend to be. So much for that. Now, if a man came to you and said that he had left his wife’s home, would you stand that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Of course I should, if he had provocation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. And if you caught him committing a solecism; would you stand it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Certainly not.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Quite right too. We should never permit solecisms in a friend, but teach him better. Now, what are your feelings when you hear a man deprecating his own merits, and depreciating his friend’s excessive gratitude?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Feelings? only that he shows a very proper feeling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Then, as you cannot feel the difference between ‘deprecate’ and ‘depreciate,’ shall we conclude that you are an ignoramus?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Outrageous insolence!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Outrageous? I shall be, ere much, if I go on talking to you. — Now I should have said that ’ere much’ was a blunder, but it does not strike you so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Oh, stop, for goodness’ sake! Look here, try this way; I want to get my profit out of it too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Well?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Suppose you were to go through all the blunders you say I have missed, and tell me what is the right thing for each.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Good gracious, no; it would take us till midnight. No; you can look those out for yourself. Meanwhile, we had better take fresh ones, as we have only a quarter of an hour (by the way, never pronounce the ‘h’ in hour; that sounds dreadful). Then as to that outrage which you say I have committed upon you; if I were to speak of an outrage committed against you, that would be another thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Would it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Yes; an outrage upon you must be committed upon you personally, in the shape of blows, interference with your liberty, or the like. An outrage against you is upon something that belongs to you; he who does an outrage upon your wife, child, friend, or slave, does it against you. This distinction, however, does not apply to inanimate things. An ‘outrage against’ is a legitimate phrase with them, as when Plato talks in the Symposium of an outrage against a proverb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Ah, I see now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Do you also see that the exchange of one for the other is a solecism?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Yes, I shall know that for the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. And if a person were to use ‘interchange’ there instead of ‘exchange,’ what would you take him to mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Just the same.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Why, how can they be equivalent? Exchange is merely the substitution of one expression for another, the improper for the proper; whereas interchange involves a false statement 1.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I see now; exchange is the use of a loose instead of a precise expression, while interchange is the use of both expressions, each in the other’s place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. These subtleties are not unpleasing. Similarly, when we are concerned with a person, it is in our own interest; but when we are concerned for him, it is in his It is true the phrases are sometimes confused, but there are those who observe the distinction; and it is as well to be on the safe side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Quite true.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Now, can you tell me the difference between ‘setting’ and ‘sitting,’ or between ‘be seated ‘ and ‘sit’?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. No; but I have heard you say that ‘sit yourself ‘ is a barbarism.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Yes, quite so; but now I tell you that ‘be seated ‘ is not the same as ‘sit.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Why, what may the difference be?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. When a man is on his legs, you can only tell him to be seated; but if he is seated already, you can tell him to sit still\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sit where thou art; we find us seats elsewhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It means ‘remain sitting,’ you see. Here again we have to say that it is a mistake to reverse the expressions. And as to ‘set’ and ‘sit,’ surely it is the whole difference between transitive and intransitive?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. That is clear enough; go on; this is the way to teach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Or the only way you can learn? Well, do you know what a historian is?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e (The explanation of this point appears to have dropped out of the MSS. — Translators.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Oh, yes, I quite see, after your lucid explanation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Now I daresay you think servility and servitude are the same; but I am aware of a considerable difference between them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Namely —?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. The first depends on yourself, the other on some one else.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. Quite right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Oh, you will pick up all sorts of information, if you give up thinking you know more than you do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pur. I give it up from this moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ly. Then we will break off for the present, and take the rest another time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e H. \u0026amp; F.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1454/43847.html","bookId":1366,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:56:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:56:42 AM"}
