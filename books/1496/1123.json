To deal with those areas where he couldn’t scratch, he simply clamped his legs together tightly. His face was a purplish-red color, and tears continued to flow down his face as he sneezed over and over again. There was also a burning heat that filled him that was driving him crazy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“This is ridiculous bullying! You people are all bullies!!” As he shivered, rage coursed through him, battering at his mind, filling him with thunderous rumbling sounds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he howled and slapped his bag of holding to produce a handful of pills. He wanted revenge! He wanted these imps to realize that on the treacherous path of concocting mystery pills, Bai Xiaochun was the top expert!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd experts don’t like to be challenged!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs it happened, the first thing he pulled out was the strange soul medicine he had used in the Wildlands when he was in conflict with the other two celestial necromancers. It was a toxic medicine that led to flatulence and even diarrhea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as soon as he pulled the pills out, he realized that there was a problem. When inventing and concocting this type of medicine, he had never come up with a name for the pill. Now that he was using it in public fashion, it definitely needed a name!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You people are going to know exactly what makes Bai Xiaochun terrifying!” he shouted. “Body-Purifying Filth-Expelling Pill!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe pills flew forth, and then he waved his sleeve, causing them to explode and become a fine powder that spread out on the wind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn order to make the best use of the effects of the medicine, he employed the greatest speed he possibly could to fly around and throw out as many of his Body-Purifying Filth-Expelling Pills at the Dark Concocters as he could.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCracking sounds rang out, and the imps looked around in astonishment. After all, most of them had a hard time recalling how long it had been since someone had dared to use pill concocting to challenge them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it actually got them excited, and many threw their heads back and laughed uproariously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha! Who would have thought that we would find a kindred spirit here? Nice job, test tube. Very nice job!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I like you, test tube. I think I’ll try your medicinal pill to see exactly what it can do!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t even think of trying to steal this pill. This is a pill duel! I can’t believe that there\u0027s a cultivator who actually dares to take on us Dark Concocters. Hey, test tube, I really admire your bravery!” The Dark Concocters didn’t seem afraid at all, and excitedly struggled to be the first among their fellows to get to the medicine. It was with almost drunken passion that they tried to inhale the crushed powder.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun almost couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Furious, he threw out even more medicinal pills, not even bothering to worry how it might affect his overall supplies. Before long, nearly the whole area was covered with the powder from the Body-Purifying Filth-Expelling Pills. The imps struggled excitedly to breathe in the powder, and then began to wait in anticipation to see what would happen. Soon, strange expressions broke out on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, \u003cem\u003ephhhhhhrt\u003c/em\u003e sounds began to ring out, and some of the imps even clutched their stomachs and squatted into a sitting position….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, it causes diarrhea! Hey, test tube, you’re plagiarizing our medicinal pills! Is that all you can do?!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m impressed. Not a bad medicinal pill. However, definitely not on the level of our pills!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You think this kind of pill will earn you the title of \u003cem\u003ePatriarch Mystery Pill?\u003c/em\u003e I can think of 1,600 different ways of neutralizing this thing.” Numerous imps began pulling out a variety of different antidotes, which they calmly consumed. Clearly, their level of endurance surpassed anything Bai Xiaochun could have imagined. Many of them continued to loudly expel noxious gas, and yet, simply stood there, looking completely calm and unfazed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the derisive looks and sarcastic comments made the entire thing even more humiliating.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Hold your horses!” Bai Xiaochun said, snorting coldly. “Do you really think I would challenge you with only one medicinal pill?!” With that, he waved his hand to produce some of the medicinal pills he had created in the Blood Stream Sect when trying to work with refined corpses, that caused long hair to grow out everywhere on one’s body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA vast number of such pills flew out, followed by popping sounds as they exploded. As the powder spread out, the imps seemed to be taking everything completely in stride. They didn’t even attempt to prevent the medicinal power from landing on them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, they began to grow long, luxuriant hair of various colors. Within moments, many of the Dark Concocters looked like big balls of puffy fur.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Eee?! This medicinal pill isn’t bad at all!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“So, it grows hair. Heavens! How come I never thought of that? It’s a bit itchy though!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“So, you do have a bit of skill after all, test tube. It won’t do you much good though. Check out this antidote!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the imps were initially shocked, they quickly realized they could neutralize the medicinal pill, causing the newly grown hair to begin to shrink back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun wasn’t very worried yet. He hated these imps quite a bit already, and was also a grandmaster in the Dao of medicine. Furthermore, he knew that using one medicinal pill wouldn’t be as effective as using many. Therefore, he began to throw out more pills.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore the entire group of imps could completely deal with the previous pill, his eyes glittered as he resorted to using one of his three super-pills… the Breakup Pill!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIncredible rumblings sounds shook heaven and earth as the Breakup Pills exploded, transforming into a powder that filled the area. It didn’t even need the wind to move, and it was immediately absorbed into the bodies of any of the imps that it touched.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBreakup Pills were very unique, and the Dark Concocters almost immediately noticed this. Even from the way it disseminated, they could tell that there was something different about it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, they were still confident, and didn’t even back up. Some of them were even laughing loudly, and intentionally breathing it in. It didn’t take long before, among those who had intentionally breathed it in, strange expressions appeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“This medicinal pill… has some very strange qualities!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It actually affects your emotions! What pill is this!?” Before any of the imps could begin to study the matter closely, the medicinal effects of the Breakup Pills began to manifest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Get away from me! I\u0027ve decided that my true love is the path of medicine! I\u0027m not meant for you. Let’s break up!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Break up! From now on, you do your thing, and I’ll do mine. And by the way, give me back all those medicinal pills I gave you!” A buzz of conversation immediately filled the Dark Concocters. The emotional changes among the imps were clearly visible, and as for those who hadn’t been infected by the Breakup Pill, they were clearly shocked to see what was happening. Furthermore, they quickly took out various antidotes to see if they could neutralize the effects.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for the first time, their incredibly effective ability to neutralize medicinal effects did not go as smoothly as before. Although there was some success, it wasn’t possible to completely negate the effects in a short time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy now, Bai Xiaochun’s strategy was starting to take effect. Not only did they have to worry about the growing hair, but there was also the effect of the Breakup Pills. And there were even some who were still dealing with diarrhea and flatulence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs the cries of alarm rose up, the Dark Concocters finally began to show signs of fear. Even the spirit automaton up in the air was surprised, and was finally starting to realize that he might have underestimated Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, not a one of them had truly come to understand Bai Xiaochun. Of his three most powerful pills, he still had two more to choose from, both of which were so shocking that even ghosts and gods would fear them!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey were his trump cards when it came to medicinal pills, his Fantasy Pill and his Aphrodisiac Pill!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey were equally vicious, and it was hard to say which was more powerful. If he had greater reserve stocks, he wouldn’t have saved this pill, but now, he gritted his teeth and produced…\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAn Aphrodisiac Pill!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the pill appeared, it was as if the spirit of the world around him shuddered in terror. Thunderous rumblings filled the area, provoking a gasp on the part of Bai Xiaochun. But then, a look of pity appeared on his face as he flicked his sleeve and tossed some Aphrodisiac Pills out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Weep. Struggle. It will do no good. You think a lot of yourselves, Dark Concocters, but in a moment, you will know who your true patriarch is!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1120\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1122\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1121","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
