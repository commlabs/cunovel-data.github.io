While Della finished getting dressed after I\u0027d feasted on her in the shower, I went and got everything ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared the table from last night and toasted her Belgian waffle, then added the orange cream and shaved almonds to the top of it. I also put out a bowl of honey yogurt with figs and goat cheese. These were all items that Jimmy said Della ordered off the breakfast menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came walking out of the bedroom, her hair was pulled up in that sexy bun again and she was dressed for work. Good. I had to talk to her about the new board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope it\u0027s okay if I go to work today,\" she said as she walked into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want to do,\" I told her, then pulled back her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took in the food on the table, then cut her eyes back at me and smirked. \"You got Jimmy to help you with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. No use in denying it. \"I wanted to get it right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped and pressed a kiss to my lips. \"You get everything right.\" Then she sat down at the table and let out a pleased sigh. \"I\u0027m starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wild, hot sex all night and morning will do that to you,\" I replied, and sat down across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed and reached over to take a fig. \"Yes, I guess it will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sticking with a Belgian waffle and butter. The fancy shit wasn\u0027t my thing. I took a bite and watched her eat some before taking a drink of my coffee and preparing myself to ask her to be on my board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fired the board of directors. I hired a new one. People whose opinions I care about,\" I said, getting straight to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDella put her fork down and stared at me. \"Good for you. You\u0027re in charge; you need those close to you helping you with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad she agreed. Not that I expected her not to. \"I want you on the board, Della.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had started to pick up her juice but she set it back down and looked at me like I\u0027d just spoken a foreign language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you on my board. I already have your paperwork ready. You just need to sign it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDella shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea. I mean, maybe later when you\u0027re sure, but right now . . . that\u0027s a hasty move. I mean, just three weeks ago you and Jace were worried about my, uh, problems being an issue. I can\u0027t be on your board. I\u0027m better, but what if I relapse? You don\u0027t want that there and I know your friends agree. I heard Jace. He\u0027s gonna want to see that I\u0027m better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had forgotten about that damn conversation she\u0027d overheard. I stood up and moved around the table, then knelt down in front of her. \"Della, I need you to listen to me. What you heard wasn\u0027t what you think it was. We weren\u0027t talking about you. Never you. We were talking about my mother. She had called board members and caused problems for me. We were discussing her because, unlike you, she really is crazy. Baby, I would never call you those things or allow anyone else to call you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the relief in her eyes. She believed me. She hadn\u0027t brought it up all night and I\u0027d been so damn happy to see her that I hadn\u0027t thought about it. But damn, she was here in my arms thinking I\u0027d said those things. It was humbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and stood up and kissed her. \"Yeah. Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have asked you about it. I was . . . I didn\u0027t want to hear the truth. I was scared of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never be scared to hear the truth from me,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t ask you about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you thought we were talking about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there and studied her hands a moment, then looked up at me. \"I want to be on your board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I can\u0027t do this without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to eating and I had to force myself to eat, too, and not watch her. I just wanted to watch her do everything. Letting her out of my sight today was going to be hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped off the elevator and Vince looked up to greet me. He started to speak and stopped. I watched him as he observed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Della is home, then,\" Vince said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes she is. How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince let out a low laugh. \"I\u0027m old, Woods, not blind. It\u0027s all over your face, boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin that broke out across my face stayed while I went through my morning notes and made scheduled phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight before lunch, Della stepped into my office with a sexy little smile on her face that was going to get her fucked up against my desk if she wasn\u0027t careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you more. Come here,\" I told her, holding out my hand for her to come to me. She walked over to my side of the desk and I pulled her down to my lap. \"Have you had a good morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could have been better,\" I replied, slipping my hand up her skirt. She wiggled in my lap and slapped my hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that. We have work to talk about,\" she said playfully, and then tried to stand up. I held her to my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead and wiggle, baby. It feels real good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so bad,\" she said, stopping me from slipping my hand between her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m playing catch-up. I have three weeks\u0027 worth,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Kerrington, Mr. Rush Finlay is here to see you,\" Vince announced over the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, Rush. Forgot he was coming by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDella jumped up out of my lap and straightened her skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in,\" I said as I watched her fix herself. I was going to mess it up as soon as Rush brought me the info on Nate\u0027s trust fund that he\u0027d set up for Dean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush walked into the room with Nate in his arms and a baby bag over his shoulder. That was funny shit. Rush Finlay, badass rock star\u0027s son, had a baby bag and a baby in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you brought Nate!\" Della\u0027s excitement interested me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her walk over to Rush and take Nate from him. She walked over to the sofa with him, cooing and making him laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u0027s chuckle reminded me he was there. I shifted my attention back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She likes babies,\" Rush said with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t known she liked babies. I liked watching her with Nate. Rush was going to be hard to concentrate on. \"Yeah, she does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did she come back? Or did you chase her down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night. She came back to me,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told you that hand wasn\u0027t over,\" Rush said, then took a seat across from my desk. \"Stop mentally fucking her while she\u0027s holding my kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him an annoyed glare that just amused him. \"Here\u0027s the paperwork for Nate\u0027s trust. Do the same with my paycheck from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done. I\u0027ll get the direct deposits set up today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush let out a sigh. \"I might just sit here a minute and take a break. Della looks like she\u0027s having fun and I\u0027m beat. Grant was at my house late last night and we had to deal with some shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Nan back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush let out a weary sigh and rubbed his forehead. \"Yeah. She\u0027s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" I said, more for Rush\u0027s sake than anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Rush agreed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-35.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
