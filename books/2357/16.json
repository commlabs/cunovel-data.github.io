He had been impulsive and idealistic, trying to protect a young girl who seemed lost and vulnerable to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would give anything not to hurt Mary Beth, but Adam was deeply in love with Jennifer. He needed someone to talk to, and he decided on Stewart Needham. Stewart had always been sympathetic. He would understand Adam\u0027s position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting turned out to be quite different from what Adam had planned. As Adam walked into Stewart Needham\u0027s office, Needham said, \"Perfect timing. I\u0027ve just been on the phone with the election committee. They\u0027re formally asking you to run for the United States Senate. You\u0027ll have the full backing of the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - that\u0027s wonderful,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a lot to do, my boy. We have to start organizing things. I\u0027ll set up a fund-raising committee. Here\u0027s where I think we should begin...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next two hours, they discussed plans for the campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had finished, Adam said, \"Stewart, there\u0027s something personal I\u0027d like to talk to you about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m late for a client now, Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Adam had the sudden feeling that Stewart Needham had known what was on Adam\u0027s mind all the while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam had a date to meet Jennifer for lunch at a dairy restaurant on the West Side. She was waiting for him in a rear booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam walked in, charged with energy, and from his expression Jennifer knew that something had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some news for you,\" Adam told her. \"I\u0027ve been asked to run for the United States Senate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Adam!\" Jennifer was filled with a sudden excitement. \"That\u0027s wonderful! You\u0027ll make such a great senator!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The competition\u0027s going to be fierce. New York\u0027s a tough state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. No one can stop you.\" And Jennifer knew it was true. Adam was intelligent and courageous, willing to fight the battles he believed in. As he had once fought her battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer took his hand and said warmly, \"I\u0027m so proud of you, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy, I haven\u0027t been elected yet. You\u0027ve heard about cups, lips and slips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has nothing to do with my being proud of you. I love you so much, Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam thought about telling Jennifer of the discussion he had almost had with Stewart Needham, but he decided not to. It could wait until he had straightened things out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you start campaigning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want me to announce that I\u0027m running right away. I\u0027ll have unanimous party backing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something that was not wonderful tugging at the back of Jennifer\u0027s mind. It was something she did not want to put into words, but she knew that sooner or later she was going to have to face it. She wanted Adam to win, but the Senate race would be a sword of Damocles hanging over her head. If Adam won, Jennifer would lose him. He would be running on a reform ticket and there would be no margin in his life for any scandal. He was a married man and if it was learned he had a mistress, it would be political suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, for the first time since she had fallen in love with Adam, Jennifer had insomnia. She was awake until dawn battling the demons of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCynthia said, \"There\u0027s a call waiting for you. It\u0027s the Martian again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at her blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, the one with the story about the insane asylum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had put the man completely out of her mind. He obviously was someone in need of psychiatric help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him to - \" She sighed. \"Never mind. I\u0027ll tell him myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the telephone. \"Jennifer Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar voice said, \"Did you check the information I gave you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t had a chance.\" She remembered she had thrown away the notes she had made. \"I\u0027d like to help you. Will you give me your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" he whispered. \"They\u0027ll come after me, too. You just check it out. Helen Cooper. Long Island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can recommend a doctor who - \" The line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer sat there a moment, thinking, and then asked Ken Bailey to come into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up, Chief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing - I think. I\u0027ve had a couple of crank calls from someone who won\u0027t leave his name. Would you please see if you can find out anything about a woman named Helen Cooper. She\u0027s supposed to have had a large estate on Long Island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either in some insane asylum or on Mars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, Ken Bailey walked in and surprised Jennifer by saying, \"Your Martian has landed. There\u0027s a Helen Cooper committed at The Heathers Asylum in Westchester.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Ken Bailey looked hurt. \"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" Jennifer said. Ken was the best investigator she had ever known. He never said anything unless he was positive of it, and he never got his facts wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s our interest in the lady?\" Ken asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone thinks she\u0027s been framed into the asylum. I\u0027d like you to check out her background. I want to know about her family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe information was on Jennifer\u0027s desk the following morning. Helen Cooper was a dowager who had been left a fortune of four million dollars by her late husband. Her daughter had married the superintendent of the building where they lived and, six months after the marriage, the bride and groom had gone to court to ask that the mother be declared incompetent, and that the estate be put under their control. They had found three psychiatrists who had testified to Helen Cooper\u0027s incompetency and the court had committed her to the asylum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer finished reading the report and looked up at Ken Bailey. \"The whole thing sounds a little fishy, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fishy? You could wrap it up in a newspaper and serve it with chips. What are you going to do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a difficult question. Jennifer had no client. If Mrs. Cooper\u0027s family had had her locked away, they certainly would not welcome Jennifer\u0027s interference, and since the woman herself had been declared insane, she was not competent to hire Jennifer. It was an interesting problem. One thing Jennifer knew: Client or not, she was not going to stand by and see someone railroaded into an insane asylum. \"I\u0027m going to pay a visit to Mrs. Cooper,\" Jennifer decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heathers Asylum was located in Westchester in a large, wooded area. The grounds were fenced in and the only access was through a guarded gate. Jennifer was not yet ready to let the family know what she was doing, so she had telephoned around until she had found an acquaintance with a connection to the sanatorium. He had made arrangements for her to pay a visit to Mrs. Cooper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head of the asylum, Mrs. Franklin, was a dour, hard-faced woman who reminded Jennifer of Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strictly speaking,\" Mrs. Franklin sniffed, \"I should not be letting you talk to Mrs. Cooper. However, we\u0027ll call this an unofficial visit. It won\u0027t go in the records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have her brought in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Cooper was a slim, attractive-looking woman in her late sixties. She had vivid blue eyes that blazed with intelligence, and she was as gracious as though she were receiving Jennifer in her own home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was good of you to come and visit me,\" Mrs. Cooper said, \"but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not quite sure why you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an attorney, Mrs. Cooper. I received two anonymous telephone calls telling me you were in here and that you didn\u0027t belong here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Cooper smiled gently. \"That must have been Albert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Albert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was my butler for twenty-five years. When my daughter, Dorothy, married, she fired him.\" She sighed. \"Poor Albert. He really belongs to the past, to another world. I suppose, in a sense, I do too. You\u0027re very young, my dear, so perhaps you\u0027re not aware of how much things have changed. Do you know what\u0027s missing today? Graciousness. It\u0027s been replaced, I\u0027m afraid, by greed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer asked quietly, \"Your daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Cooper\u0027s eyes saddened. \"I don\u0027t blame Dorothy. It\u0027s her husband. He\u0027s not a very attractive man, not morally, at least. I\u0027m afraid my daughter is not very attractive physically. Herbert married Dorothy for her money and found out that the estate was entirely in my hands. He didn\u0027t like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he say that to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes indeed. My son-in-law was quite open about it. He thought I should give my daughter the estate then, instead of making her wait until I died. I would have, except that I didn\u0027t trust him. I knew what would happen if he ever got his hands on all that money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever had any history of mental illness, Mrs. Cooper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Cooper looked at Jennifer and said wryly, \"According to the doctors, I\u0027m suffering from schizophrenia and paranoia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had the feeling that she had never spoken to a more sane person in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are aware that three doctors testified that you were incompetent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Cooper estate is valued at four million dollars, Miss Parker. You can influence a lot of doctors for that kind of money. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re wasting your time. My son-in-law controls the estate now. He\u0027ll never let me leave here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to meet your son-in-law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Plaza Towers was on East 72nd Street, in one of the most beautiful residential areas of New York. Helen Cooper had her own penthouse there. Now the name plate on the door read Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Hawthorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had telephoned ahead to the daughter, Dorothy, and when Jennifer arrived at the apartment, both Dorothy and her husband were waiting for her. Helen Cooper had been right about her daughter. She was not attractive. She was thin and mousy-looking, with no chin, and her right eye had a cast in it. Her husband, Herbert, looked like a clone of Archie Bunker. He was at least twenty years older than Dorothy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on in,\" he grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe escorted Jennifer from the reception hall into an enormous living room, the walls of which were covered with paintings by French and Dutch masters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawthorne said to Jennifer bluntly, \"Now, suppose you tell me what the hell this is all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer turned to the girl. \"It\u0027s about your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did she first start showing signs of insanity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerbert Hawthorne interrupted. \"Right after Dorothy and me got married. The old lady couldn\u0027t stand me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s certainly one proof of sanity, Jennifer thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read the doctors\u0027 reports,\" Jennifer said. \"They seemed biased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, biased?\" His tone was truculent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I mean is that the reports indicated that they were dealing in gray areas where there were no clear-cut criteria for establishing what society calls sanity. Their decision was shaped, in part, by what you and your wife told them about Mrs. Cooper\u0027s behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you tryin\u0027 to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying that the evidence is not clear-cut. Three other doctors could have come up with an entirely different conclusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, look,\" Herbert Hawthorne said, \"I dunno what you think you\u0027re tryin\u0027 to pull, but the old lady\u0027s a looney. The doctors said so and the court said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read the court transcript,\" Jennifer replied. \"The court also suggested that her case be periodically reviewed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was consternation on Herbert Hawthorne\u0027s face. \"You mean they might let her out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to let her out,\" Jennifer promised. \"I\u0027m going to see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute! What the hell is goin\u0027 on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I intend to find out.\" Jennifer turned to the girl. \"I checked out your mother\u0027s previous medical history. There has never been anything wrong with her, mentally or emotionally. She - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerbert Hawthorne interrupted. \"That don\u0027t mean a damn thing! These things can come on fast. She - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In addition,\" Jennifer continued to Dorothy, \"I checked on your mother\u0027s social activities before you had her put away. She lived a completely normal life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you or anybody else says. She\u0027s crazy!\" Herbert Hawthorne shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer turned to him and studied him a moment. \"Did you ask Mrs. Cooper to give the estate to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s none of your goddamned business!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m making it my business. I think that\u0027s all for now.\" Jennifer moved toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerbert Hawthorne stepped in front of her, blocking her way. \"Wait a minute. You\u0027re buttin\u0027 in where you\u0027re not wanted. You\u0027re lookin\u0027 to make a little cash for yourself, right? Okay, I understand that, honey. Tell you what I\u0027ll do. Why don\u0027t I give you a check right now for a thousand dollars for services rendered and you just drop this whole thing. Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Jennifer replied. \"No deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you\u0027re gonna get more from the old lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jennifer said. She looked him in the eye. \"Only one of us is in this for the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took six weeks of hearings and psychiatric consultations and conferences with four different state agencies. Jennifer brought in her own psychiatrists and when they were finished with their examinations and Jennifer had laid out all the facts at her disposal, the judge reversed his earlier decision and Helen Cooper was released and her estate restored to her control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning of Mrs. Cooper\u0027s release she telephoned Jennifer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to take you to lunch at Twenty-One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at her calendar. She had a crowded morning, a luncheon date and a busy afternoon in court, but she knew how much this meant to the elderly woman. \"I\u0027ll be there,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Cooper\u0027s voice was pleased. \"We\u0027ll have a little celebration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe luncheon went beautifully. Mrs. Cooper was a thoughtful hostess, and obviously they knew her well at 21.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry Berns escorted them to a table upstairs, where they were surrounded by beautiful antiques and Georgian silver. The food and service were superb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Cooper waited until they were having their coffee. Then she said to Jennifer, \"I\u0027m very grateful to you, my dear. I don\u0027t know how large a fee you were planning to charge, but I want to give you something more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fees are high enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Cooper shook her head. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" She leaned forward, took Jennifer\u0027s hands in hers and dropped her voice to a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to give you Wyoming.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-16.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
