The fungal-culture whiskey on the low black table beside him remained at the same level in the glass as when he\u0027d bought it. It wasn\u0027t really a drink. It was permission to sit. There had always been a handful of drifters, even on Ceres. Men and women whose luck had run out. No place to go, no one to ask favors of. No connection to the vast net of humanity. He\u0027d always felt a kind of sympathy for them, his spiritual kindred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was part of that disconnected tribe in earnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething bright happened on the skin of the great generation ship - a welding array firing off some intricate network of subtle connection, maybe. Past the Nauvoo, nestled in the constant hive-like activity of Tycho Station, was a half-degree arc of the Rocinante, like a home he\u0027d once had. He knew the story of Moses seeing a promised land he would never enter. Miller wondered how the old prophet would have felt if he\u0027d been ushered in for a moment - a day, a week, a year - and then dropped back out in the desert. Kinder never to leave the wastelands. Safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Juliette Mao watched him from the corner of his mind carved out for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was supposed to save you, he thought. I was supposed to find you. Find the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd didn\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her, and she smiled back, as world-weary and tired as he was. Because of course he had. He\u0027d found her, he\u0027d found who killed her, and Holden was right. He\u0027d taken revenge. All that he\u0027d promised himself, he\u0027d done. Only it hadn\u0027t saved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor half a second, Miller thought Julie had said it. The serving girl had opened her mouth to ask him again before he shook his head. She couldn\u0027t. And even if she had been able to, he couldn\u0027t afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou knew it couldn\u0027t last, Julie said. Holden. His crew. You knew you didn\u0027t really belong there. You belong with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden shot of adrenaline revved his tired heart. He looked around for her, but Julie was gone. His own privately generated fight-or-flight reaction didn\u0027t have room for daydream hallucinations. And still. You belong with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered how many people he\u0027d known who had taken that path. Cops had a tradition of eating their guns that went back to long before humanity had lifted itself up the gravity well. Here he was, without a home, without a friend, with more blood on his hands from the past month than from his whole career before it. The in-house shrink on Ceres called it suicidal ideation in his yearly presentation to the security teams. Something to watch out for, like genital lice or high cholesterol. Not a big deal if you were careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he\u0027d be careful. For a while. See where it went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, hesitated for three heartbeats, then scooped up his bourbon and drank it in a gulp. Liquid courage, they called it, and it seemed to do the trick. He pulled up his terminal, put in a connect request, and tried to compose himself. He wasn\u0027t there yet. And if he was going to live, he needed a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sabez nichts, Pampaw,\" Diogo said. The kid was wearing a meshwork shirt and pants cut in a fashion as youthful as it was ugly, and in his previous life, Miller would probably have written him off as too young to know anything useful. Now Miller waited. If anything could wring a prospect out of Diogo, it would be the promise of Miller getting a hole of his own. The silence dragged. Miller forced himself not to speak for fear of begging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... \" Diogo said warily. \"Well. There\u0027s one hombre might could. Just arm and eye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security guard work\u0027s fine with me,\" Miller said. \"Anything that pays the bills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Il conversa a do. Hear what\u0027s said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate anything you can do,\" Miller replied, then gestured at the bed. \"You mind if I...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi cama es su cama,\" Diogo said. Miller lay down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiogo stepped into the small shower, and the sound of water against flesh drowned out the air cycler. Even on board ship, Miller hadn\u0027t lived in physical circumstances this intimate with anyone since his marriage. Still, he wouldn\u0027t have gone as far as to call Diogo a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpportunity was thinner on Tycho than he\u0027d hoped, and he didn\u0027t have much by way of references. The few people who knew him weren\u0027t likely to speak on his behalf. But surely there\u0027d be something. All he needed was a way to remake himself, to start over and be someone different from who he\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssuming, of course, that Earth or Mars - whichever one came out on top of the war - didn\u0027t then wipe the OPA and all the stations loyal to it out of the sky. And that the protomolecule didn\u0027t escape Eros and slaughter a planet. Or a station. Or him. He had a moment\u0027s chill, recalling that there was still a sample of the thing on board the Roci. If something happened with it, Holden and Naomi, Alex and Amos might all join Julie long before Miller did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told himself that wasn\u0027t his problem anymore. Still, he hoped they\u0027d be all right. He wanted them to be well, even if he wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oi, Pampaw,\" Diogo said as the door to the public hall slid open. \"You hear that Eros started talking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller lifted himself to one elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si,\" Diogo said. \"Whatever that shit is, it started broadcasting. There\u0027s even words and shit. I\u0027ve got a feed. You want a listen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Miller thought. No, I have seen those corridors. What\u0027s happened to those people almost happened to me. I don\u0027t want anything to do with that abomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiogo scooped up his own hand terminal and keyed in something. Miller\u0027s terminal chimed that it had received the new feed route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chica perdida in ops been mixing a bunch of it to bhangra,\" Diogo said, making a shifting dance move with his hips. \"Hard-core, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiogo and the other OPA irregulars had breached a high-value research station, faced down one of the most powerful and evil corporations in a history of power and evil. And now they were making music from the screams of the dying. Of the dead. They were dancing to it in the low-rent clubs. What it must be like, Miller thought, to be young and soulless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. That wasn\u0027t fair. Diogo was a good kid. He was just naive. The universe would take care of that, given a little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard-core,\" Miller said. Diogo grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feed sat in queue, waiting. Miller turned out the lights, letting the little bed bear him up against the press of spin. He didn\u0027t want to hear. He didn\u0027t want to know. He had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the sound was nothing - electric squeals and a wildly fluting static. Then, maybe somewhere deep in the back of it, music. A chorus of violas churning away together in a long, distant crescendo. And then, as clear as if someone were speaking into a microphone, a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rabbits and hamsters. Ecologically unstabilizing and round and blue as moonbeams. August.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost certainly wasn\u0027t a real person. The computer systems on Eros could generate any number of perfectly convincing dialects and voices. Men\u0027s, women\u0027s, children\u0027s. And how many millions of hours of data could there be on the computers and storage dumps all through the station?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother electronic flutter, like finches looped back against themselves. A new voice - feminine and soft this time - with a throbbing pulse behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patient complains of rapid heartbeat and night sweats. Symptom onset reported as three months previous, but with a history... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice faded, and the throbbing rose. Like an old man with Swiss cheese holes in his brain, the complex system that had been Eros was dying, changing, losing its mind. And because Protogen had wired it all for sound, Miller could listen to the station fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t tell him, I didn\u0027t tell him, I didn\u0027t tell him. The sunrise. I\u0027ve never seen the sunrise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller closed his eyes and slid down toward sleep, serenaded by Eros. As consciousness faded, he imagined a body in the bed beside him, warm and alive and breathing slowly in time with the rise and fall of the static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager was a thin man, weedy, with hair combed high above his brow like a wave that never crashed. The office hunched close around them, humming at odd moments when the infrastructure - water, air, energy - of Tycho impinged on it. A business built between ducts, improvisational and cheap. The lowest of the low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the manager said. Miller felt his gut tighten and sink. Of all the humiliations the universe had in store for him, this one he hadn\u0027t foreseen. It made him angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I can\u0027t handle it?\" he asked, keeping his voice soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that,\" the weedy man said. \"It\u0027s... Look, between us, we\u0027re looking for a thumb, you know? Someone\u0027s idiot kid brother could guard this warehouse. You\u0027ve got all this experience. What do we need with riot control protocols? Or investigative procedure? I mean, come on. This gig doesn\u0027t even come with a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" Miller said. \"I need something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weedy man sighed and gave the exaggerated shrug of a Belter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need something else,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller tried not to laugh, afraid it would sound like despair. He stared at the cheap plastic wall behind the manager until the guy started to get uncomfortable. It was a trap. He was too experienced to start over. He knew too much, so there was no going back and doing fresh beginnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said at last, and the manager across the desk from him let out a breath, then had the good grace to look embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I just ask,\" the weedy man said. \"Why did you leave your old job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ceres changed hands,\" Miller said, putting on his hat. \"I wasn\u0027t on the new team. That was all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ceres?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager looked confused, which in turn confused Miller. He glanced down at his own hand terminal. There was his work history, just the way he\u0027d presented it. The manager couldn\u0027t have missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where I was,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the police thing. But I meant the last job. I mean, I\u0027ve been around, I understand not putting OPA work on your resume, but you have to figure we all know that you were part of the thing... you know, with the station. And all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I was working for the OPA,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weedy man blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich, after all, was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing had changed in Fred Johnson\u0027s office, and everything had. The furnishings, the smell of the air, the sense of its existing somewhere between a boardroom and a command and control center. The generation ship outside the window might have been half a percent closer to completion, but that wasn\u0027t it. The stakes of the game had shifted, and what had been a war was something else now. Something bigger. It shone in Fred\u0027s eyes and tightened his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could use a man with your skills,\" Fred agreed. \"It\u0027s always the small-scale things that trip you up. How to frisk someone. That kind of thing. Tycho security can handle themselves, but once we\u0027re off our station and shooting our way into someone else\u0027s, not as much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that something you\u0027re looking to do more of?\" Miller said, trying to make it a casual joke. Fred didn\u0027t answer. For a moment, Julie stood at the general\u0027s side. Miller saw the pair of them reflected in the screens, the man pensive, the ghost amused. Maybe Miller had gotten it wrong from the start, and the divide between the Belt and the inner planets was something besides politics and resource management. He knew as well as anyone that the Belt offered a harder, more dangerous life than Mars or Earth provided. And yet it called these people - the best people - out of humanity\u0027s gravity wells to cast themselves into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impulse to explore, to stretch, to leave home. To go as far as possible out into the universe. And now that Protogen and Eros offered the chance to become gods, to recreate humanity into beings that could go beyond merely human hopes and dreams, it occurred to Miller how hard it would be for men like Fred to turn that temptation away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed Dresden,\" Fred said. \"That\u0027s a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It needed to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure it did,\" Fred replied, but his voice was careful. Testing. Miller smiled, a little sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why it needed to happen,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small, coughing laugh told Miller that Fred understood him. When the general turned back to consider him again, his gaze was steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it comes to the negotiating table, someone\u0027s going to have to answer for it. You killed a defenseless man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the time comes, I will hand-feed you to the wolves as the first chip I offer. I won\u0027t protect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t ask you to protect me,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it meant being a Belter ex-cop in an Earth-side prison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a euphemism, and they both knew it. You belong with me, Julie said. And so what did it matter, really, how he got there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got no regrets,\" he said, and half a breath later was shocked to discover it was almost true. \"If there\u0027s a judge out there who wants to ask me about something, I\u0027ll answer. I\u0027m looking for a job here, not protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred sat in his chair, eyes narrow and thoughtful. Miller leaned forward in his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got me in a hard position,\" Fred said. \"You\u0027re saying all the right things. But I have a hard time trusting that you\u0027d follow through. Keeping you on the books would be risky. It could undermine my position in the peace negotiations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a risk,\" Miller said. \"But I\u0027ve been on Eros and Thoth station. I flew on the Rocinante with Holden and his crew. When it comes to analysis of the protomolecule and how we got into this mess, there isn\u0027t anyone in a better position to give you information. You can argue I knew too much. That I was too valuable to let go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or too dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Or that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a moment. On the Nauvoo, a bank of lights glittered in a gold-and-green test pattern and then went dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security consultant,\" Fred said. \"Independent. I won\u0027t give you a rank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too dirty for the OPA, Miller thought with a glow of amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it comes with my own bunk, I\u0027ll take it,\" he said. It was only until the war was over. After that, he was meat for the machine. That was fine. Fred leaned back. His chair hissed softly into its new configuration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Fred said. \"Here\u0027s your first job. Give me your analysis. What\u0027s my biggest problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Containment,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I can\u0027t keep the information about Thoth station and the protomolecule quiet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can\u0027t,\" Miller said. \"For one thing, too many people already know. For another thing, one of them\u0027s Holden, and if he hasn\u0027t already broadcast the whole thing on every empty frequency, he will soon. And besides that, you can\u0027t make a peace deal without explaining what the hell\u0027s going on. Sooner or later, it has to come out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you advise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Miller was back in the darkness, listening to the gibbers of the dying station. The voices of the dead calling to him from across the vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Defend Eros,\" he said. \"All sides are going to want samples of the protomolecule. Locking down access is going to be the only way you get yourself a seat at that table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice thought,\" he said. \"But how do propose we defend something the size of Eros Station if Earth and Mars bring their navies to bear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good point. Miller felt a tug of sorrow. Even though Julie Mao - his Julie - was dead and gone, it felt like disloyalty to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you have to get rid of it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how would I do that?\" Fred said. \"Even if we studded the thing with nukes, how would we be sure that no little scrap of the thing would make its way to a colony or down a well? Blowing that thing up would be like blowing dandelion fluff into the breeze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller had never seen a dandelion, but he saw the problem. Even the smallest portion of the goo filling Eros might be enough to start the whole evil experiment over again. And the goo thrived on radiation; simply cooking the station might hurry the thing along its occult path rather than end it. To be sure that the protomolecule on Eros never spread, they\u0027d need to break everything on the station down to its constituent atoms...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You\u0027re not going to like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. You asked. You drive Eros into the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into the sun,\" Fred said. \"Do you have any idea how much mass we\u0027re talking about here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller nodded to the wide, clear expanse of window, to the construction yards beyond it. To the Nauvoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big engines on that thing,\" Miller said. \"Get some fast ships out to the station, make sure no one can get in before you get there. Run the Nauvoo into Eros Station. Knock it sunward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred\u0027s gaze turned inward as he planned, calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to make sure no one gets into it until it hits corona. That\u0027ll be hard, but Earth and Mars are both just as interested in keeping the other guy from having it as in getting it themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t do better, Julie, he thought. But it\u0027ll be a hell of a funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred\u0027s breath grew slow and deep, his gaze flickering as if he were reading something in the air that only he could see. Miller didn\u0027t interrupt, even when the silence got heavy. It was almost a minute later that Fred let out a short, percussive breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mormons are going to be pissed,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-45.html","bookId":2454,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM"}
