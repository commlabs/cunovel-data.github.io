And a pain that engulfed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher whole body, sending agonized spasms through her limbs. It centered in her chest, though, where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething white-hot was lodged inside her, crushing her lung and dislodging her internal organs and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburning right beside her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been staked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she had done so often to others had been done to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t realized anything could hurt like this. She was glad none of her victims had lived long to keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wood of the stake was poisoning her heart, she knew. Even if it were removed, she would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo vampire could survive contact between living wood and its undead heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she would live for a little while-in unimaginable agony as the poison ate through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice was screaming in her mind. Jez-JezJezJez... Over and over, incoherently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead, she thought. And she hoped he wasn\u0027t feeling any of what she was feeling through the silver\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecord that connected them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh and Claire were sobbing. Jez wished they wouldn\u0027t. They had to stay calm; to think of a way to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esave themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she couldn\u0027t help them anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the sobbing she heard a shrill and angry voice. Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is wrong with you?\" Lily was saying. \"Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s happening to her? Don\u0027t you want to save her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the red haze that filled Jez\u0027s vision, she felt dim approval. They were doing what she\u0027d told\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. Whichever of them was the Wild Power was suppressing it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. That was what mattered. Although she couldn\u0027t really remember why any longer....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a face broke through the red haze. It was Lily, bending over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you understand?\" Lily yelled. \"You can stop this right now. Ill have him kill you cleanly-all the pain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewill be over. All you have to do is tell me who it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez smiled at her faintly. She couldn\u0027t breathe to answer, and she didn\u0027t want to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould you believe that I don\u0027t know? she thought. No, I don\u0027t think you would. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was getting less by itself. It was as if Jez was moving farther and farther away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be so stupid?\" Lily was screaming. Her face was twisted, and to Jez\u0027s vision, floating in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escarlet mist. She looked like a monster. Then she turned and seemed to be screaming at someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Get the other vampire down here, too. Morgead.\" She was looking at Jez again. \"We\u0027ll just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave to stake your friends one after another until the Wild Power decides to reveal itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly everything was much clearer around Jez. She could see the room again, and she could feel her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown body. There was still the roaring in her ears, but she could hear Claire\u0027s sobs over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Lily couldn\u0027t mean it. This couldn\u0027t be happening....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was. They were shoving Morgead down on the floor beside her, and Claire and Hugh beyond\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim. The thugs with spears were getting into position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No. This can\u0027t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez wanted to scream at them, to tell the Wild Power to do something, because everything was lost now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanyway. But she didn\u0027t have air to scream. And she felt so adrift and confused anyway.... Her universe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad become disjointed. Her thoughts seemed to be unraveling at all once, past memories combining with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflashing sensory impressions from the present, and with strange new ideas....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was involuntary, why didn\u0027t the Wild Power work magic more often? Unless there was some other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erequirement....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t let this happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dampness of blood spreading around her heart. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire\u0027s nails digging into her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When there\u0027s no physical way to escape ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower in the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire on the floor there. Screaming and screaming...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething building inside her, hotter than the stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead beside her whispering, \"Jez, I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce with the stake over him. Morgead looking up unafraid....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHotter than the heart of a star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh in the distance saying almost quietly, \"Goddess of Life, receive us; guide us to the other world. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHotter than the sun and colder and bluer than the moon, like fire that burned and froze and crackled like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elightning all at once. Something that filled her with an energy that was past rage and past love and past all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econtrolling and that she recognized in her soul even though she\u0027d never consciously felt it before. It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eswelling Jez to bursting, a pure and terrible flame that was never meant to be unleashed like this....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\" Lily shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jez let it free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came roaring out from her in a silent explosion. Blue fire that streamed from her body and blasted in all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edirections, but especially up. It came out and out and out, engulfing everything, flowing from her in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever ending torrent. Like a solar flare that didn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all she could see. Blue flames, streaked with blue-white lightning that crackled almost soundlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the fire that had cocooned her on the BART tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that now she could tell where it was coming from, even if she couldn\u0027t direct it. She knew how to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elet it out, now, but once out it did what it wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t meant to be used this way. That was the only thing she knew clearly about it. She\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eletting it slip out when she was desperately upset-when she was worried for someone\u0027s life, and she knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat she couldn\u0027t do anything else to save them. That was forgivable, because it had been unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t. She was probably violating some law of the universe or something. The blue fire was only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeant to be used in the last battle, when the darkness came and the Four were called to stand against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose that means I should try to stop now, Jez thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure how to do it. She guessed that she needed to call it back, somehow, to draw it down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto her body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if I sort of tug....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did-something. A gathering-up with her mind. It was harder than letting the fire go had been, but it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworked. She could feel it returning, flooding back inside her, as if she were sucking it in. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was gone, and Jez could see the world again. Could see what it had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr most of it, anyway. There was about a foot and a half of ragged wall left all around, with charred\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einsulation spilling out. Blue energy like electricity ran along the edges here and there, fizzing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than that, no house. Not even chunks of wreckage lying around. There were fine bits of debris\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloating down, making the sunlight hazy, but that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got... vaporized, Jez thought, searching for the right word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Lily. No Azarius. No Pierce. And none of the ugly thugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddess, Jez thought. I didn\u0027t mean to do that. I only wanted to stop them from hurting Morgead and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire and Hugh. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about them? she thought in a sudden panic. She turned her head, painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were there. And alive. They were even stirring. The cords they\u0027d been tied with were lying on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecarpet, sizzling with that same blue energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s so weird to have a carpet without a house to go with it, Jez thought fuzzily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going away again. And that was too bad, but at least it didn\u0027t hurt anymore. The pain was gone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompletely, replaced by a warm and sleepy feeling-and the sensation of gently floating outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyelids felt heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez? Jez!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a husky whisper. Jez opened her eyes to see Morgead\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was crying. Oh, dear, that was bad. Jez hadn\u0027t seen him cry since... when was it? Sometime when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey\u0027d been little kids....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez, can you hear me? Now he was talking in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez blinked again, and tried to think of something comforting to say to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel warm,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t!\" He said it almost in a growl. Then he looked behind him, and Jez saw Hugh and Claire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrawling up. They were all shining with golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so pretty,\" she told them. \"Like angels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t the time for your weird humor!\" Morgead shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! Don\u0027t yell at her!\" That was Claire. Claire was crying, too, lovely tears that shone as they fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and took Jez\u0027s hand, and that was nice, although Jez couldn\u0027t exactly feel it. She could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to be all right,\" Morgead was snarling. \"She\u0027s lost blood, but she\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was stroking Jez\u0027s hair off her face. She felt that; it was pleasant. She frowned slowly at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead, because there was something important to tell him, and talking was difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Hugh...\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Hugh your freaking self! He\u0027s right here! And you\u0027re not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez blinked with the difficulty changing focus. Yes, there was Hugh. He was the one stroking her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh... the prophecy. I figured out what the two eyes watching were. They\u0027re the sun and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoon-get it? Two eyes... for somebody who belongs to both worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Day World and the Night World,\" Hugh said softly. \"You got it, Jez. That was so smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And blood,\" Jez whispered. \u0027\"Power in the blood\u0027-that\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t do it anytime I wanted. Blood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehas to flow before you can let out the power. The first two times Claire was scratching me. And this time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . .\" Her voice died off, but it wasn\u0027t important. Everybody could see the blood this time, she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh\u0027s voice was thick. \"That was smart, too, Jez. You figured it out. And you saved us. You did\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverything just right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... because there\u0027s only going to be three Wild Powers now....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, there aren\u0027t,\" Morgead raged. \"Listen to me, Jez. There\u0027s no reason for you to die-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez couldn\u0027t manage a smile anymore, or a sentence. But she whispered gently, \"Wood... poison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t! Not to humans. And you\u0027re half human, Jez. You\u0027re vampire enough to survive something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat would kill a human, but you\u0027re human enough not to be poisoned by wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez knew better. She couldn\u0027t see much anymore. Only Morgead, and he was getting indistinct. It wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat the world was dimming, though-it was getting brighter. Everything was golden and shining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour less one and darkness triumphs, Jez thought I\u0027m so sorry about that. I hope they can manage it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomehow. It would be so sad for everything human to be lost. There\u0027s so much good in the world, and so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch to love....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t even see Morgead now. Only gold. But she could hear. She could hear Claire whispering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto her in a voice broken by tears, and feel wetness dropping on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Jez. You\u0027re the best cousin anybody could ever have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hugh. He was crying, too. \"Jez, I\u0027m so proud to be your friend....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, through the mist and the gold and the warmth and peace, came a voice that wasn\u0027t gentle at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall. That was roaring in sheer outrage and fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"DONT YOU DARE DIE ON ME, JEZEBEL! DON\u0027T YOU DARE! Or I\u0027ll follow you to the next\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld and KILL you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, in the pretty gold mist, she could see something else. The only thing in the universe that wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a silver cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You come back and you do it right now,\" Morgead bellowed in her ears and in her mind. \"Right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe peace was shattered. Nothing seemed quite so warm and wonderful anymore, and she knew that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonce Morgead got into one of his Excited States, he wouldn\u0027t stop yelling until he got what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the cord right in front of her. It was strong, and she could feel that the other end was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomewhere in. Morgead\u0027s heart, and that he was trying to drag her back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. Maybe if I just grab on....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, she was holding on to it, and bit by bit, pulling herself back. And then the golden light was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efading and she was inside a body that hurt and Morgead was holding her and kissing her and crying all at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire\u0027s voice came from beyond him. \"She\u0027s breathing again! She\u0027s breathing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, you stupid human,\" Morgead gasped against Jez\u0027s cheek. \"I can\u0027t live without you. Don\u0027t you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez whispered, \"I told you never to call me Jezebel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time for a nice bath,\" the nurse said. \"And then we can have a visitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez eyed her narrowly. The woman was kind, but she had some mania for sponge baths, and she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealways putting strange-smelling ingredients in the water. Which was actually not that surprising since she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas a witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skip the bath,\" Jez said. \"Let the visitor in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, now,\" the witch said, shaking a finger and advancing with the sponge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez sighed. Being a Wild Power in a Circle Daybreak sanctuary meant that she could have pretty much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything she wanted-except that everyone was still treating her like a little kid. Especially the nurses, who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espoiled her and flattered her, but talked to her as if she were about three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she was glad to let the Circle take care of some things. Keeping her relatives safe, for instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she was almost fully recovered, thanks to a strong constitution and a lot of healing spells from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe witches, she wasn\u0027t up to that yet. Uncle Bracken and the entire Goddard family needed constant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprotection, since Hunter Redfern and the Night World Council were all undoubtedly after them by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Circle had imported some experts from back East to take care of it. A rival vampire hunter, of all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings, named Rashel something. Plus her soulmate, a vampire-turned-Daybreaker called Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least they were competent. They\u0027d gotten Jez\u0027s uncle Bracken, as well as the remnants of the gang out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof San Francisco, a city that was going to be bad for their health for a while. Morgead was trying to get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe gang to join Circle Daybreak for their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown good, and he said that Raven, at least, was showing some interest. Val and Thistle were being\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estubborn, but that was hardly surprising. What was important was that they were alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce, on the other hand, was simply gone. No one had seen a trace of him or Lily or any of her people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esince Jez blasted them. Apparently they had truly been vaporized, and Jez couldn\u0027t bring herself to feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoo badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All done!\" the nurse said brightly, straightening Jez\u0027s pajama top. Which was just as well because at that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoment a black head came poking in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is going on in here? You getting ready to go to the opera or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez raised her eyebrows at Morgead. \"Maybe. Are you telling me I can\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted and came in as the nurse went out \"I wouldn\u0027t dare tell you that. You\u0027re the princess, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can have anything.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jez said, with huge satisfaction. \"So how*re Hugh and Claire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire\u0027s fine; she fits right in with the witches here. I think she\u0027s trying to get them to put up a Web page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hugh\u0027s just his same stupid self. He\u0027s off saving chipmunks from toxic waste or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how about the kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kid,\" Morgead said, \"is living it up. The Day-breakers are crazy about her; something about one of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe oldest Old Souls ever found:-I dunno. Anyway,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey\u0027re trying to talk her mom into letting her live here. She says thanks for saving her life and she\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrawing you a picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez nodded, pleased. It would be nice if Iona came to live at the sanctuary; it meant Jez could see her a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elot. Not that Jez planned to live here all the time herself-she and Morgead needed their freedom. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t be penned in; they had to be able to come and go. She just hadn\u0027t gotten around to telling the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaybreakers that yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the people she loved taken care of, she could turn her attention to other matters. \"Is that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echocolate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only reason you like to see me, isn\u0027t it?\" Morgead said, allowing her to take the box. He sat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeside her, looking tragic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah,\" Jez said with her mouth full. She swallowed. \"Everybody brings \u0027em.\" Then she grinned. \"I like to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee you for a different reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned wickedly back. \"I can\u0027t think what that could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm... you\u0027re right... maybe there is no other reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch it, Jezebel,\" he growled and leaned forward menacingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me that, idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the idiot, idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re-\" But Jez never got to finish, because he stopped her mouth with a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his arms were around her-so gently- and the silver cord was humming and everything was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewarm and there were only the two of them in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne from the land of kings long forgotten; One from the hearth which still holds the spark; One from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay World where two eyes are watching; One from the twilight to be one with the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[The End] \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-18.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
