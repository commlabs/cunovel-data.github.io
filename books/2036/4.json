Let me do it alone,\" Meredith said, putting a hand on Bonnie\u0027s shoulder as they stood together in front of Caroline Forbes\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie started to lean into the pressure, but made herself stop. It was humiliating to be shaking so obviously on a Virginia morning in late July. It was humiliating to be treated like a child, too. But Meredith, who was only six months older, looked more adult than usual today. Her dark hair was pulled back, so that her eyes looked very large and her olive-skinned face with its high cheekbones was shown to its best advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could practically be my babysitter, Bonnie thought dejectedly. Meredith had high heels on, too, instead of her usual flats. Bonnie felt smaller and younger than ever in comparison. She ran a hand through her strawberry-blond curls, trying to fluff them up a precious half inch higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not scared. I\u0027m c-cold,\" Bonnie said with all the dignity she could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. You feel something coming from there, don\u0027t you?\" Meredith nodded at the house before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie looked sideways at it and then back at Meredith. Suddenly Meredith\u0027s adultness was more comforting than annoying. But before she looked at Caroline\u0027s house again she blurted, \"What\u0027s with the spike heels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Meredith said, glancing down. \"Just practical thinking. If anything tries to grab my ankle this time, it gets this.\" She stamped and there was a satisfying clack from the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie almost smiled. \"Did you bring your brass knuckles, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need them; I\u0027ll knock Caroline out again barehanded if she tries anything. But quit changing the subject. I can do this alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie finally let herself put her own small hand on Meredith\u0027s slim, long-fingered one. She squeezed. \"I know you can. But I\u0027m the one who should. It was me she invited over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Meredith said, with a slight, elegant curl of her lip. \"She\u0027s always known where to stick in the knife. Well, whatever happens, Caroline\u0027s brought it on herself. First we try to help her, for her sake and ours. Then we try to make her get help. After that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After that,\" Bonnie said sadly, \"there\u0027s no telling.\" She looked at Caroline\u0027s house again. It looked...skewed...in some way, as if she were seeing it through a distorting mirror. Besides that, it had a bad aura: black slashed across an ugly shade of gray-green. Bonnie had never seen a house with so much energy before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was cold, this energy, like the breath out of a meat locker. Bonnie felt as if it would suck out her own life-force and turn it into ice, if it got the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let Meredith ring the doorbell. It had a slight echo to it, and when Mrs. Forbes answered, her voice seemed to echo slightly, as well. The inside of the house still had that funhouse mirror look to it, Bonnie thought, but even stranger was the feel. If she shut her eyes she would imagine herself in a much larger place, where the floor slanted sharply down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came to see Caroline,\" Mrs. Forbes said. Her appearance shocked Bonnie. Caroline\u0027s mother looked like an old woman, with gray hair and a pinched white face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s up in her room. I\u0027ll show you,\" Caroline\u0027s mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Mrs. Forbes, we know where - \" Meredith broke off when Bonnie put a hand on her arm. The faded, shrunken woman was leading the way. She had almost no aura at all, Bonnie realized, and was stricken to the heart. She\u0027d known Caroline and her parents for so long - how could their relationships have come to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t call Caroline names, no matter what she does, Bonnie vowed silently. No matter what. Even...yes, even after what she\u0027s done to Matt. I\u0027ll try to remember something good about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was difficult to think at all in this house, much less to think of anything good. Bonnie knew the staircase was going up; she could see each step above her. But all her other senses told her she was going down. It was a horrifying feeling that made her dizzy: this sharp slant downward as she watched her feet climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a smell, strange and pungent, of rotten eggs. It was a reeking, rotten odor that you tasted in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline\u0027s door was shut, and in front of it, lying on the floor, was a plate of food with a fork and carving knife on it. Mrs. Forbes hurried ahead of Bonnie and Meredith and quickly snatched up the plate, opened the door opposite Caroline\u0027s, and placed it in there, shutting the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just before it disappeared, Bonnie thought she saw movement in the heap of food on the fine bone china.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll barely speak to me,\" Mrs. Forbes said in the same empty voice she\u0027d used before. \"But she did say that she was expecting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried past them, leaving them alone in the corridor. The smell of rotten eggs - no, of sulfur, Bonnie realized, was very strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSulfur - she recognized the smell from last year\u0027s chemistry class. But how did such a horrible smell get into Mrs. Forbes\u0027s elegant house? Bonnie turned to Meredith to ask, but Meredith was already shaking her head. Bonnie knew that expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie gulped, wiped her watering eyes, and watched Meredith turn the handle of Caroline\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was dark. Enough light shone from the hallway to show that Caroline\u0027s curtains had been reinforced by opaque bedspreads nailed over them. No one was in or on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in! And shut that door fast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Caroline\u0027s voice, with Caroline\u0027s typical waspishness. A flood of relief swept over Bonnie. The voice wasn\u0027t a male bass that shook the room, or a howl, it was Caroline-in-a-bad-mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped into the dimness before her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-shadow-souls-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-4.html","bookId":2036,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM"}
