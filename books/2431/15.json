He hatted and forced himself to stop making that infantile sound. He could feel himself trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said with infinite respect, \"Partner Elijah, it is a thunderstorm - expected - predicted - normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" whispered Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did know it. Thunderstorms had been described innumerable times in the books he had read, whether fiction or nonfiction. He had seen them in holographs and on hyperwave shows - sound, sight, and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real thing, however, the actual sound and sight, had never penetrated into the bowels of the City and he had never in his life actually experienced such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all he knew - intellectually - about thunderstorms, he could not face - viscerally - the actuality. Despite the descriptions, the collections of words, the sight in small pictures and in recordings on small screens, the sounds aptured despite all that, he had no idea the flashes were so bright and streaked so across the sky; that the sound was so vibratorily bass in sound when it rattled across a hollow world; that both were so sudden; and that rain could be so like an inverted bowl of water, endlessly pouring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe muttered in despair, \"I can\u0027t go out in that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t have to,\" said Daneel urgently. \"Giskard will get the airfoil. It will be brought right to the door for you. Not a drop of rain will fall on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not wait until it\u0027s over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely that would not be advisable, Partner Elijah. Some rain, at least, will continue past midnight and if the Chairman arrives tomorrow morning, as Dr. Amadiro implied he might, it might be wise to spend the evening in consultation with Dr. Fastolfe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley forced himself to turn around, face in the direction from which he wanted to flee, and look into Daneel\u0027s eyes. They seemed deeply concerned, but Baley thought dismally that that was merely the result of his own interpretation of the appearance of those eyes. The robot had no feelings, only positronic surges that mimicked those feelings. (And perhaps human beings had no feelings, only neuronic surges that were interpreted as feelings.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was somehow aware that Amadiro was gone. He said, \"Amadiro delayed me deliberately - by ushering me into the Personal, by his senseless talk, by his preventing you or Giskard from interrupting and warning me about the storm. He would even have tried to persuade me to tour the building or dine with him. He desisted only at the sound of the storm. That was what he was waiting for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would seem so. If the storm now keeps you here, that may be what he was waiting for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley drew a deep breath. \"You are right. I must leave somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, he took a step toward the door, which was still open, still filled with a dark gray vista of whipping rain. Another step. And still another - leaning heavily on Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard was waiting quietly at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley paused and closed his eyes for a moment. Then he said in a low voice, to himself rather than to Daneel, \"I must do it,\" and moved forward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e61\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well, sir?\" asked Giskard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a foolish question, dictated by the programming of the robot, thought Baley, though, at that, it was no worse than the questions asked by human beings, sometimes with wild inappropriateness, out of the programming, of etiquette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Baley in a voice he tried - and failed - to raise above a husky whisper. It was a useless answer to the foolish question, for Giskard, robot though he was, could surely see that Baley was unwell and that Baley\u0027s answer was a palpable lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was, however, given and accepted and that freed Giskard for the next step. He said, \"I will now leave to get the airfoil and bring it to the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it work - in all this - this water, Giskard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. This is not an uncommon rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left, moving steadily into the downpour. The lightning was flickering almost continuously and the thunder was a muted growl that rose to a louder crescendo every few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in his life, Baley found himself envying a robot. Imagine being able to walk through that; to be indifferent to water, to sight, to sound; to be able to, ignore surroundings and to have a pseudo-life that was absolutely courageous; to know no fear of pain or of death, because there was no pain or death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet to be incapable of originality of thought, to be incapable of unpredictable leaps of intuition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere such gifts worth what humanity paid for them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Baley could not say. He knew that, once he no longer felt terror, he would know that no price was too high to pay for being human. But now that he experienced nothing but the pounding of his heart and the collapse of his will, he could not help but wonder of what use it might be to be a human being if one could not overcome these deep-seated terrors, this intense agoraphobia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he had been in the open for much of two days and had managed to be almost comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fear had not been conquered. He knew that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had suppressed it by thinking intensely of other things, but the storm overrode all intensity of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not allow this. If all else failed - thought, pride, will - then he would have to fall back on shame. He could not collapse under the impersonal, superior gaze of the robots. Shame would have to be stronger than fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt Daneel\u0027s steady arm about his waist and shame prevented him from doing what, at the moment, he most wanted to do - to turn and hide his face against the robotic chest. He might have been unable to resist if Daneel had been human -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had lost contact with reality, for he was becoming aware of Daneel\u0027s voice as though it were reaching him from a long distance. It sounded as though Daneel was feeling something akin to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partner Elijah, do you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard\u0027s voice, from an equal distance, said, \"We must carry him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" mumbled Baley. \"Let me walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps they did not hear him. Perhaps he did not really speak, but merely thought he did. He felt himself lifted from the ground. His left arm dangled helplessly and he strove to lift it, to push it against someone\u0027s shoulder, to lift himself upright again from the waist, to grope for the floor with his feet and stand upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his left arm continued to dangle helplessly and his striving went for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was somehow aware that he was moving through the air and he felt a wash of spray against his face. Not actually water but the sifting of damp air. Then there was the pressure of a hard surface against his left side, a more resilient one against his right side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the airfoil, wedged in once more between Giskard and Daneel. What he was most conscious of was that Giskard was very wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a jet of warm air cascading over him. Between the near-darkness outside and the film of trickling water upon the glass, they might as well have been opacified - or so Baley thought till opacification actually took place and total darkness descended. The soft noise of the jet, as the airfoil rose above the grass and swayed, muted, the thunder and seemed to draw its teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"I regret the discomfort of my wet surface, Sir. I will dry quickly. We will wait here a short while till you recover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley was breathing more easily. He felt wonderfully and comfortably enclosed. He thought: Give me back my City. Wipe out all the Universe and let the Spacers colonize it. Earth is all we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even as he thought it, he knew it was his madness that believed it, not he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the need to keep his mind busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said weakly, \"Daneel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Partner Elijah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the Chairman. Is it your opinion that Amadiro was judging the situation correctly in supposing that the Chairman would put an end to the investigation or was he perhaps allowing his wishes to do his thinking for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may be, Partner Elijah, that the Chairman will indeed interview Dr. Fastolfe and Amadiro on the matter. It would be a standard procedure for settling a dispute - of this nature. There are ample precedents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" asked Baley weakly. \"If Amadiro was so persuasive, why should not the Chairman simply order the investigation stopped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Chairman,\" said Daneel, \"is in a difficult political situation. He agreed originally to allow you to be brought to Aurora at Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s urging and he cannot so sharply reverse himself so soon without making himself look weak and irresolute - and without angering, Dr. Fastolfe, who is still a very influential figure in the Legislature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did he not simply turn down Amadiro\u0027s request?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Amadiro is also influential, Partner Elijah, and likely to grow even more so. The Chairman must temporize by hearing both sides and by giving at least the appearance of deliberation, before coming to a decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Based on what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the merits of the case, we must presume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then by tomorrow morning, I must come up with something that will persuade the Chairman to side with Fastolfe, rather than against him. If I do that, will that mean victory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"The Chairman is not all-powerful, but his influence is great. If he comes out strongly on Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s side, then, under the present political conditions, Dr. Fastolfe will probably win the backing of the Legislature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley found himself beginning to think clearly again. \"That would seem explanation enough for Amadiro\u0027s attempt to delay us. He might have reasoned that I had nothing yet to offer the Chairman and he needed only to delay to keep me from getting anything in the time that remained to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he let me go only when he thought he could rely on the storm continuing to keep me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps so, Partner Elijah - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, we cannot allow the storm to stop us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said calmly, \"Where do you wish to be taken, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the establishment of Dr. Fastolfe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"May we have one moment\u0027s more pause, Partner Elijah? Do you plan to tell Dr. Fastolfe that you cannot continue the investigation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said sharply, \"Why do you say that?\" It was a measure of his recovery that his voice was loud and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"It is merely that I fear you might have forgotten for a moment that Dr. Amadiro urged you to do so for the sake of Earth\u0027s welfare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have not forgotten,\" said Baley grimly, \"and I am surprised, Daneel, that you should think that that would influence me. Fastolfe must be exonerated and Earth must send its settlers outward into the Galaxy. If there is danger in that from the Globalists, that danger must be chanced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, in that case, Partner Elijah, why go back to Dr. Fastolfe? It doesn\u0027t seem to me that we have anything of moment to report to him. Is there no direction in which we can further continue our investigation before reporting to Dr. Fastolfe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley sat up in his seat and placed his hand on Giskard, who was now entirely dry. He said, in quite a normal voice, \"I am satisfied with the progress I have already made, Daneel. Let\u0027s get moving, Giskard. Proceed to Fastolfe\u0027s establishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, tightening his fists and stiffening his body, Baley added, \"What\u0027s more, Giskard, clear the windows. I want to look out into the face of the storm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e62\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley held his breath in preparation for transparency. The small box of the airfoil would no longer be entirely enclosed; it would no longer have unbroken walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the windows clarified, there was a flash of light that came and went too quickly to do anything but darken the world by contrast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley could not prevent his cringe as be tried to steel himself for the thunder which, after a moment or two, rolled and grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said pacifyingly, \"The storm will get no worse and soon enough it will recede.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care whether it recedes or not,\" said Baley through, trembling lips. \"Come on. Let\u0027s go.\" He was trying, for his own sake, to maintain the illusion of a human being in charge of robots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfoil rose slightly in the air and at once underwent a sideways movement that tilted it so that Baley felt himself pushing hard against Giskard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley cried out (gasped out, rather), \"Straighten the vehicle, Giskard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel placed his arm around Baley\u0027s shoulder and pulled him gently back. His other arm was braced about a hand-grip attached to the frame of the airfoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That cannot be done, Partner Elijah,\" Daneel said. \"There is a fairly strong wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt his hair bristle. \"You mean - we\u0027re going to be blown away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not,\" said Daneel. \"If the car were antigrav form of technology that does not, of course, exist - and if its mass and inertia were eliminated, then it would be blown like a feather high into the air. However, we retain our full mass even when our jets lift us and poise us in the air, so our inertia resists the wind. Nevertheless, the wind makes us sway, even though the car remains completely under Giskard\u0027s control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t feel like it.\" Baley was conscious of a thin whine, which he imagined to be the wind curling around the body of the airfoil as it cut its way through the protesting atmosphere. Then the airfoil lurched and Baley, who could not for his life have helped it, seized Daneel in a desperate grip around the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel waited a moment. When Baley had caught his breath and his grip grew less rigid, Daneel released himself easily from the other\u0027s embrace, while somewhat tightening the pressure of his own arm around Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"In order to maintain course, Partner Elijah, Giskard must counter the wind by an asymmetric ordering of the airfoil\u0027s jets. They are sent to one side so as to cause the airfoil to lean into the wind and these jets have to be adjusted in force and direction as the wind itself changes force and direction. There are none better at this than Giskard, but, even so, there are occasional jiggles and lurches. You must excuse Giskard, then, if he does not participate in our conversation. His attention is fully on the airfoil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it - it safe?\" Baley left his stomach contract at the thought of playing with the wind in this fashion. He was devoutly glad he had not eaten for some hours. He could not - dared not - be sick in the close confines of the airfoil. The very thought unsettled him further and he tried to concentrate on something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of running the strips back on Earth, of racing from one moving strip to its neighboring faster strip, and, then to its neighboring still faster strip, and then back down into the slower regions, leaning expertly into the wind either way; in one direction as one fastered (an odd word used by no one but strip-racers) and in the other direction, as one slowered. In his younger days, Baley could do it without pause and without error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel had adjusted to the need without trouble and, the one time they had run the strips together, Daneel had done it perfectly. Well, this was just the same! The airfoil was running strips. Absolutely! It was the same!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot quite the same, to be sure. In the City, the speed of the strips was a fixed quantity. What wind there was blew in absolutely predictable fashion, since it was only the result of the movement of the strips. Here in the storm however, the wind had a mind of its own or, rather, it depended on so many variables (Baley was deliberately striving for rationality) that it seemed to have a mind of its own - and Giskard had to allow for that. That was all. Otherwise, it was just running the strips with an added complication. The strips were moving at variable - and sharply changing-speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley muttered, \"What if we blow into a tree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very unlikely, Partner Elijah. Giskard is far too skillful for that. And we are only very slightly above the ground, so that the jets are particularly powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll hit a rock. It will cave us in underneath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not hit a rock, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? How on Earth can Giskard see where he\u0027s going, anyway?\" Baley stared at the darkness ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is just about sunset,\" said Daneel, \"and some light is making its way through the clouds. It is - enough for us to see by with the help of our headlights. And as it grows darker, Giskard will brighten the headlights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What headlights?\" asked Baley rebelliously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not see them very well because they have a strong infrared component, to which Giskard\u0027s eyes are sensitive but yours are not. What\u0027s more, the infrared is more penetrating than shorter wave light is and, for that reason, is more effective in rain, mist, and fog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley managed to feel some curiosity, even amid his uneasiness. \"And your eyes, Daneel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My eyes, Partner Elijah, are designed to be as similar to those of human beings as possible. That is regrettable, perhaps, at this moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfoil trembled and Baley found himself holding his breath again. He said in a whisper, \"Spacer eyes are still adapted to Earth\u0027s sun, even if robot eyes aren\u0027t. A good thing, too, if it helps - remind them they\u0027re descended from Earthpeople.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice faded out. It was getting darker. He could see nothing at all now and the intermittent flashes lighted nothing, either. They were merely blinding. He closed his eyes and that didn\u0027t help. He was the more conscious of the angry, threatening thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould they not stop? Should they not wait for the worst of the storm to pass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard suddenly said, \"The vehicle is not reacting properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt the ride become ragged as though the machine was on wheels and was rolling over ridges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"Can it be storm damage, friend Giskard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does not have the feel of that, friend Daneel. Nor does it seem likely that this machine would suffer from this kind of damage in this or any other storm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley absorbed the exchange with difficulty. \"Damage?\" he muttered. \"What kind of damage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"I should judge the compressor to be leaking, sir, but slowly. It\u0027s not the result of an ordinary puncture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did it happen, then?\" Baley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deliberate damage, perhaps, while it was outside the Administration Building. I have known, now, for some little time that we are being followed and carefully not being overtaken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Giskard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A possibility, sir, is that they are waiting for us to break down completely.\" The airfoil\u0027s motion was becoming more ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you make it to Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would not seem so, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley tried to fling his reeling mind into action. \"In that case, I\u0027ve completely misjudged Amadiro\u0027s reason for delaying us. He was keeping us there to have one or more of his robots damage the airfoil in such a way as to bring us down in the midst of desolation and lightning,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why should he do that?\" said Daneel, sounding shocked. \"To get you? - In a way, he already had you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t want me. No one wants me,\" said Baley with a somewhat feeble anger. \"The danger is to you, Daneel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To me, Partner Elijah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you! Daneel. Giskard, choose a safe place to come down and, as, soon as you do, Daneel must get out of the car and be off to a place of safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"That is impossible, Partner Elijah. I could not leave you when you are feeling ill - and most especially if there are those who pursue us and might do you harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Daneel, they\u0027re pursuing you. You must leave. As for me, I will stay in the airfoil. I am in no danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please! Please! How can I explain the whole thing with everything spinning - Daneel\" - Baley\u0027s voice grew desperately calm - \"you are the most important individual here, far more important than Giskard and I put together. It\u0027s not just that I care for you and want no harm to come to you. All of humanity depends on you. Don\u0027t worry about me; I\u0027m one man; worry about billions. Daneel - please - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e63\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley could feel himself rocking back and forth. Or was it the airfoil? Was it breaking up altogether? Or was Giskard losing control? Or was he taking evasive action?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley didn\u0027t care. He didn\u0027t care! Let the airfoil crash. Let it smash to bits. He would welcome oblivion. Anything to get rid of this terrible fright, this total inability to come to terms with the Universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that he had to make sure that Daneel got away safely away. But how?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was unreal and he was not going to be able to explain anything to these robots. The situation was so clear to him, but how was he to transfer this understanding to these robots, to these nonmen, who understood nothing but their Three Laws and who would let all of Earth and, in the long run, all of humanity go to hell because they could only be concerned with the one man under their noses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had robots ever been invented?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, oddly enough, - Giskard, the lesser of the two, came to his aid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said in his contentless voice, \"Friend Daneel, I cannot keep this airfoil in motion much longer. Perhaps it will be more suitable to do as Mr. Baley suggests. He has given you a very strong order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I leave him when he is unwell, friend Giskard?\" said Daneel, perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot take him out into the storm with you, friend Daneel. Moreover, he seems so anxious for you to leave that it may do him harm for you to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt himself reviving. \"Yes - yes - \" he managed to croak out. \"As Giskard says. Giskard, you go with him, hide him, make sure he doesn\u0027t return - then come back for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said forcefully, \"That cannot be, Partner Elijah. We cannot leave you alone, untended, unguarded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No danger - I am in no danger. Do as I say - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"Those following are probably robots. Human beings I would hesitate to come out in the storm. And robots would not harm Mr. Baley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"They might take him away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not into the storm, friend Daneel, since that would work obvious harm to him. I will bring the airfoil to a halt now, friend Daneel. You must be ready to do as Mr. Baley orders. I, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good!\" whispered Baley. \"Good!\" He was grateful for the simpler brain that could more easily be impressed and that lacked the ability to get lost and uncertain in ever-expanding refinements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaguely, he thought of Daneel trapped between his perception of Baley\u0027s ill-being and the urgency of the order - and of his brain snapping under the conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley thought: No, no, Daneel. Just do as I say and don\u0027t question it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lacked the strength, almost the will, to articulate it and he let the order remain a thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfoil came down with a bump and a short, harsh, scraping noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors flew open, one on either side, and then closed with a soft, sighing noise. At once, the robots were gone. Having come to their decision, there was no hesitation and they moved with a speed that human beings could not duplicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley took a deep breath and shuddered. The airfoil was rock-steady now. It was part of the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suddenly aware of how much of his misery had been the result, of the swaying and bucking of the vehicle, the feeling of insubstantiality, of not being connected to the Universe but of being at the mercy of inanimate, uncaring forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, it was still and he opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not been aware that they had been closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still lightning on the horizon and the thunder was a subdued mutter, while the wind, meeting a more resistant and less yielding object now than it had hitherto, keened a higher note than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark. Baley\u0027s eyes were no more than - human and he saw no light of any kind, other than the occasional blip of lightning. The sun must surely have set and the clouds were thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the first time since Baley had left Earth, he was alone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e64\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been too ill, too beside himself, to make proper sense. Even now, he found himself struggling to understand what it was he should have done and would have done - if he had had room in his tottering mind for more than the one thought that Daneel must leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, he had not asked where he now was, what he was near, where Daneel and Giskard were planning to go. He did not know how any portion of the grounded airfoil worked. He could not, of course, make it move, but he might have had it supply heat if he felt cold or turn off the heat if there were too much - except that he did not know how to direct the machine to do either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know how to opacify the windows if he wanted to be enclosed or how to open a door if he wanted to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he could do now was to wait for Giskard to come back for him. Surely that was what Giskard would expect him to do. The orders to him had simply been: Come back for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no indication that Baley would change position in any way and Giskard\u0027s clear and uncluttered mind would surely interpret the \"Come back\" with the assumption that he was to come back to the airfoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley tried to adjust himself to that. In a way, it was a relief merely to wait, to have to make no decisions for a while, because there were no decisions he could possibly make. It was a relief to be steady and to feel at rest and to be rid of the terrible light flashes and the disturbing crashes of sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he might even allow himself to go to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he stiffened. - Dare he do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were being pursued. They were under observation. The airfoil, while parked and waiting for them outside the Administration Building of the Robotics Institute, had been tampered with and no doubt the tamperers would soon be upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was waiting for them, too, and not for Giskard only. Had he thought it out clearly in the midst of his misery?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machine had been tampered with outside the Administration Building. That might have been done by anyone, but most likely by someone who knew it was there - and who would know that better than Amadiro?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmadiro had intended delay until the storm. That was obvious. He was to travel in the storm and he was to break down in the storm. Amadiro had studied Earth and its population; he boasted of that. He would know quite clearly just what difficulty Earthpeople would have with the Outside generally and with a thunderstorm in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would be quite certain that Baley would be reduced to complete helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why should he want that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo bring Baley back to the Institute? He had already had him, but he had had a Baley in the full possession of his faculties and along with him he had had two robots perfectly capable of defending Baley physically. It would be different now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the airfoil were disabled in a storm, Baley would be disabled emotionally. He would even be unconscious, perhaps, and would certainly not be able to resist being brought back. Nor would the two robots object. With Baley clearly ill, their only appropriate reaction would be to assist Amadiro\u0027s robots in rescuing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the two robots would have to come along with Baley and would do so helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if anyone ever questioned Amadiro\u0027s action, he could say that he had feared for Baley in the storm; that he had tried to keep him at the Institute and failed; that he had sent his robots to trail him and assure his safety; and that, when the airfoil came to grief in the storm, those robots brought Baley back to haven. Unless people understood that it had been Amadiro who had ordered the airfoil tampered with (and who would believe that - and how could one prove it?), the only possible public reaction would be to praise Amadiro for his humanitarian feelings - all the more astonishing for having been expressed toward a subhuman Earthman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what would Amadiro do with Baley then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing, except to keep him quiet and helpless for a time. Baley was not himself the quarry. That was the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmadiro would also have two robots and they would now be helpless. Their instructions forced them, in the strongest manner, to guard Baley and, if Baley were ill and being cared for, they could only follow Amadiro\u0027s orders if those orders were clearly and apparently for Baley\u0027s benefit. Nor would Baley be (perhaps) sufficiently himself to protect them with further orders - certainly not if he were kept under sedation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear! It was clear! Amadiro had had Baley, Daneel, and Giskard - but in unusable fashion. He had sent them out into the storm in order to bring them back and have them again - in usable fashion. Especially Daneel! It was Daneel who was the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, Fastolfe would be searching for them eventually and would find them, too, and retrieve them, but by then it would be too late, wouldn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what did Amadiro want with Daneel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley, his head aching, was sure he knew - but how could he possibly prove it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could think no more. - If he could opacify the windows, he could make a little interior world again, enclosed and motionless, and then maybe he could continue his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not know how to opacify the windows. He could only sit there and look at the flagging storm beyond those windows, hear the whip of rain against the windows, watch the fading lightning, and listen to the muttering thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes tightly. The eyelids made a wall, too, but he dared not sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car door on his right opened. He heard the sighing noise it made. He felt the cool, damp breeze enter, the temperature drop, the sharp smell of things green and wet enter and drown, out the faint and friendly smell of oil and upholstery that reminded him somehow of the City that he wondered if he would ever see again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and there was the odd sensation of a robotic face staring at him - and drifting sideways, yet not really moving. Baley felt dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot, seen as a darker shadow against the darkness, seemed a large one. He had, somehow, an air of capability about him. He - said, \"Your pardon, sir. Did you not have the company of two robots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone,\" muttered Baley, acting as ill as he could and aware that it did not require acting. A brighter flash of the heavens made its way through the eyelids that were now half-open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone! Gone where, sir?\" And then, as he waited for an answer, he said, \"Are you ill, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt a distant twinge of satisfaction within the inner scrap of himself that was still capable of thinking. If the robot had been without special instruction, he would have responded to Baley\u0027s clear signs of illness before doing anything else. To have asked first about the robots implied hard and close-pressed directions as to their importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to assume a strength and normality he did not possess and said, \"I am well. Don\u0027t concern yourself with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could not possibly have convinced an ordinary robot, but this one had been so intensified in connection with Daneel, (obviously) that he accepted it - He said, \"Where have the robots gone, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the Robotics Institute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the Institute? Why, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were called by Master Roboticist Amadiro and he ordered them to return. I am waiting for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why did you not go with them, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master Roboticist Amadiro did not wish me to be exposed to the storm. He ordered me to wait here. I am following Master Roboticist Amadiro\u0027s orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped the repetition of the prestige-filled name with the inclusion of the honorific, together with the repetition of the word \"order,\" would have its effect on the robot and persuade him to leave Baley where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, if they had been instructed, with particular care, to bring back Daneel, and if they were convinced that Daneel was already on his way back to the Institute, there would be a decline in the intensity of their need in connection with that robot. They would have time to think of Baley again. They would say -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot said, \"But it appears you are not well, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt another twinge of satisfaction. He said, \"I am well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the robot, he could vaguely see a crowding of several other robots - he could not count them - with their faces gleaming in the occasional lightning flash. As Baley\u0027s eyes adapted to the return of darkness, he could see the dim shine of their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head. There were robots at the left door, too, though that remained closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many had Amadiro sent? Were they to have been returned, by force, if necessary?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Master Roboticist Amadiro\u0027s orders were that my robots were to return to the Institute and I was to wait. You see that they are returning and that I am waiting. If you were sent to help, if you have a vehicle, find the robots, who are on their way back, and transport them. This airfoil is no longer operative.\" He tried to say it all without hesitation and firmly, as a well man would. He did not entirely succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have returned on foot, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Find them. Your orders are clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was hesitation. Clear hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley finally remembered to move his right foot - he hoped properly. He should have done it before, but his physical body was not responding properly to his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill the robots hesitated and Baley grieved over that. He was not a Spacer. He did not know the proper words, the proper tone, the proper air with which to handle robots with the proper efficiency. A skilled roboticist could, with a gesture, a lift of an eyebrow, direct a robot as though it were a marionette of which he held the strings. - Especially if the robot were of his own design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Baley was only an Earthman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned - that was easy to do in his misery - and whispered a weary \"Go!\" and motioned with his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that added the last small and necessary quantity of weight to his order - or perhaps an end had simply been reached, to the time it took for the robots\u0027 positronic pathways to determine, by voltage and counter-voltage, how to sort out their instructions according to the Three Laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, they had made up their minds and, after that, there was no further hesitation. They moved back to their vehicle, whatever and wherever it was, with such determined speed that they seemed simply to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door the robot had held open now closed of its own accord. Baley had moved his foot in order to place it in the pathway of the closing door. He wondered distantly if his foot would be cut off cleanly or if its bones would be crushed, but he didn\u0027t move it. Surely no vehicle would be designed to make such a misadventure possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was alone again. He had forced robots to leave a patently unwell human being by playing on the force of the orders given them by a competent robot master who had been intent on strengthening the Second Law for his own purposes - and had done it to the point - where Baley\u0027s own quite apparent lies had subordinated the First Law to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow well he had done it, Baley thought with distant self-satisfaction - and became aware that the door which had swung shut was still ajar, held so by his foot, and that that foot had not been the least bit damaged as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e65\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt cool air curling about his foot and a sprinkle of cool water. It was a frighteningly abnormal thing to sense, yet he could not allow the door to close, for he would then not know how to open it. (How did the robots open those doors? Undoubtedly, it was no puzzle to members of the culture, but in his reading on Auroran life, there was no careful instruction of just how one opens the door of a standard airfoil. Everything of importance is taken for granted. You\u0027re supposed to know, even though you are, in theory, being informed.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was groping in his pockets as he thought this and even the pockets were not easy to find. They were not in the right places and they were sealed, so that they had to be opened by fumbles till he found the precise motion that caused the seal to part. He pulled out a handkerchief, balled it, and placed it between the door and jamb so that the door would not entirely close. He then removed his foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to think - if he could. There was no point to keeping the door open unless he meant to get out. Was there, however, any, purpose in getting out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he waited where he was, Giskard would eventually come back for him and, presumably, lead him to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDare he wait?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know how long it would take Giskard to see Daneel to safety and then return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut neither did he know how long it would take the pursuing robots to decide they would not find Daneel and Giskard on any road leading back to the Institute. (Surely it was impossible that Daneel and Giskard had actually moved backward toward the Institute in search of sanctuary. Baley had not actually ordered them not to - but what if that were the only feasible route? - No! Impossible!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley shook his head in silent denial of the possibility and felt it ache in response. He put his hands to it and gritted his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long would the pursuing robots continue to search before they would decide that Baley had misled them - or had been himself misled? Would they then return and take him in custody, very politely and with great care not to harm him? Could he hold them off by telling them he would die if exposed to the storm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould they believe that? Would they call the Institute to report? Surely they would do that. And would human beings then arrive? They would not be overly concerned about his welfare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Baley got out of the car and found some hiding place in the surrounding trees, it would be that much harder for the pursuing robots to locate him - and that would gain him time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would also be harder for Giskard to locate him, but Giskard would be under a much more intense instruction to guard Baley than the pursuing robots were to find him. The primary task of the former would be to locate Baley - and of the latter, to locate Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, Giskard was programmed by Fastolfe himself and Amadiro, however skillful, was no match for Fastolfe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely, then, all things being equal, Giskard would be back before the other robots could possibly be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut would all things be equal? With a faint attempt at cynicism, Baley thought: I\u0027m worn-out and can\u0027t really think. I\u0027m merely seizing desperately at whatever will console me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, what could he do but play the odds, as he conceived, the odds to be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned against the door and was out into the open. The handkerchief fell out into the wet, rank grass and he automatically bent down to pick it up, holding it in his hands as he staggered away from the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was overwhelmed by the gusts of rain that soaked his face and hands. After a short while, his wet clothes were clinging to his body and he was shivering with cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a piercing splitting of the sky - too quick, for him to close his eyes against - and then a sharp hammering that stiffened him in terror and made him clap his hands over his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the storm returned? Or did it sound louder only because he was out in the open?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to move. He had to move away from the car, so that the pursuers would not find him too easily. He must not waver and remain in its vicinity or he might as well have stayed inside - and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to wipe his face with the handkerchief, but it was as wet as his face was and he let it go. It was useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved on, hands outstretched. Was there a moon that circled Aurora? He seemed to recall there had been mention of such a thing and he would have welcomed its light. - But what did it matter? Even if it existed and were in the sky now, the clouds would obscure it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt something. He could not see what it was, but he knew it to be the rough bark of a tree. Undoubtedly a tree. Even a City man would know that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he remembered that lightning might hit trees and might kill people. He could not remember that he had ever read a description of how it felt to be hit by lightning or if there were any measures to prevent it. He knew of no one on Earth who had been hit by lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his way about the tree and was in an agony of apprehension and fear. How much was halfway around, so that he would end up moving in the same direction?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underbrush was thick now and hard to get through. It was like bony, clutching fingers holding him. He pulled petulantly and he heard the tearing of cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth were chattering and he was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother flash. Not a bad one. For a moment, he caught a glimpse of his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees! A number of them. He was in a grove of trees. Were many trees more dangerous than one tree where lightning was concerned?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it help if he didn\u0027t actually touch a tree?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know that, either. Death by lightning simply wasn\u0027t a factor in the Cities and the historical novels (and sometimes histories) that mentioned it never went into detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the dark sky and felt the wetness coming down. He wiped at his wet eyes with his wet hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled onward, trying to step high. At one point, he splashed through a narrow stream of water, sliding over the pebbles underlaying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strange! It made him no wetter than he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on again. The robots would not find him. Would Giskard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know where he was. Or where he was going. Or, how far he was from anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he wanted to return to the car, he couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was trying to find himself, he couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the storm would continue forever and he would finally dissolve and pour down in a little stream of Baley and no one would ever find him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his dissolved molecules would float down to the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there an ocean on Aurora?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course there was! It was larger than Earth\u0027s, but there was more ice at the Auroran poles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, he would float to the ice and freeze there, glistening in the cold orange sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were touching a tree again wet hands - wet tree - rumble of thunder - funny he didn\u0027t see the flash of lightning came first - was he hit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t feel anything - except the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground was under him because his fingers were scrabbling into cold mud. He turned his head so he could breathe. It was rather comfortable. He didn\u0027t have to walk anymore. He could wait. Giskard would find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suddenly very sure of it. Giskard would have to find him because -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he had forgotten the because. It was the second time he had forgotten something. Before he went to sleep - Was it the same thing he had forgotten each time? - The same thing - ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be all right - all -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he lay there, alone and unconscious, in the rain at the base of a tree, while the storm beat on. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-robots-of-dawn-robot-3/page-15.html","bookId":2431,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:24 PM"}
