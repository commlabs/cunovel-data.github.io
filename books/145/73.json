{"id":4310,"no":73,"title":"CHAPTER XXII.","content":"“But little the quiet to any ear,\n\u003cbr\u003e Of that night, or the sleep, to any eye.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord L. now arrived at Lodore-house. The dreadful intelligence was given, the notes shewn. He was stunned, it was entirely incredible. He roused himself, and was incensed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There could be no doubt that it was with Henry she had eloped, notwithstanding all her declarations of indifference towards him. These, it was now evident, had only been made to throw her friends off their guard, and gain time, till, by being of age, she was enabled to act in defiance of her father, without forfeiting her property.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [199]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While calling for his horses, he made some breathless inquiries among the servants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No one had seen Lady Julia come in, since she had walked out immediately after dinner. Alice had attended on that occasion with her walking things. She declared that the notes were not on the table, when her young Lady went out, and that the drawers which were now open and empty were then shut; and that the jewel-box, which was now gone, was then in one of the drawers, which she had opened to take out a pair of gloves, and afterwards locked again. It would thence appear, that Julia, or some one entrusted by her with her keys, must have returned privately, previous to her final departure, and taken away such of her clothes, trinkets, \u0026amp;c., as she wished to carry with her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord L. was now on horseback. Also Mr. Jackson, who, as usual on all emergencies, had been summoned.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795/59057.html","bookId":145,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:16:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:16:50 AM"}
