There were no striking incidents during this time, but in a quiet way Gerald had effected a good deal in the way of change and improvement. The house was provided with new comforts, a safe had been sent from Helena, in which Thomas Nixon kept securities and valuable papers, a good deal of correspondence was carried on, Gerald acting as private secretary. Meals were no longer sent in from the boarding-house, but a young Swedish woman was engaged as servant and housekeeper. In short, Mr. Nixon was beginning to live like other people. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To Gerald the most important event was the purchase of a horse for his use. At that time railroad facilities hardly existed in Campville, walking was difficult and fatiguing over the rough hills of Montana; and in traveling about for his employer Gerald found a horse of great service. He at any rate was in a position to contradict the statement that Thomas Nixon was a miser, for the old man repeatedly offered him money outside of his salary, but thus far Gerald had declined with thanks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One day Gerald brought back a letter from the morning mail, which Mr. Nixon read with thoughtful interest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I may have to send you on a journey, Gerald,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This letter is from the superintendent of a gold mine in Ransom, seventy-five miles from here.
