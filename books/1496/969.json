He almost looked like he had been fried to perfection by the tens of thousands of lightning bolts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, his cultivation base was no longer in the early Deva Realm… he had stepped into the mid Deva Realm!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis incomplete Sun-Moon Vast-Sky Incantation had reached its great circle. His left eye now had a bright moon in it that seemed ready to fly out of him at any moment, and appear in the sky as a second moon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manifestation of this divine ability would cause any ordinary person to feel as if their heart and mind were being replaced by a moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all it did to Bai Xiaochun was leave him trembling physically and mentally. The truth was that he normally wouldn’t ever use a method like this to achieve a cultivation base breakthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mere thought of being slammed by so much lightning struck terror into his heart….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m done with cultivation….” he said, scowling on the verge of tears. As of this point, even the slightest crackle of thunder caused him to flinch…. Right now, he couldn’t have been more afraid of another convergence of lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he looked around anxiously, and tried to decide whether or not to start moving around, a new lightning storm began to build up. Perhaps because of the influence of the previous convergence of lightning, the gravitational force generated this time was massive. Within moments, more lightning had built up than the last time, covering everything with sparkling brightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun screamed and scrambled backward, and yet that didn’t stop the lightning from descending toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t need it….” he shrieked. The Lightning Ancestor was long gone, huffing and puffing as he propelled his cell far off into the distance. Upon looking over his shoulder, he began to curse. “Dammit! No consideration for the elderly! Does he think it’s easy for me to move this cell at my age!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly before….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething big was happening outside in the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect. The black cloud that housed the Lightning Order was beginning to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost like an earthquake, something strong enough that all of the Lightning Order cultivators felt it immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did the ground just move?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no way. We’re on a big black cloud! How could that black cloud move…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you guys get the sense… that our Lightning Order’s lightning reserves seem low…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since Bai Xiaochun had been incarcerated, the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect had been oddly at peace. The Cloud Order cultivators had felt at ease from the beginning, whereas the Lightning Order cultivators had initially been worried. However, as time passed, they gradually calmed down as well. After all, everyone had complete and utter faith in Lightning Penitentiary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the devas felt no apprehension whatsoever. At long last, they were able to experience what life had been like before Bai Xiaochun arrived in their sect, and it left them sighing with heartfelt relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even as people sighed in contentment, the Lightning Order’s black cloud suddenly trembled, which immediately attracted attention. What was even more astonishing to the Lightning Order cultivators was how, moments later, the cloud shifted beneath their feet yet again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, muffled rumbling sounds could be heard, leading to cries of alarm within the Lightning Order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e move!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something’s wrong!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The lightning… guys, look at that lightning….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked down at the black cloud, and could see that fewer lightning bolts danced beneath its surface than before. Furthermore, every few moments, some of the remaining lightning bolts seemed to disappear into the depths of the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost immediately, ill premonitions rose up in the hearts of many Lightning Order disciples. Up in the black coffin high above, the devas’ expressions flickered, and they suddenly started to get very nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me it’s Bai Xiaochun again!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! It couldn’t possibly be him! He’s been locked up….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that the Lightning Order’s black cloud trembled yet again, even more violently than before. At the same time, loud rumbling sounds could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that exact same moment that, deep within the black cloud, in the middle of that massive convergence of lightning, Bai Xiaochun screamed and fled as quickly as possible. The restrictive spells that made up his 30-meter cell had long since been destroyed, giving him free access to attempt to escape. And yet, that did him no good. No longer were there tens of thousands of lightning bolts around him. Now, there were hundreds of thousands!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter where or how he fled, the lightning followed, and if he slowed down for even a moment, he would be enveloped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if he stopped moving, then even more lightning would build up. By this point, he was going crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could this be happening…?” he moaned. It was a moment of deep crisis, and therefore, he finally just gritted his teeth and said, “Dammit! Fine, I\u0027m going to go for broke. That lightning is made of spiritual energy, right? Who the hell would be scared of that!?!?” Letting out a roar to psyche himself up, he drew upon the mnemonic the Lightning Ancestor had taught him, and began to cultivate the Eleven Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformations!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly lurched to a halt, which instantly allowed tens of thousands of lightning bolts to hone in on him, then smash into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving his body slashed by lightning in this way was painful, but because of how tough he was, was easy to endure for the time being. At the same time, massive amounts of spiritual power began to flow through him, until he began to swell up like a balloon….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cloud Lightning Forefather, First Transformation!” His vision swam as he was wracked with pain, but he focused on the divine ability, using the spiritual energy to fuel the transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, rumbling sounds filled him as he grew to a height of 30 meters, and began to exude a wild and barbaric air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had already succeeded at the first transformation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut things weren’t over yet. As massive amounts of spiritual energy went wild within him, he began to work on the second transformation! Furthermore, he bolstered the effect with the Sun-Moon Vast-Sky Incantation, and the power of his left eye!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could only attempt a true combination by carefully analyzing everything one step at a time. Furthermore, there was always a chance of failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder normal circumstances, a failure would require him to stop and build up more spiritual energy before trying again. After all, combining these two powerful techniques demanded that he be in peak condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, with boundless amounts of spiritual energy at his disposal, he didn’t need to sit around waiting. As soon as he failed, he could try again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried again and again, over ten times, until suddenly his left eye began to shine with dazzling moonlight. As it did, his 30-meter-tall forefather form looked very different than Master Cloud Lightning’s had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn indescribable aura emanated out from him, and the moon sigil within his eyes shone with such powerful light that it seemed capable of controlling all of the darkness of the night!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It worked!” However, now was not the time to revel in excitement. The spiritual energy inside of him drained rapidly, almost beyond his control. Howling, he began the second transformation of the Cloud Lightning Forefather technique!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as he grew to a height of 60 meters! The second transformation… was a success!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, he was not finished. Next was the third transformation, and then the fourth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the innumerable lightning bolts surrounded him, rumbling sounds could be heard as he grew to a height of 90 meters, and then 120 meters!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the wild and barbaric aura of the technique, combined with a fleshly body that had mastered the Undying Bones, made his transformed form even more powerful. By now, he had surpassed the limits of fleshly body power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the twin Master Cloud Lightnings were here to see what was happening, they would be shocked to the core. After all, the power Bai Xiaochun was capable of with this transformation far surpassed them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was especially true because of the moon sigil in his left eye, which further added to his power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder normal circumstances, Bai Xiaochun would be very excited. But right now, he could tell that his body was reaching a limit in its ability to absorb the lightning from the black cloud. It had nothing to do with the divine ability, only his own body. In some ways, it was exactly the same as when consuming medicinal pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that critical point was reached, the lightning would no longer be nourishing, but instead, harmful, and even destructive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Bai Xiaochun grew stronger, the lightning bolts grew more numerous. By now, hundreds of thousands of them were showering down onto him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears of fear leaking out of his eyes, he decided that he had no choice but to hope that one more transformation would fix the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cloud Lightning Forefather, Fifth Transformation!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-966\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-968\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-967","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
