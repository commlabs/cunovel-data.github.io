Now, Mortal Sword, will you remove your weapons and let me rise?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I haven’t decided.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What must I promise? To leave Absi in your care? Will you guard his life, Mortal Sword?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious saw Gruntle hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I came to bargain with you all,’ Olar Ethil continued. ‘In faith. The undead ay was a slave to ancient memories, ancient betrayals. I will not hold it against any of you. Mortal Sword, look upon your friends – who among them is capable of protecting the children? You will not. The Trell waits only to hear my words whispering through his mind, and then he will quit your company. The Awl warrior is a pup, and a disrespectful one at that. The Jhag Bolead spawn is broken inside. I mean to bring to Onos Toolan his children—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s a T’lan Imass, isn’t he?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bonecaster was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the only way he would still serve you,’ Gruntle said. ‘He died, just as his daughters believed, and you resurrected him. Will you do the same to the boy? The gift of your deathly touch?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course not. He must live.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, and then said, ‘Because he is the hope of my people, Mortal Sword. I need him – for my army and for the First Sword who commands them. The child, Absi, shall be their cause, their reason to fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle, Precious saw, was suddenly pale. ‘A child? Their cause?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Their banner, yes. You do not understand – I cannot hold on to his anger … the First Sword’s. It is dark, a beast unchained, a leviathan – he must not be unleashed, not this way. Burn’s dream, Mortal Sword, let me rise!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle withdrew his weapons, stumbled back a step. He was muttering something under his breath. Precious Thimble caught only a few words. In the Daru tongue. ‘ The banner … child’s tunic, was that it? The colour … began red, ended … black .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlar Ethil struggled to her feet. Her face was barely recognizable, a crushed, splintered knot of bone and torn hide. The gouges from Baaljagg’s canines had scored deep, white grooves on her temples and the base of her mandible on both sides. The ruined shoulder slumped, its arm hanging useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gruntle backed still further, an anguished cry came from Setoc. ‘Has she won you all then? Will no one protect him? Please! Please! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twins were weeping. Absi was kneeling beside Baaljagg’s desiccated body, moaning in a strange cadence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCartographer clattered closer to the boy, one foot blackened and smouldering. ‘Make him stop that. Someone. Make him stop that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious frowned, but the others ignored the undead man’s pleas. What does he mean by that? She turned to Olar Ethil. ‘Bonecaster—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘East, woman. That is where you will find all you need. I have touched your soul. I have made it into a Mahybe, a vessel that waits. East.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious Thimble crossed her arms, eyes closing for a moment. She wanted to look at Faint and Sweetest, to see the satisfaction, the relief, in their eyes. She wanted to, but knew she would see nothing of the sort, not from those two. They were women, after all, and three children were being surrendered. Thrown into undead arms. They will thank me in the end. When the memory of this moment fades, when we are all safe and home again .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell … not all of us. But what can we do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetoc, with Torrent at her side, was all that stood between Olar Ethil and the three children. Tears streamed down Setoc’s cheeks, and in the Awl warrior’s stance Precious Thimble saw a man facing his execution. He’d drawn his sabre, but the look in his eyes was bleak. Yet he did not waver. Among them all, this young warrior was the only one not to turn away. Damn you, Setoc, will you see this brave boy die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We can’t stop her,’ Precious said to Setoc. ‘You must see that. Torrent – tell her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I gave up the last of the Awl children to the Barghast,’ said Torrent. ‘And now they are all dead. Gone.’ He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you protect these ones any better?’ Precious demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if he’d been slapped. He looked away. ‘Giving up children is the one thing I seem to do well.’ He sheathed his weapon and grasped Setoc’s upper arm. ‘Come with me. We will talk where no one else can hear us.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-24.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
