But you slow down, girl, hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, Augie. Thanks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away from the curb at a sedate speed, then glanced in the rearview mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugie was still standing beside his police car, watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of exasperation, she kept to the speed limit the rest of the way to church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was driving home an hour later when she saw Tom Duncan walking down the street. She had a date with him tonight. How could she have forgotten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling over to the curb, she honked her horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked her way, frowning, then smiled when he recognized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki rolled the window down. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Hi yourself. What are you doing out and about so early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why weren\u0027t you at Mass this fine morning?\" she asked, then blushed. Just because be wore a cross didn\u0027t necessarily mean he was Catholic, and even if he was Catholic, that didn\u0027t mean he was in the habit of going to church. \"I\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s none of my business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan laughed. \"Don\u0027t worry. My soul\u0027s in pretty good shape. I\u0027ve relied on heavenly intervention far too often to turn my back on the church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faith comes in handy in my line of work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never thought of that, but I\u0027ll bet it does. Is there good money in bounty hunting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes. Depends on who you\u0027re hunting and how bad your client wants him caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean someone is paying you to hunt for Sharlene\u0027s murderer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. This time it\u0027s on me.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Listen, I\u0027ve got some business to take care of. Are we still on for tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded. \"Sure. See you at six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a wave, he continued on down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki was on her way home when she saw Mrs. Heath outside watering her lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter parking the car, Vicki got out and walked up the narrow path. \"Morning, Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Victoria, dear,\" the older woman said, looking up from beneath the brim of a wide straw hat. \"How nice to see you in one piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki frowned. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you earlier. You were driving your machine way too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Vicki said with a wry grin. \"Augie thought so, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear, I hope that old fool didn\u0027t give you a ticket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s good, though you really should slow down. So, how are you, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. And guess what?\" Vicki could hardly wait to see the expression on Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeath\u0027s face when she told her about Duncan. \"I have a date tonight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Heath stared at her in what could only be described as alarm. \"He doesn\u0027t have rusty yellow eyes, does he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the warmth of the sun, Vicki felt a sudden chill crawl over her skin. \"Yellow eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Heath placed her hand on Vicki\u0027s arm. \"I saw him in a dream, dear. A horrid man with yellow eyes. He was knocking at your door.\" Her hand tightened on Vicki\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you do, you must not let him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki shivered. \"No. No, I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a smile, Mrs. Heath released her hold on Vicki\u0027s arm, then turned off the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a good time, dear. And tell me, who\u0027s the lucky young man? Is it someone I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s new in town. I met him at the diner a few days ago. His name is Tom Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Heath\u0027s eyes widened. \" Duncan? Did you say Tom Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Do you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing one hand to her heart, Mrs. Heath sat down on the wrought-iron bench located in the midst of her garden. \"Forgive me, dear, the name just took me by surprise, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know Mr. Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dated a man by the name of Thomas Duncan years ago, before I met Mr. Heath. I might have married him, if he didn\u0027t have such a dreadful occupation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreadful in what way?\" Vicki asked. The only dreadful occupation she could think of was being a mortician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a vampire hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling as though the earth had suddenly stopped spinning, Vicki stared at Mrs. Heath, and then she laughed. \"You really had me going for a minute there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no laughing matter, dear. It\u0027s hard to believe that they exist in this day and age, but they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stared at the elderly woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" Mrs. Heath said. \"I didn\u0027t believe my Thomas when he told me, either, but then one night I saw one.\" She stared into the distance. \"He tried to kill me. I\u0027ll never forget the sight of that creature, his eyes glowing like a wildcat\u0027s, his fangs coming toward me. It was Thomas who saved my life. I was young back then and easily frightened. When Thomas asked me to marry him, I ran away. Sometimes I wonder…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter. What does your Mr. Duncan do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a bounty hunter. People,\" she clarified, \"not vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Heath patted Vicki\u0027s hand in motherly fashion. \"Run along and have a good time, dear. It\u0027s time for my nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, Vicki returned to her car. Maybe Mrs. Heath was losing it. Vampires, indeed. They were the stuff of myth and legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter parking the car, she picked up the newspaper and carried it into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping it on the kitchen table, she fixed herself a bowl of cereal and some toast and then sat down to read the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne look at the headlines and she forgot all about eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOURTH WOMAN FOUND DEAD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBODY DRAINED OF BLOOD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickly read the story. The body had been found in a vacant lot in Woods Hollow by a late-night jogger. There was no evidence of foul play. The police were certain that the murderer was the same person who had killed the three women in Pear Blossom Creek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBodies drained of blood… She shook her head, dismayed by the turn of her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no such thing as vampires. She repeated the words aloud, hoping that it would somehow reassure her, but it didn\u0027t. Vampires or not, someone was killing women and draining them of blood. Perhaps a Satanic cult was behind the murders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t they use blood in their rituals? But good Lord, how much blood did one cult need?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poured her breakfast down the garbage disposal, changed into a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, and went into the den to clean the aquarium. And all the while she thought about Tom Duncan and vampires. Of course, she knew there were stories and legends from ancient times, when anything that could not be explained logically was ascribed to something mystical or magical, like vampires or witches. In olden times, people believed that a moved or fallen tombstone, horses shying away from a grave, or footprints leading away from a grave were indications of a vampire\u0027s resting place. People with pale skin and long nails, or those who had no appetite and an aversion to bright lights, were also suspected of being vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers who might be accused of being vampires were those who were never seen during the day or who were reluctant to enter a house without an invitation. Vicki frowned. She had never seen Antonio during the day. He always waited to be invited into her house. She had never seen him eat…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki shook her head in exasperation. She was becoming obsessed with the Undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampires, indeed. Serial killers often behaved in ghoulish ways. That didn\u0027t mean this one was a vampire. Serial killers often killed their victims in bizarre ways, or kept body parts for souvenirs, or collected personal items. This particular killer liked to drain his victims of blood and take a lock of their hair. That didn\u0027t mean he drank the blood, but what did he do with it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered watching a special about vampires and those suspected of being vampires back when she viewed the existence of such things as an interesting myth and not a possible reality. One such, Elizabeth Bathory, had murdered hundreds of young girls and bathed in their blood, believing it would keep her young and beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, the truth of what she was doing became known and she was walled up in her bedroom, where she died four years later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" Going outside, Vicki lifted her face to the sun, letting its warmth wash over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took several deep breaths, clearing her mind of all her ghastly thoughts. Even if there were vampires, and she wasn\u0027t ready to admit such a thing, she was safe now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent the next hour and a half working in the yard. She raked the leaves from the lawn, both front and back, pulled some weeds, and watered the grass, thinking she would have to mow it soon. Thinking how nice it would be to have a husband and children to help with the yard work. For a moment, she imagined her husband teaching their son how to mow the grass while she and their daughter worked in the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, they would sit in the shade and drink lemonade and then go for a walk in the woods, or go down to the lake for a swim… It came as no surprise that the husband of her dreams looked a lot like Antonio Battista.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the house, she put an Elvis CD in the stereo, made a cake and put it in the oven, and then fixed a quick sandwich for lunch. When she finished eating, she rolled up her sleeves and mopped the floors in the kitchen and bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still, thoughts of vampires and bloodred moons crept into her thoughts. She recalled what Mrs. Heath had said and wondered if Tom Duncan was related to the Duncan that Mrs. Heath had known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to ask Tom about it when she saw him tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the cake out of the oven, changed the sheets on her bed, then frosted the cake, and before she knew it, it was time to get ready for her date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on Vicki Cavendish\u0027s front porch, Tom Duncan straightened his tie, brushed a piece of lint off his trousers, and blew out a deep breath. He couldn\u0027t remember the last time he had been out with a woman. Hell, he wasn\u0027t sure he even remembered how to act on a date! He spent most of his life prowling around dilapidated houses or crawling around in caves and cemeteries. Hardly the kinds of places where a man was likely to meet a woman he\u0027d want to take out. Then, too, he rarely stayed in one place long enough to get acquainted with very many women, let alone establish any kind of relationship. Of course, he might be here in Pear Blossom Creek for quite some time, since he hadn\u0027t found a single clue as to where his prey was hiding. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-13.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
