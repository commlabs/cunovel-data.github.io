The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his heir .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are several tangential possibilities,\" Piter said. \"I indicate that House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Duke\u0027s too proud a man for that,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a possibility,\" Piter said. \"The ultimate effect for us would be the same, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it would not!\" the Baron growled. \"I must have him dead and his line ended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the high probability,\" Piter said. \"There are certain preparations that indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none of these things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" the Baron sighed. \"Get on with it, Piter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At Arrakeen,\" Piter said, \"the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Ambassador to the Smugglers,\" the Baron chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambassador to what?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your uncle makes a joke,\" Piter said. \"He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor\u0027s interest in smuggling operations on Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be dense, Feyd,\" the Baron snapped. \"As long as the Guild remains effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could spies and assassins move about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha\u0027s mouth made a soundless \"Oh-h-h-h.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve arranged diversions at the Residency,\" Piter said. \"There\u0027ll be an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir - an attempt which could succeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piter,\" the Baron rumbled, \"you indicated - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I indicated accidents can happen,\" Piter said. \"And the attempt must appear valid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,\" the Baron said. \"Of course, he\u0027s potentially more dangerous than the father . . . with that witch mother training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,\" Piter said. \"The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial Conditioning - supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It\u0027s assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew you couldn\u0027t subvert Imperial Conditioning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another time,\" the Baron said. \"Continue, Piter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In place of Yueh,\" Piter said, \"we\u0027ll drag a most interesting suspect across Hawat\u0027s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to Hawat\u0027s attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lady Jessica herself,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it not sublime?\" Piter asked. \"Hawat\u0027s mind will be so filled with this prospect it\u0027ll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.\" Piter frowned, then: \"But I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be able to carry it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want him to, eh?\" the Baron asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t distract me,\" Piter said. \"While Hawat\u0027s occupied with the Lady Jessica, we\u0027ll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he\u0027s gaining a measure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we\u0027ll signal Yueh and move in with our major force . . . ah . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, tell him all of it,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in Harkonnen livery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sardaukar!\" Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see how I trust you, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"No hint of this must ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial House and there\u0027d be chaos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The main point,\" Piter said, \"is this: since House Harkonnen is being used to do the Imperial dirty work, we\u0027ve gained a true advantage. It\u0027s a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we\u0027ll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company\u0027s coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships - they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Duke Leto,\" Piter said, \"may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert\u0027s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty\u0027s agents - the planetary ecologist. You may remember him - Kynes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feyd remembers him,\" the Baron said. \"Get on with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not drool very prettily, Baron,\" Piter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on with it, I command you!\" the Baron roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiter shrugged. \"If matters go as planned,\" he said, \"House Harkonnen will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More profits,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" the Baron said. And he thought: It\u0027s only just. We\u0027re the ones who tamed Arrakis . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,\" Piter said. \"They will know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will know,\" the Baron breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loveliest of all,\" Piter said, \"is that the Duke will know, too. He knows now. He can already feel the trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true the Duke knows,\" the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. \"He could not help but know . . . more\u0027s the pity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension - grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am hungry,\" the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. \"Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: \"The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"Muad\u0027Dib, Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Jessica, what have you to say for yourself?\" asked the Reverend Mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul\u0027s ordeal. The two women were alone in Jessica\u0027s morning room while Paul waited in the adjoining soundproofed Meditation Chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the evening\u0027s banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not hear the Reverend Mother\u0027s question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been another ordeal once - so many years ago. A skinny girl with hair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had entered the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at her right hand, flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Paul,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you a question, Jessica!\" The old woman\u0027s voice was snappish, demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh . . . \" Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the Reverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west windows. \"What do you want me to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?\" The old voice carried a tone of cruel mimicry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I had a son!\" Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into this anger deliberately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It meant so much to him,\" Jessica pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica lifted her chin. \"I sensed the possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought only of your Duke\u0027s desire for a son,\" the old woman snapped. \"And his desires don\u0027t figure in this. An Atreides daughter could\u0027ve been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You\u0027ve hopelessly complicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not infallible,\" Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the old eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, the old woman muttered: \"What\u0027s done is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I vowed never to regret my decision,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How noble,\" the Reverend Mother sneered. \"No regrets. We shall see when you\u0027re a fugitive with a price on your head and every man\u0027s hand turned against you to seek your life and the life of your son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica paled. \"Is there no alternative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see in the future what I\u0027ve seen in the past. You well know the pattern of our affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of its heredity. It\u0027s in the bloodstream - the urge to mingle genetic strains without plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CHOAM,\" Jessica muttered. \"I suppose it\u0027s already decided how they\u0027ll redivide the spoils of Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times,\" the old woman said. \"The Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent of the CHOAM directorship\u0027s votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely as others smell those same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the pattern of history, girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s certainly what I need right now,\" Jessica said. \"A review of history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surround us. We\u0027ve a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures. It\u0027d be bad enough without the complication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica spoke bitterly: \"Chips in the path of the flood - and this chip here, this is the Duke Leto, and this one\u0027s his son, and this one\u0027s - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate edge you walked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,\u0027 \" Jessica quoted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truth.\" the old woman said. \"And all we can hope for now is to prevent this from erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the key bloodlines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She fought down the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the ragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, \"I\u0027ll pay for my own mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your son will pay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll shield him as well as I\u0027m able.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shield!\" the old woman snapped. \"You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he\u0027ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. \"Is it really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there and softened it up somewhat.\" The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her feet, straightened a fold in her gown. \"Call the boy in here. I must be leaving soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman\u0027s voice softened. \"Jessica, girl, I wish I could stand in your place and take your sufferings.

But kindness forces me to tell you there\u0027s little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit Totality. You mustn\u0027t let yourself hope too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture. \"You make me feel like a little girl again - reciting my first lesson.\" She forced the words out: \" \u0027Humans must never submit to animals.\u0027 \" A dry sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: \"I\u0027ve been so lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It should be one of the tests,\" the old woman said. \"Humans are almost always lonely. Now summon the boy. He\u0027s had a long, frightening day. But he\u0027s had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions about these dreams of his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it. \"Paul, come in now, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though she were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the Reverend Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal. He heard his mother close the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young man,\" the old woman said, \"let\u0027s return to this dream business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you dream every night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not dreams worth remembering.

Was it worth remembering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Paul closed his eyes. \"I dreamed a cavern . . . and water . . . and a girl there - very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in them. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on Caladan.\" Paul opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul thought about this, then: \"Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a stamp of strangeness on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stamp of strangeness,\" the old woman breathed, and again she shot a glance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. \"Tell me truly now, Paul, do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And I\u0027ve dreamed about that girl before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? You know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will know her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Paul closed his eyes. \"We\u0027re in a little place in some rocks where it\u0027s sheltered.

And she\u0027s frightened but trying to hide it from me, and I\u0027m excited. And she says: \u0027Tell me about the waters of your homeworld, Usul.\u0027 \" Paul opened his eyes. \"Isn\u0027t that strange? My homeworld\u0027s Caladan. I\u0027ve never even heard of a planet called Usul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there more to this dream?\" Jessica prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But maybe she was calling me Usul,\" Paul said. \"I just thought of that.\" Again, he closed his eyes. \"She asks me to tell her about the waters. And I take her hand. And I say I\u0027ll tell her a poem. And I tell her the poem, but I have to explain some of the words - like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What poem?\" the Reverend Mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul opened his eyes. \"It\u0027s just one of Gurney Halleck\u0027s tone poems for sad times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Paul Jessica began to recite:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember salt smoke from a beach fire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd shadows under the pines -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolid, clean . . . fixed -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeagulls perched at the tip of land,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite upon green . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a wind comes through the pines\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo sway the shadows;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seagulls spread their wings,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLift\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd fill the sky with screeches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I hear the wind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing across our beach,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the surf,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I see that our fire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHas scorched the seaweed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the one,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman stared at Paul, then: \"Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene Gesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of us. Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a mother. Possibility I see, too, but no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, she said: \"As you will, then.

She doesn\u0027t really know anything . And he said: \"Hint then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And be damned to me?\" She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old face. \"Very well: \u0027That which submits rules.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as tension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a hint?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning,\" the old woman said. \"The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows - a wall against the wind. This is the willow\u0027s purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him, reinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her: fatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach,\" he said. \"You talk about me, but you haven\u0027t said one thing about what we can do to help my father.

Doubtful, but possible. But for your father, nothing. When you\u0027ve learned to accept that as a fact, you\u0027ve learned a real Bene Gesserit lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His mind seethed with resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. \"You\u0027ve been training him in the Way - I\u0027ve seen the signs of it. I\u0027d have done the same in your shoes and devil take the Rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, I caution you,\" said the old woman, \"to ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, but we both know how much more he needs . . . and that desperately.\" She stepped close to Paul, stared down at him. \"Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it. But if you don\u0027t - well, we shall yet succeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed between them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing, with not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother\u0027s face as she turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have read that Muad\u0027Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad\u0027Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney\u0027s songs, as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- of course\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- the Duke Leto, whose qualities as a father have long been overlooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"A Child\u0027s History of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThufir Hawat slipped into the training room of Castle Caladan, closed the door softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm-leathered. His left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of the Old Duke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree generations of them now , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through the skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to a door? Hawat cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul remained bent over his studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul straightened, spoke without turning: \"I know. I\u0027m sitting with my back to a door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table. Hawat\u0027s eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you coming down the hall,\" Paul said. \"And I heard you open the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sounds I make could be imitated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d know the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might at that , Hawat thought. That witch-mother of his is giving him the deep training, certainly. I wonder what her precious school thinks of that? Maybe that\u0027s why they sent the old Proctor here - to whip our dear Lady Jessica into line .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere stand I , Hawat thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thufir, what\u0027re you thinking?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat looked at the boy. \"I was thinking we\u0027ll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that make you sad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.\" He glanced at the charts on the table. \" And Arrakis is just another place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did my father send you up to test me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat scowled - the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded. \"You\u0027re thinking it\u0027d have been nicer if he\u0027d come up himself, but you must know how busy he is. He\u0027ll be along later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The storms. I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They sound pretty bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s too cautious a word: bad . Those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push - coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose that\u0027s in their way - sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t they have weather control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there\u0027d be maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your father\u0027s House isn\u0027t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever seen the Fremen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lad\u0027s mind is darting all over today , Hawat thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like as not I have seen them,\" he said. \"There\u0027s little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And they stink to heaven in any closed space. It\u0027s from those suits they wear - call them \u0027stillsuits\u0027 - that reclaim the body\u0027s own water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. \"Water\u0027s precious there,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I\u0027m doing it, getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy. It\u0027s madness to go in there without that caution in our minds .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. \"Water,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll learn a great concern for water,\" Hawat said. \"As the Duke\u0027s son you\u0027ll never want for it, but you\u0027ll see the pressures of thirst all around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water starvation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll learn about the funeral plains,\" she\u0027d said, \"about the wilderness that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the sandworms. You\u0027ll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You\u0027ll ride upon your own two feet without \u0027thopter or groundcar or mount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone - singsong and wavering - than by her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you live upon Arrakis,\" she had said, \"khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: \"Do you see no hope. Your Reverence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for the father.\" And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. \"Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things . . .\" She held up four big-knuckled fingers. \". . . the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing . . .\" She closed her fingers into a fist. \". . . without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat\u0027s puzzled frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you woolgathering that time?\" Hawat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you meet the Reverend Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?\" Hawat\u0027s eyes quickened with interest. \"I met her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She . . .\" Paul hesitated, found that he couldn\u0027t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? What did she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul took two deep breaths. \"She said a thing.\" He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman\u0027s tone: \" \u0027You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It\u0027s something none of your ancestors learned\u0027.\" Paul opened his eyes, said: \"That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, \u0027He\u0027s losing it.\u0027 And I said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said. \u0027He\u0027ll lose that one, too.\u0027 And I wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he\u0027d already been warned - by you, by Mother, by many people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough,\" Hawat muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why\u0027re we going?\" Paul demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there\u0027s hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me , he thought. How?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,\" Paul said. \"And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit a mark there right enough , Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?\" Hawat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul shrugged. \"Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world\u0027s language, that it\u0027s different for every world. And I thought she meant they didn\u0027t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn\u0027t it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don\u0027t hear just with your ears. And I said that\u0027s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat chuckled. \"How\u0027d that sit with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn\u0027t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: \u0027A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\u0027 That seemed to satisfy her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seems to be getting over it , Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thufir,\" Paul said, \"will Arrakis be as bad as she said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing could be that bad,\" Hawat said and forced a smile. \"Take those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, I can tell you there\u0027re many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and . . .\" Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. \". . . they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father\u0027s helper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,\" Paul said. \"Do you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis . . . perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,\" Hawat said. \"Only what it was like long ago . . . mostly. But what is known - you\u0027re right on that score.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will the Fremen help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a possibility.\" Hawat stood up. \"I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who\u0027s fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It\u0027s not that I think there\u0027s any danger in the castle; it\u0027s just a habit I want you to form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul got to his feet, moved around the table. \"You\u0027re going today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today it is, and you\u0027ll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it\u0027ll be on the soil of your new world.\" He gripped Paul\u0027s right arm at the bicep. \"Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.\" He released the arm, patted Paul\u0027s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thufir! \"Paul called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sit with your back to any doors,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin spread across the seamed old face. \"That I won\u0027t, lad. Depend on it.\" And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day here , he thought. He looked around the room. We\u0027re leaving . The idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things - the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns - the unknown sum called nature , a vague summation without any sense of the now . And he wondered: What is the now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Gurney Halleck,\" Paul called, \"are you the new weapons master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck kicked the door shut with one heel. \"You\u0027d rather I came to play games, I know,\" he said. He glanced around the room, noting that Hawat\u0027s men already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke\u0027s heir. The subtle code signs were all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung over Gurney\u0027s shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up - the rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,\" Halleck said. \"And what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemy\u0027s funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul grinned. Of all his father\u0027s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew the man\u0027s moods and deviltry, his humors , and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. \"If y\u0027 won\u0027t talk, y\u0027 won\u0027t,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: \"Well, Gurney, do we come prepared for music when it\u0027s fighting time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s sass for our elders today,\" Halleck said. He tried a chord on the instrument, nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Duncan Idaho?\" Paul asked. \"Isn\u0027t he supposed to be teaching me weaponry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Duncan \u0027s gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,\" Halleck said. \"All you have left is poor Gurney who\u0027s fresh out of fight and spoiling for music.\" He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. \"And it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we\u0027d best teach you the music trade so\u0027s you won\u0027t waste your life entire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027d better sing me a lay then,\" Paul said. \"I want to be sure how not to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-h-h, hah!\" Gurney laughed, and he swung into \"Galacian Girls.\" his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill do it for pearls,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Arrakeen for water!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you desire dames\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike consuming flames,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry a Caladanin daughter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick,\" Paul said, \"but if my mother heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she\u0027d have your ears on the outer wall for decoration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGurney pulled at his left ear. \"Poor decoration, too, they having been bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced some strange ditties on his baliset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve forgotten what it\u0027s like to find sand in your bed,\" Paul said. He pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. \"Then, let\u0027s fight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck\u0027s eyes went wide in mock surprise. \"So! It was your wicked hand did that deed! Guard yourself today, young master - guard yourself.\" He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. \"I\u0027m a hellfiend out for revenge!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile , one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,\" Paul intoned. \"This doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded.\" Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. \"In shield fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack,\" Paul said. \"Attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!\" Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed to enter a shield\u0027s mindless defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest. \"Speed, excellent,\" he said. \"But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stepped back, chagrined. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-2.html","bookId":2153,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:41 PM"}
