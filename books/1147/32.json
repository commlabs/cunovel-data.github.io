{"id":44797,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII.--IN THE TRENCHES.","content":"It was while the infantry and Naval Brigade were still before Sebastopol, toiling, trenching, and pounding with cannon and mortar at all its southern side, we had our ardour fired, our enthusiasm kindled, and our sorrow keenly excited by the tidings of that glorious but terrible death ride, the charge of the six hundred cavalry at Balaclava; and of how only one hundred and fifty came alive out of that mouth of fire, the valley where rained \"the red artillery\"--the 13th Hussars were said to have brought only twelve men out of the action, and the 17th Lancers twenty--and how nobly they were avenged by our \"heavies\" under the gallant Scarlett; and of the stern stand made against six thousand Russian horse by the \"thin red line\" of the Sutherland Highlanders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the day these tidings were circulated in the trenches by many who had witnessed the events, we seemed to redouble our energies, and shot and shell were poured with greater fury than ever on the city, while sharper, nearer, and more deadly were the contests of man and man in the rifle-pits between it and the trenches. Then followed the sortie made by Menschikoff, supposing that most of the allied forces had been drawn towards Balaclava--a movement met by the infantry and artillery of the second division under Sir De Lacy Evans, and repulsed with a slaughter which naturally added to the hatred on both sides; and innumerable were the stories told, and authenticated, of the Russians murdering our helpless wounded in cold blood. On the night of the 2nd November I was again in the trenches opposite to the eastern flank of Sebastopol, the whole regiment being on duty covering the batteries and working-parties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The day passed as usual in exciting and desultory firing, the Russians and our fellows watching each other like lynxes, and never missing an opportunity for taking a quiet shot at each other. A strong battalion of the former was in our front, lurking among some mounds and thick abattis, formed of trees felled and pegged to the earth with their branches towards us; and above the barrier and the broken ground that lay between it and the advanced trench-ground, strewed with fragments of rusty iron nails, broken bottles, and the other amiable contents of exploded bombs, torn, rent, upheaved, or sunk into deep holes by the explosion of mines and countermines, shells and rockets, we could see their bearded visages, their flat caps and tall figures, cross-belted and clad in long gray shapeless coats, as from time to time they yelled and started up to take aim at some unwary Welsh Fusileer, heedless that from some other point some comrade\u0027s bullet avenged him, or anticipated his fate. To attempt a description of the trenches to a non-military reader, in what Byron terms \"engineering slang,\" would be useless, perhaps; suffice it to say that we were pretty secure from round shot, but never from shells, the trenches or zigzags being dug fairly parallel to the opposing batteries, with a thick bank of earth towards Sebastopol, a banquette for our men to mount on when firing became necessary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Near us was a battery manned by our Royal Artillery--the guns being run through rude portholes made in the earthen bank, with the addition of sand-bags, baskets, and stuffed gabions, to protect the gunners. All was in splendid order there: the breeching-guns ever ready for action; the sponges, rammers, and handspikes lying beside the wheels; the shot piled close by as tidily as if in Woolwich-yard; the carbines of the men placed in racks against the gabions; the officers laughing over an old Punch, or making sketches, varied by caricatures of the Russians, their men sitting close by in their greatcoats, smoking and singing while awaiting orders, and listening with perfect indifference to the casual dropping fire maintained by us against the enemy in the abbatis or pits along our front, though almost every shot was the knell of a human existence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Death and danger were now strangely familiar to us all, and we cared as little for the whish of a round bullet or the sharp ping of the Minie, while it cut the air, as for the deep hoarse booming of the breaching-guns; it was the cry of \"bomb!\" from the look out men, that usually made us start, and sprawl on our faces, or scamper away, for shelter, to crouch with our heads stooped in our favourite or fancied places of security among the gabions, till a soaring monster, with death and mutilation in its womb, with its hoarse puffing that rose to a whistle, concussed all the air by the crash of its explosion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our men were all in their greatcoats, with their white belts outside; and, save when a section or so started angrily to arms, as those fellows in the abattis became more annoying, they sat quietly on the ground or against the wall of the trench, smoking, chatting with perfect equanimity, and occasionally taking a sip of rum or raki from their canteens; for, after weeks and months of this kind of duty, especially after the severity of the Crimean war set in, our older soldiers seemed utterly indifferent as to whether they lived or died.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All of them, even such boys as Tom Clavell, had been front to front with death, again and again. Among ourselves, even, there was an incessant scramble for food; hence in the expression of their faces and eyes there was something hard, set, fierce, and undefinable--half-wolfish at times, devil-may-care always; for in a few weeks after the landing at Eupatoria, they had seen more and lived longer than one can do in years upon years of a life of peace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you see, Hugh, that you look so earnestly to the front?\" I asked of Price, who was lying on his breast with a rifle close beside him, and his field-glass, to which his eyes were applied, wedged in a cranny between two sand-bags.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A Russian devil has made a bolt out of the abattis into yonder hole made by a shell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what of that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am waiting to pot him, as he can\u0027t stay there long,\" replied Price, usually the best of good-natured fellows, but now looking with a tiger-like stare through the same lorgnette which he had used on many a day at the Derby, and many a night at the opera; \"there he comes,\" he added. In a moment the Minie rifle, already sighted, was firmly at the shoulder of Price, who fired; a mass like a gray bundle, with hands and arms outspread, rolled over and over again on the ground, and then lay still; at another time it might have seemed most terribly still!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Potted, by Jove!\" exclaimed Hugh, as he restored the rifle to Sergeant Rhuddlan, and quietly resumed his cigar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A jolly good shot, sir, at four hundred yards,\" added the non-commissioned officer, as he proceeded to reload and cap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that time the life of a Russian was deemed by us of no more account than that of a hare or rabbit in the shooting season; but, if reckless of the lives of others, it must be remembered that we were equally reckless of our own; and, with all its horrors, war is not without producing some of the gentler emotions. Thus, even on those weary, exciting, and perilous days and nights in the trenches, under the influence of camaraderie, of general danger, and the most common chance of a sudden and terrible death, men grew communicative, and while interchanging their canteens and tobacco-pouches they were apt to speak of friends and relations that were far away: the old mother, whose nightly prayers went up for the absent; the ailing sister, who had died since war had been declared; the absent wife, left on the shore at Southampton with a begging-pass to her own parish; the little baby that had been born since the transport sailed; the old fireside, where their place remained vacant, their figure but a shadowy remembrance; the girls they had left behind them; their disappointments in life; their sorrows and joys and hopes for the future; the green lanes, the green fields, the pleasant and familiar places they never more might see: and officers and privates talked of such things in common; so true it is that\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the 3rd of November, Caradoc and I were sitting in a sheltered corner, between the gabions, chatting on some of the themes I have enumerated, when a little commotion was observable among our men, and we saw the adjutant and the major--the worthy holder of Toby Purcell\u0027s spurs, he who had carried off the first gun at Alma, B-- of ours, and who, since Colonel Chesters was killed, had commanded the regiment--coming directly towards us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What the deuce is up?\" said I.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Their faces look important,\" added Caradoc.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sorry to disturb you; not that there is much pleasure here, certainly,\" said the major, smiling; \"but the adjutant tells me that you, Hardinge, are the first officer for duty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are all on duty,\" replied I, laughing; \"if we are not, I don\u0027t know what duty is. Well, major, what is to be done?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are to convey a message from Lord Raglan into Sebastopol.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To Sebastopol?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, to that pleasant city by the sea,\" said the adjutant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To Prince Menschikoff?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" replied the major; \"to the officer commanding the nearest post.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Under a flag of truce?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course; it would be perilous work otherwise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About what is the message?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The capture of Major MacG--, of the 93rd, who was carried off by a kind of sortie the other night, and who is supposed to have been afterwards killed in cold blood.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The seizure of the major of the Sutherland Highlanders, a brave old fellow who had on his breast medals for Candahar, Afghanistan, and Maharajapore, had created much interest in the army at this time, when we so readily believed the Russians liable to commit atrocities on wounded and prisoners.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lord Raglan wishes distinct information on the subject,\" added the adjutant, after a pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right, I am his man,\" said I, starting up and looking carefully to the chambers and capping of my Colt, ere I replaced it in its pouch; and knocking some dust and mud off my somewhat dilapidated regimentals, added, \"now for a drummer and a flag of truce.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are to go to the officer in command of that bastion on the Russian left,\" said the major.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To that wasp of a fellow who is so active, and whose scoundrels have killed so many of our wounded men, firing even on the burial parties?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The same. You must be sharp, wary, and watchful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"His name?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, that you may perhaps learn, not that it matters much; even Lord Raglan cannot know that; but, doubtless, it will be something like a sneeze or two, ending in \u0027off\u0027 or \u0027iski.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Success, Harry!\" cried Caradoc.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few minutes after this saw me issue from the trenches of the right attack, attended by Dicky Roll, with his drum slung before him; in my right hand I carried a Cossack lance, to which a white handkerchief of the largest dimensions was attached to attract attention, as the Russians were not particular to a shade as to what or whom they fired on, and the cruel and infamous massacre of an English boat\u0027s crew at Hango was fresh in the minds of us all; consequently I was not without feeling a certain emotion of anxiety, mingled with ardour and joy at the prospect of Estelle seeing my name in the despatches, as Dicky and I now advanced into the broken and open ground that lay between our parallel and the abattis, amid which I saw head after head appear, as the white emblem I bore announced that pro tem, hostilities in that quarter must cease, by the rules of war.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dicky Roll, who, poor little fellow, had been fraternally sharing his breakfast and blanket with the goat, and did not seem happy in his mind at our increasing proximity to \"them Roosian hogres,\" as he called them, beat a vigorous chamade on his drum, and I waved my impromptu banner. I was glad when a Russian drum responded, as flags of truce had been more than once fired upon, on the miserable plea that communications under them were merely designed for the purpose of gaining intelligence, of reconnoitring Sebastopol and its outposts. Hence our progress was watched with the deepest interest by the whole regiment and others, all of whom were now lining the banquette of the parallels, or clustering at the embrasures and fascines of the breaching batteries.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50379.html","bookId":1147,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:59:49 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:59:49 AM"}
