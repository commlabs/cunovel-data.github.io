He seemed preoccupied with his vodka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity caught the odd tone in his voice and wondered at it. Something wasn\u0027t quite right but she couldn\u0027t put her finger on it. For some reason, it gave her an uneasy sensation to realize just how little she really knew about this man. She turned back to her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Dad, let\u0027s have it. What brings you to Sequence Springs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson contrived to look hurt. \"Can\u0027t a man get a paternal hankering to see his one and only child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, but you could have seen me two months ago down in Mexico if seeing me had been all that important to you,\" Verity pointed out carelessly. \"It certainly would have been a lot more convenient for you. But the fact that you\u0027ve come back to the States without any warning makes me wonder just what you\u0027re up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson sighed and again looked at Jonas. \"That tongue of hers gets sharper every time I see her. It\u0027s getting to the point where she can make a man bleed with a few well-chosen words. She used to be such a sweet, good-natured little girl. Now she\u0027s turning into an old maid before my very eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s mouth tightened ominously. \"Odd that you should say that, Dad. Jonas was just making a similar observation not more than a few hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas narrowed his eyes. \"You should be grateful we\u0027re both concerned about your future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t altogether certain he was teasing her. Deliberately she smiled at him. \"Don\u0027t worry about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf either of you had any common sense you\u0027d spend your time worrying about your own futures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hah,\" her father muttered. \"My future will take care of itself. It always has. But if I let you continue to go your merry way, I\u0027m not going to have any grandchildren to bless my old age and that\u0027s a fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity fought back the warmth in her cheeks. Jonas was smiling faintly. It was time to press the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer my question, Dad. To what do I owe the honor of this midnight visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson swirled the vodka in his glass and looked pained. \"Well, Red, to tell you the truth, I need a place to cool my heels for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit!\" Verity exploded. \"I knew it. You\u0027re in trouble, aren\u0027t you?\" Her hands tightened painfully around her glass. \"Well? What is it this time?\" It was all she could do to keep from hurling the glass across the room. She sensed Jonas\u0027s brooding, watchful gaze, and the knowledge that he was witnessing her loss of control made that loss even worse. \"Go on, tell me. Did you get caught with someone else\u0027s wife? Did you try your hand at smuggling refugees out of some hole-in-the-wall country again? Get behind on your gambling debts? Or is your presence here simply the end result of some barroom brawl that you lost? Who\u0027s looking for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson cleared his throat. \"You see how it is?\" he complained to Jonas. \"No respect. No compassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo concern for her old man. Just demands for explanations and answers, and when she gets them she\u0027ll probably spend half an hour chewing on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027s faint smile broadened briefly but the intent look in his eyes did not lighten. \"What is the explanation, Emerson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man shrugged. \"What can I say? I owe a man a few bucks, that\u0027s all. A debt of honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Debt of honor, my foot,\" Verity muttered. \"A gambling debt is a gambling debt. No need to dress it up the way they did two hundred years ago by calling it a debt of honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father shook his head in woeful regret and turned back to Jonas. \"You\u0027d think after all the history I had her read, she\u0027d have more respect for the subject, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you owe a man a few bucks?\" Jonas prompted calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do and he\u0027s getting a tad anxious, I\u0027m afraid. I told him he\u0027d have to wait awhile, and he told me if he was forced to wait too long, he\u0027d send a few people out to rearrange my face. I deemed it prudent to depart from Mexico and then from Rio. My research was finished down there, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What research?\" Verity asked tightly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson\u0027s eyes brightened. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you? I\u0027m starting a new series of books, Red. Futuristic westerns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Futuristic westerns?\" she asked blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. It\u0027s a natural. Just think what I can do with the combination of traditional western story components and an exotic, extraterrestrial background.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. She told herself she should be accustomed to her father\u0027s ways by now. \"You were in Mexico researching futuristic westerns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great locale and atmosphere. I was just about done, so I called you up to see if you could take a few days off and come down for a visit. You always did like Mexico. But right after I called you, I got the message that this gentleman to whom I owe a certain sizable sum was impatient. I couldn\u0027t reach you to call off the trip, but I figured you\u0027d understand when you arrived and found me gone. In the meantime I thought I\u0027d give Rio a whirl. Hadn\u0027t been there in a while. As it happens, all my problems were solved in Rio. Or almost solved, I should say. There are a couple of small details to work out, which is why I\u0027m here to visit you for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What details?\" Verity asked with deep suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to complete a certain transaction,\" her father explained. \"When it\u0027s finished, I\u0027ll have the cash I need to pay off this rather persistent gentleman who has been hounding me for the past three months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity went cold. \"What kind of transaction?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson gave her a compassionate look and then shook his head at Jonas. \"Look at her. Now she\u0027s convinced I\u0027m running drags.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a spinster, she\u0027s got an active fantasy life,\" Jonas observed gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, both of you,\" Verity snapped. \"Tell me about this transaction, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have come into possession of a very unusual item, Red. It\u0027s in my bag, which is still outside in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m told this item is extremely valuable. Normally such things are sold through auction houses, but I haven\u0027t got time to set up a deal like that. I also lack the kind of paperwork and guarantees of authenticity an auction house likes to see. I need to unload this item quickly for obvious reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need a private collector,\" Jonas said quietly. \"One who is passionately devoted to his hobby and who won\u0027t ask a lot of unnecessary questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson looked at him with respect. \"Exactly. A discreet collector. Preferably one for whom cost is no object. I thought it would be easiest to find one here in the States. But first I need to get the item appraised. I want to know exactly what I\u0027m dealing. So far I\u0027ve only got the former owner\u0027s word that the item is valuable.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-20.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
