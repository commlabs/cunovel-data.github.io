He could feel his heart slow and then begin to beat faster. A sudden, atavistic fear flooded his body, and he reached in his pockets for a book of matches. He had left them in the office. Perhaps the lights were working on the floors below. Moving slowly and cautiously, he groped his way toward the door that led to the stairwell. He pushed the door open. The stairwell was in darkness. Carefully holding onto the railing, he started down into the blackness. In the distance below, he saw the wavering beam of a flashlight moving up the stairs. He was filled with sudden relief. Bigelow, the watchman. \"Bigelow!\" he yelled. \"Bigelow! It\u0027s Dr. Stevens!\" His voice bounced against the stone walls, echoing eerily through the stairwell. The figure holding the flashlight kept climbing silently, inexorably upward. \"Who\u0027s there?\" Judd demanded. The only answer was the echo of his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Judd suddenly knew who was there. His assassins. There had to be at least two of them. One had cut off the power in the basement while the other blocked the stairs to prevent his escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beam of the flashlight was coming closer, only two or three floors below now, climbing rapidly. Judd\u0027s body went cold with fear. His heart began to pound like a trip-hammer, and his legs felt weak. He turned quickly and went back up the stairs to his floor. He opened the door and stood, listening. What if someone were waiting up here in the dark corridor for him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of the footsteps advancing up the stairs were louder now. His mouth dry, Judd turned and made his way along the inky corridor. When he reached the elevators, he began counting office doors. As he reached his office, he heard the stairwell door open. The keys slipped from his nervous fingers and dropped to the floor. He fumbled for them frantically, found them, opened the door to his reception room, and went in, double-locking the door behind him. No one could open it now without a special key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corridor outside, he could hear the sound of approaching footsteps. He went into his private office and flicked the light switch. Nothing happened. There was no power at all in the building. He locked the inner door, then moved to the phone. He fumbled for the dial and dialed the operator. There were three long, steady rings, and then the operator\u0027s voice, Judd\u0027s only link to the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke softly. \"Operator, this is an emergency. This is Dr. Judd Stevens. I want to speak to Detective Frank Angeli at the Nineteenth Precinct. Please hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Your number please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudd gave it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the sound of someone testing the corridor entrance to his private office. They could not get in that way because there was no outside knob on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, Operator!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, please,\" replied the cool, unhurried voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a buzz on the line and then the police switchboard operator spoke. \"Nineteenth Precinct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudd\u0027s heart leaped. \"Detective Angeli,\" he said. \"It\u0027s urgent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Angeli...just a moment, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside in the corridor, something was happening. He could hear the sound of muted voices. Someone had joined the first man. What were they planning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA familiar voice came on the phone. \"Detective Angeli\u0027s not here. This is his partner, Lieutenant McGreavy. Can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Judd Stevens. I\u0027m in my office. The lights are all out and someone\u0027s trying to break in and kill me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heavy silence on the other end. \"Look, Doctor,\" said McGreavy. \"Why don\u0027t you come down here and we\u0027ll talk a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t come down there,\" Judd almost shouted. \"Someone\u0027s trying to murder me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another silence at the other end of the line. McGreavy did not believe him and was not going to help him. Outside, Judd heard a door open, and then the sound of voices in the reception office. They were in the reception office! It was impossible for them to have gotten in without a key. But he could hear them moving, coming toward the door to his private office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGreavy\u0027s voice was coming over the phone, but Judd did not even listen. It was too late. He replaced the receiver. It would not have mattered even if McGreavy had agreed to come. The assassins were here! Life is a very thin thread and it only takes a second to snap it. The fear that gripped him turned to a blind rage. He refused to be slaughtered like Hanson and Carol. He was going to put up a fight. He felt around in the dark for a possible weapon. An ashtray...a letter opener...useless. The assassins would have guns. It was a Kafka nightmare. He was being condemned for no reason by faceless executioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard them moving closer to the inner door and knew that he only had a minute or two left to live. With a strange, dispassionate calm, as though he were his own patient, he examined his final thoughts. He thought of Anne, and a sense of aching loss filled him. He thought of his patients, and of how much they needed him. Harrison Burke. With a pang he remembered that he had not yet told Burke\u0027s employer that Burke had to be committed. He would put the tapes where they could be...His heart lurched. Perhaps he did have a weapon to fight with!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the doorknob turning. The door was locked, but it was flimsy. It would be simple for them to break it in. He quickly groped his way in the dark to the table where he had locked away Burke\u0027s tape. He heard a creak as pressure was applied against the reception-room door. Then he heard someone fumbling at the lock. Why don\u0027t they just break it down? he thought. Somewhere, far back in his mind, he felt the answer was important, but he had no time to think about it now. With trembling fingers he unlocked the drawer with the tape in it. He ripped it out of its cardboard container, then moved over to the tape player and started to thread it. It was an outside chance, but it was the only one he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, concentrating, trying to recall his exact conversation with Burke. The pressure on the door increased. Judd gave a quick, silent prayer. \"I\u0027m sorry about the power going out,\" he said aloud. \"But I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll have it fixed in a few minutes, Harrison. Why don\u0027t you lie down and relax?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise at the door suddenly ceased. Judd had finished threading the tape into the player. He pressed the \"on\" button. Nothing happened. Of course! All the power in the building was off. He could hear them begin to work on the lock again. A feeling of desperation seized him. \"That\u0027s better,\" he said loudly. \"Just make yourself comfortable.\" He fumbled for the packet of matches on the table, found it, tore out a match and lit it. He held the flame close to the tape player. There was a switch marked \"battery.\" He turned the knob, then pressed the \"on\" button again. At that moment, there was a sudden click as the lock on the door sprung open. His last defense was gone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Burke\u0027s voice rang through the room. \"Is that all you\u0027ve got to say? You don\u0027t even want to hear my proof. How do I know you\u0027re not one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudd froze, not daring to move, his heart roaring like thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I\u0027m not one of them,\" said Judd\u0027s voice from the tape. \"I\u0027m your friend. I\u0027m trying to help you... Tell me about your proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They broke into my house last night,\" Burke\u0027s voice said. \"They came to kill me, but I was too clever for them. I sleep in my den now, and I have extra locks on all the doors so they can\u0027t get to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds in the outer office had ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudd\u0027s voice again. \"Did you report the break-in to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not! The police are in it with them. They have orders to shoot me. But they wouldn\u0027t dare do it while there are other people around, so I stay in crowds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you gave me this information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening very carefully to everything you say,\" said Judd\u0027s voice. \"I\u0027ve got it all down\" - at that moment a warning screamed in Judd\u0027s brain; the next words were - \"on tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a dive for the switch and pressed it. \" - in my mind,\" Judd said loudly. \"And we\u0027ll work out the best way to handle it.\" He stopped. He could not play the tape again because he had no way of telling where to pick it up. His only hope was that the men outside were convinced that Judd had a patient in the office with him. Even if they believed that, would it stop them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cases like this,\" Judd said, raising his voice, \"are really more common than you\u0027d believe, Harrison.\" He gave an impatient exclamation. \"I wish they\u0027d get these lights back on. I know your chauffeur\u0027s waiting out in front for you. He\u0027ll probably wonder what\u0027s wrong and come up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudd stopped and listened. He could hear whispering from the other side of the door. What were they deciding? From the distant street below, he suddenly heard the insistent wail of an approaching siren. The whispering stopped. He listened for the sound of the outer door closing, but he could hear nothing. Were they still out there, waiting? The scream of the siren grew louder. It stopped in front of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly all the lights went on. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-naked-face/page-7.html","bookId":2354,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:51 AM"}
