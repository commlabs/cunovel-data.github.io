In the meantime, I’m changing into something cute and cool and sure to wow them over at Hunky Harry’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, all you have to do is walk into Hunky Harry’s to wow everyone,” Sarah assured her. “Trust me, you’re ‘wow’ material even in what you’re wearing now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lectures they gave covered topics ranging from the coming of the first Spaniards to British rule, American rule, the Confederacy, Henry Flagler and the railroad, Prohibition and beyond, and they had different outfits to wear for each. Today they were focused on the Seminole Wars and the Civil War. So today they weren’t dressed in silk and satin as would befit a pair of Southern belles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday they wore homespun cotton skirts and prim shirts that buttoned chastely to the neck. They were middle-class women of the era, those who churned butter and milked cows. And still, Caroline looked adorable. Sarah had yet to see a style from any era that Caroline didn’t wear well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, Miss McKinley, you do go on,” Caroline said with a mock simper. “And my, my, but if you aren’t just a plate of buttered grits yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, yeah, Missy-yourself, let’s just change and get out of here,” Sarah said as they left the lecture hall. Barry Travis, in breeches and a homespun cotton shirt, was also heading toward the door marked Cast Members Only. He was a tall, handsome man of thirty, with longish brown hair that worked well in historical context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you two can get changed quickly, because I’m starving. Renee is ushering the last of the book buyers out the front door, and we are officially closed,” he said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sarah’s not coming,” Caroline informed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t,” Sarah said. “My house needs me.” She smiled to acknowledge that even she knew how silly that sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” he said, studying her and shaking his head, “you could have bought a nice new condo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be other nights,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if the world ends tomorrow?” Barry demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My house will be one day closer to done, and Gary won’t hate me,” Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I give up,” Barry said. “We’ll miss you as we dine on succulent burgers—oh, wait. You didn’t suddenly become a vegetarian, did you?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s a fish-a-tarian, I believe,” Caroline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pescatarian,” Barry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever,” Caroline agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t matter. You can torture me with thoughts of food and I won’t care. Besides, I’m not sure anything at Hunky Harry’s is actually succulent. Anyway, have a great time, and drink a beer for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a good thing Harry didn’t hear you say that. And it’s not true—the food there is good,” Barry protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you’re right. The food is very good, especially the fish. But I can’t go. Not tonight,” Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried into the women’s locker room and quickly changed. Caroline had been right about one thing: she should stop and pick up a six-pack. Maybe a twelve-pack. Gary had a few employees working overtime right along with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to escape without getting into further conversation, because when Caroline came in, she headed straight for the showers. Was she primping so hard for Will? Maybe. The two of them had always liked one another, but Sarah had never seen any signs that their relationship was anything beyond friendship. Then again, who knew? They said that friends made the best spouses. She certainly didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d fallen in love once, and it had been a brief and poignant affair. Clay Jenner had been a soldier. They’d met in Newport News, and had quickly discovered they both loved Buddy Holly, Peggy Lee, lounge music and historic ships. They’d spent a few months laughing, talking, listening to music and exploring historic sites. Then he’d been deployed. He’d been wonderfully romantic, going down on one knee when the cherry blossoms had been exploding all over the park, and he’d offered her the diamond she now wore on a chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t come home. That had been three years ago now, and although she would probably never get over the pain of losing him, she had accepted that he wasn’t coming back. He had gone into the military for the schooling and the benefits, but, as he had told her, he’d signed the paper swearing that he would obey his superior officers and defend his country. It would have been nice if he could have served out his time somewhere safe, like Germany, but it hadn’t happened that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been killed in a sniper attack. A bullet straight through the brain. He had probably never known what had hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that she was grateful. As her dad had told her once, every man and woman would die. An easy death was something that meant even though God might take a man early, he loved him enough to keep him from suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was glad to be home, where there were no memories of Clay, and glad to have moved into her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t drive to work anymore; her house and the museum were in the area that was referred to as Old Town. After stopping for a twelve-pack and walking another four blocks through enclaves of tourist-centric businesses, she was thinking that a six-pack would have been fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost at the walk that led up to her house when she saw him. The man she had noticed during her lecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many buildings in Old Town sat right up near the sidewalk, there was actually a stretch of lawn in front of her place, along with a front walk and driveway—they’d needed a place for the cars and hearses to go. The man was only on the sidewalk, but he was right at the start of the coquina shell walk that led to her front porch. And he was staring at the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have sensed that she was watching him, because he turned, looked at her gravely, then smiled as she walked toward him, eyeing him carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, hello. It’s Ms. McKinley, right?” he said. “Excellent lecture—thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, staring at him warily. “Can I…help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was admiring the house,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t sure if she should say that it was hers or not. People had a tendency to be friendly in St. Augustine. In fact, there were dozens of B\u0026amp;Bs in the city, most of them homes that were open to strangers. In fact, she couldn’t wait for her own house to be one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at the moment, she apparently had a bigger-city attitude going. And the first rule was never let a stranger know where you live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t look like a stalker. In fact, he was extremely attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reminded herself that many a serial killer had been attractive. They weren’t all wild-eyed Charles Mansons. Ted Bundy had traded on his boy-next-door good looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided she was being ridiculous. The odds were strongly in favor of his being a tourist, one with an interest in history, given that she’d first seen him at the museum. Plus, there were still plenty of people about on the streets, and though the day was dying, there was still lots of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t seem to need a reply. “The architecture is striking. It’s quite a compelling place. Haunting, even.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” she said. When he looked at her curiously, she added, “I own it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a moment, then laughed. “Of course, I shouldn’t be surprised that a historian owns a piece of history. I see you have a lot of work going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you buy an old building, you have to be prepared for a lot of work,” she told him. The twelve-pack was getting heavy but she fought against shifting the weight. She didn’t want him offering to carry it and walk her up to the house. It wasn’t a B\u0026amp;B yet, just a big old place without an alarm, and she didn’t own a dog—not even a teacup Yorkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he didn’t seem the menacing type. He looked far more likely to go after what he wanted with wit and charm. My, how her thoughts had quickly wandered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, congratulations on owning such a beautiful old place. Oh, by the way, my name is Caleb Anderson. And I know you’re Sarah McKinley. It’s been a pleasure to meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Likewise,” she said. Then she startled herself by what she said next, because he had already turned to walk away. “Are you in town long?” she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought he hesitated before answering—only a half second, but a hesitation all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure. I’ll be around a few more days, at least. Thanks again. I really enjoyed your lecture—especially the way you handled those kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a hand. “Hope to see you again,” he said casually and walked on, heading in the direction of Old Town and the shops that stayed open into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him go, then felt the heaviness of the twelve-pack again. She turned and hurried inside, and was immediately glad of her efforts. Gary Morton, all muscles and friendly smiles, kissed her cheek and told her she was brilliant. The two men working with him were equally happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although I did wonder when you were actually going to make it into the house,” Gary said. “Who’s the hunk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hunk?” she asked, pretending not to know exactly who he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tall, well-built guy you were just talking to out front?” he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Just some guy who was at one of the lectures today. He was admiring the house. This is the historic district—people are supposed to admire my house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Are you sure it was just the house he was admiring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “Since he was staring at the house before I got there, I’m assuming that, yeah, it was just the house he was admiring. Anyway, we—as in you and me—were invited to dinner,” she told him. “Will, Caroline, and Renee and Brad from the museum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? You didn’t invite Mr. Gorgeous?” he queried, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gary…” she said warningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay. Don’t hit me.” He put up a hand as if to protect himself, smiling all the while. “But pizza is good enough for me. I want to get this place in shape for you, so I need to knock out that last wall. I know it means a lot of work and a lot of mess, but you can’t have a leaking water pipe. It will destroy the whole place on you, given time. You can go ahead if you want to. You don’t have to be here wielding a sledgehammer.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unhallowed-ground-harrison-investigation-7/page-4.html","bookId":2273,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:47 PM"}
