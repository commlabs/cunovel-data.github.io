{"id":67993,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003eSix months from the day Tony and Marianne were married, the Hoffman company was absorbed into Kruger-Brent, Ltd. The formal signing of the contracts took place in Munich as a gesture to Frederick Hoffman, who would run the subsidiary from Germany. Tony had been surprised by the meekness with which his mother accepted his marriage. It was not like her to lose gracefully, yet she had been cordial to Marianne when Tony and his bride returned from their honeymoon in the Bahamas, and had told Tony how pleased she was with the marriage. What puzzled Tony was that her sentiments seemed genuine. It was too quick a turnaround, out of character for her. Perhaps, Tony decided, he did not understand his mother as well as he thought he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marriage was a brilliant success from the beginning. Marianne filled a long-felt need in Tony, and everyone around him noticed the change in him - especially Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tony took business trips, Marianne accompanied him. They played together, they laughed together, they truly enjoyed each other. Watching them, Kate thought happily, I have done well for my son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Marianne who succeeded in healing the breach between Tony and his mother. When they returned from their honeymoon, Marianne said, \"I want to invite your mother to dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You don\u0027t know her, Marianne. She - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get to know her. Please, Tony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated the idea, but in the end he gave in. Tony had been prepared for a grim evening, but he had been surprised. Kate had been touchingly happy to be with them. The following week Kate invited them to the house for dinner, and after that it became a weekly ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate and Marianne became friends. They spoke to each other over the telephone several times a week, and lunched together at least once a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were meeting for lunch at Lutece, and the moment Marianne walked in, Kate knew something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like a double whiskey, please,\" Marianne told the captain. \"Over ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a rule, Marianne drank only wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happened, Marianne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been to see Dr. Harley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate felt a sudden stab of alarm. \"You\u0027re not ill, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m just fine. Only...\" The whole story came tumbling out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had begun a few days earlier. Marianne had not been feeling well, and she had made an appointment with John Harley...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look healthy enough,\" Dr. Harley smiled. \"How old are you, Mrs. Blackwell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any history of heart disease in your family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was making notes. \"Cancer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your parents alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father is. My mother died in an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever had mumps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Measles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. When I was ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whooping cough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any surgery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonsils. I was nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than that, you\u0027ve never been hospitalized for anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Well, yes - that is, once. Briefly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on the girls\u0027 hockey team at school and during a game I blacked out. I woke up in a hospital. I was only there two days. It was really nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you suffer an injury during the game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I - I just blacked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old were you then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen. The doctor said it was probably some kind of adolescent glandular upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Harley sat forward in his chair. \"When you woke up, do you remember if you felt any weakness on either side of your body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarianne thought a moment. \"As a matter of fact, yes. My right side. But it went away in a few days. I haven\u0027t had anything like it since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have headaches? Blurred vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But they went away, too.\" She was beginning to be alarmed. \"Do you think there\u0027s something wrong with me, Dr. Harley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027d like to make a few tests - just to be on the safe side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of tests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to do a cerebral angiogram. Nothing to be concerned about. We can have it done right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later, Marianne received a call from Dr. Harley\u0027s nurse asking her to come in. John Harley was waiting for her in his office. \"Well, we\u0027ve solved the mystery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it something bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. The angiogram showed that what you had, Mrs. Blackwell, was a small stroke. Medically, it\u0027s called a berry aneurysm, and it\u0027s very common in women - particularly in teen-age girls. A small blood vessel in the brain broke and leaked small amounts of blood. The pressure is what caused the headaches and blurred vision. Fortunately, those things are self-healing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarianne sat there listening, her mind fighting panic. \"What - what does all this mean, exactly? Could it happen again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very unlikely.\" He smiled. \"Unless you\u0027re planning to go out for the hockey team again, you can live an absolutely normal life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony and I like to ride and play tennis. Is that - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you don\u0027t overdo, everything goes. From tennis to sex. No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled in relief. \"Thank God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Marianne rose, John Harley said, \"There is one thing, Mrs. Blackwell. If you and Tony are planning to have children, I would advise adopting them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarianne froze. \"You said I was perfectly normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. Unfortunately, pregnancy increases the vascular volume enormously. And during the last six to eight weeks of pregnancy, there\u0027s an additional increase in blood pressure. With the history of that aneurysm, the risk factor would be un-acceptably high. It would not only be dangerous - it could be fatal. Adoptions are really quite easy these days. I can arrange - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Marianne was no longer listening. She was hearing Tony\u0027s voice: I want us to have a baby. A little girl who looks exactly like you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...I couldn\u0027t bear to hear any more,\" Marianne told Kate. \"I ran out of his office and came straight here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate made a tremendous effort not to let her feelings show. It was a stunning blow. But there had to be a way. There was always a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed a smile and said, \"Well! I was afraid it was going to be something much worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Kate, Tony and I want so much to have a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marianne, Dr. Harley is an alarmist. You had a minor problem years ago, and Harley\u0027s trying to turn it into something important. You know how doctors are.\" She took Marianne\u0027s hand. \"You feel well, don\u0027t you, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt wonderful until - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there you are. You aren\u0027t going around having any fainting spells?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s all over. He said himself that those things are self-healing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said the risks - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate sighed. \"Marianne, every time a woman gets pregnant, there\u0027s always a risk. Life is full of risks. The important thing in life is to decide which risks are the ones worth taking, don\u0027t you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Marianne sat there thinking. She made her decision. \"You\u0027re right. Let\u0027s not say anything to Tony. It would only worry him. We\u0027ll keep it our secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate thought, I could bloody well kill John Harley for scaring her to death. \"It will be our secret,\" Kate agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree months later, Marianne became pregnant. Tony was thrilled. Kate was quietly triumphant. Dr. John Harley was horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll arrange for an immediate abortion,\" he told Marianne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dr. Harley. I feel fine. I\u0027m going to have the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Marianne told Kate about her visit, Kate stormed into John Harley\u0027s office. \"How dare you suggest my daughter-in-law have an abortion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kate, I told her that if she carries that baby to term, there\u0027s a chance it might kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that. She\u0027s going to be fine. Stop alarming her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight months later, at four A.M. in early February, Marianne\u0027s labor pains began prematurely. Her moans awakened Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began hurriedly dressing. \"Don\u0027t worry, darling. I\u0027ll have you at the hospital in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pains were agonizing. \"Please hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered whether she should have told Tony about her conversations with Dr. Harley. No, Kate had been right. It was her decision to make. Life was so wonderful that God would not let anything bad happen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Marianne and Tony arrived at the hospital, everything was in readiness. Tony was escorted to a waiting room. Marianne was taken into an examining room. The obstetrician, Dr. Mattson, took Marianne\u0027s blood pressure. He frowned and took it again. He looked up and said to his nurse, \"Get her into the operating room - fast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony was at the cigarette machine in the hospital corridor when a voice behind him said, \"Well, well, if it isn\u0027t Rembrandt.\" Tony turned. He recognized the man who had been with Dominique in front of her apartment building. What had she called him? Ben. The man was staring at Tony, an antagonistic expression on his face. Jealousy? What had Dominique told him? At that moment, Dominique appeared. She said to Ben, \"The nurse said Michelline is in intensive care. We\u0027ll come - \" She saw Tony, and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony! What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife is having a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did your mother arrange it?\" Ben asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dominique told me your mother arranges everything for you, sonny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben! Stop it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? It\u0027s the truth, isn\u0027t it, baby? Isn\u0027t that what you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony turned to Dominique. \"What is he talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" she said quickly. \"Ben, let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ben was enjoying himself. \"I wish I had a mother like yours, buddy boy. You want a beautiful model to sleep with, she buys you one. You want to have an art exhibition in Paris, she arranges it for you. You - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" Ben turned to Dominique. \"Doesn\u0027t he know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I know what?\" Tony demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Tony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said my mother arranged the exhibition in Paris. That\u0027s a lie, isn\u0027t it?\" He saw the expression on Dominique\u0027s face. \"Isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dominique said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean she had to pay Goerg to - to show my paintings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony, he really liked your paintings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him about the art critic,\" Ben urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough, Ben!\" Dominique turned to go. Tony grabbed her arm. \"Wait! What about him? Did my mother arrange for him to be at the exhibit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Dominique\u0027s voice had dropped to a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he hated my paintings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear the pain in his voice. \"No, Tony. He didn\u0027t. Andre d\u0027Usseau told your mother you could have become a great artist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was face to face with the unbelievable. \"My mother paid d\u0027Usseau to destroy me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to destroy you. She believed she was doing it for your own good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enormity of what his mother had done was staggering. Everything she had told him was a lie. She had never intended to let him live his own life. And Andre d\u0027Usseau! How could a man like that be bought? But of course Kate would know the price of any man. Wilde could have been referring to Kate when he talked of someone who knew the price of everything, the value of nothing. Everything had always been for the company. And the company was Kate Blackwell. Tony turned and walked blindly down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the operating room, the doctors were fighting desperately to save Marianne\u0027s life. Her blood pressure was alarmingly low, and her heartbeat was erratic. She was given oxygen and a blood transfusion, but it was useless. Marianne was unconscious from a cerebral hemorrhage when the first baby was delivered, and dead three minutes later when the second twin was taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony heard a voice calling, \"Mr. Blackwell.\" He turned. Dr. Mattson was at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have two beautiful, healthy twin daughters, Mr. Black-well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony saw the look in his eyes. \"Marianne - she\u0027s all right, isn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Mattson took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m so sorry. We did everything we could. She died on the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She what?\" It was a scream. Tony grabbed Dr. Mattson\u0027s lapels and shook him. \"You\u0027re lying! She\u0027s not dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Blackwell - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she? I want to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go in just now. They\u0027re preparing her - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony cried out, \"You killed her, you bastard! You killed her.\" He began attacking the doctor. Two interns hurried in and grabbed Tony\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now take it easy, Mr. Blackwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony fought like a madman. \"I want to see my wife!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. John Harley hurried up to the group. \"Let him go,\" he commanded. \"Leave us alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Mattson and the interns left. Tony was weeping brokenly. \"John, they k-killed Marianne. They m-murdered her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s dead, Tony, and I\u0027m sorry. But no one murdered her. I told her months ago if she went ahead with this pregnancy it could kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a long moment for the words to sink in. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marianne didn\u0027t tell you? Your mother didn\u0027t say anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony was staring at him, his eyes uncomprehending. \"My mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She thought I was being an alarmist. She advised Marianne to go ahead with it. I\u0027m so sorry, Tony. I\u0027ve seen the twins. They\u0027re beautiful. Wouldn\u0027t you like to - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate\u0027s butler opened the door for Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Mr. Blackwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Lester.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler took in Tony\u0027s disheveled appearance. \"Is everything all right, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything is fine. Would you make me a cup of coffee, Lester?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony watched the butler move toward the kitchen. Now, Tony, the voice in his head commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Now. Tony turned and walked into the trophy room. He went to the cabinet that held the gun collection, and he stared at the gleaming array of instruments of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen the cabinet, Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened it. He selected a revolver from the gun rack and checked the barrel to make sure it was loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027ll be upstairs, Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony turned and started up the stairs. He knew now that it was not his mother\u0027s fault that she was evil. She was possessed, and he was going to cure her. The company had taken her soul, and Kate was not responsible for what she did. His mother and the company had become one, and when he killed her, the company would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was outside Kate\u0027s bedroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen the door, the voice commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony opened the door. Kate was dressing in front of a mirror when she heard the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony! What on earth - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carefully aimed the gun at her and began squeezing the trigger. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-22.html","bookId":2358,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM"}
