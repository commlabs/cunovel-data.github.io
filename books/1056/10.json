WHAT BECAME OF THE DOLPHIN.","content":"But what of the others?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What had happened?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barney and Clifford were holding vigil at the opening to the hatchway. They were waiting eagerly for word from Frank Reade, Jr.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All of a sudden there was a blinding flash of brightest light, an awful roar and a shock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both men were lifted as if by a catapult and whirled away in surging masses of water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They had instinctive sense enough to cling to each other through all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed an interminable length of time that they were tossed and hurled and carried through the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they sank and once more felt the bed of the ocean beneath them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They lay upon the sands for some little while.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the water grew calm about them and they recovered themselves. They sat up and looked about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The locality did not greatly differ from the one they had left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was the same expanse of sand and coral reef.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their helmet lights made a limited circle of radiance about them. Beyond that all was darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well,” exclaimed Clifford, placing his helmet against Barney’s, “what does this mean?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 40“Shure, sor; it beats me. I’m afther thinkin’ somethin’ blew up!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, yes, there was an explosion.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shure, sor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But what was it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m sthuck, sor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Could it have been the Dolphin?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barney shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll niver believe that, sor. No, it’s my opinion that thim omadhouns av the Aurelian had the insthrumentality av it all.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clifford gave a start.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have it!” he cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Phwat, sor?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is the work of Parker. He dropped a torpedo down upon us. It’s a wonder that it did not kill us. If his aim had been true we should now be dead!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Celt looked his horror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shure, an’ phwat av it sthruck the Dolphin?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I do not think it fell in that locality,” declared Clifford, “though I have no doubt the Dolphin felt the shock somewhat.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Barney gave a wild start.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But, shure, sor, it’s fools we are to be here an’ leave Misther Frank phwere he is.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is right,” agreed Clifford. “We must go and look for him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With which they got upon their feet and looked about them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nothing was to be seen of the Dolphin or her searchlight. All was gloom about them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But beyond the circle of their helmet lamps Clifford saw a white reef.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The sunken galleon is on the other side of that,” he said; “the shock of the explosion carried us over here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All roight, sor!” cried Barney, with alacrity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So they set out for the reef. Below was a sandy plain, and they fancied they could see the excavation over the galleon’s deck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But when they reached the spot it was not there. Nor was there anything at all familiar in the surroundings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well,” muttered Clifford. “I can’t say that I like this. Let us look on further.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 41And this they proceeded to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From one spot to another they wandered. But each grew less familiar and the more strongly impressed the fact upon them that they were lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hundreds of fathoms from the surface in very mid-ocean. What an awful reflection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It held the two men aghast. Nothing but despair and death hung over them like a grim pall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile what of the Dolphin and Pomp and Hartley?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the moment that the torpedo exploded Pomp was adjusting the searchlight, and Hartley was watching the operations of his friends in digging for the galleon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They have found it, Pomp!” he cried; “and Frank has gone down into it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Golly! I done hope nuffin happen to him down dere!” cried the coon. “I’se drefful afeared ob gittin’ in some place laike dat whar yo’ never kin git out!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I share your fears, Pomp,” said Hartley. “Yet we must admit that Frank knows his business well.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fo’ suah, sah!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The words were barely out of Pomp’s lips when he saw a distant object come sliding down through the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wha’ ‘am dat?” he muttered, but said no more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The instant the object touched the bed of the sea, there was a fearful, blinding flash, an awful boom and shock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then all was chaos and oblivion for a time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Dolphin was picked up as if it was a bubble, and hurled through the waters most violently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed as if it would never cease whirling, when there was a crash and a shock. Then Pomp found himself standing on his head in a corner of the cabin, and Hartley was jammed into another corner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was some moments before either recovered breath enough to speak.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then suddenly the electric lights were paled by the light of day. Both glanced through the windows and saw that they were on the surface of the sea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Aurelian was seen some distance away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Jemina!” exclaimed Hartley as he gained his feet, “what on earth happened to us?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Golly, dat am jes’ wha’ I was finkin’!” cried Pomp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, rubbing their bruises, they looked about to see what harm had been done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 42But the boat was apparently uninjured, and floated lightly on the rolling waves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But certainly something had happened to bring the boat to the surface in such a startling manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What this was Hartley tried to think. Then all came to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “By the north star!” he cried, “that was a torpedo those rascals exploded, thinking to annihilate us!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A torpedo!” exclaimed Pomp. “Den it am berry lucky dat we was not blowed up!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Indeed it was!” exclaimed Hartley. “I wish I had a gun; I’d sink their infernal craft!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hi, dar—look out!” yelled Pomp. “Dey hab got a gun fo’ suah!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A puff of smoke leaped from the side of the Aurelian. There was a distant boom, and a shot passed not a foot above the vessel’s rail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The aim was not so close as it would be next time, and Hartley knew it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Look out, Pomp!” he cried, “they mean to sink us! Send her to the bottom again!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Golly, dat am jes’ wha’ I will do!” cried the darky.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sprung to the keyboard. He swung the tank lever about. But the boat did not sink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The darky was astounded. A shade of dismay crept across his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fo’ de lan’s sake!” he muttered. “Wha’ am de mattah? Am anyfing bruk?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mercy on us!” cried Hartley; “don’t say that, Pomp! What will become of Frank and the others?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a fearful reflection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Boom!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Another shot came within an inch of taking away the bow of the submarine boat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They are a set of pirates and murderers!” cried Hartley angrily; “show them no mercy!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Massy Lordy! It don’ look as if we was gwine fo’ to hab de chance!” declared the coon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, don’t expose the boat any longer to the shots. We must at least get out of here!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yo’ am right, sah! Yer goes!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The coon put on speed and sped beyond range of the Aurelian’s 43gun. Then Pomp applied himself to the all-important matter of repairing the boat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pomp was not as thorough a mechanic as Barney, yet he knew something of the mechanism of the Dolphin. He worked zealously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He found eventually that the shock had dislodged a piece of steel plating in the bulkhead, which had fallen into the cogs of the tank trucks and so obstructed them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To remove this was a matter of no little effort and time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It required six hours of active work to put the damaged trucks back into good shape.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All this while the Aurelian had been sending down divers as Hartley saw through his glass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whether they had discovered the treasure or not was a question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If they had, then there must have been some sort of an encounter, and Pomp and Hartley feared for the safety of their friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pomp worked like a Trojan to get the boat into working order again, for he knew the importance of at once going to the rescue of the lost ones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But of a sudden the Aurelian seemed to be pulling up anchor and getting ready to sail away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cause of this move was for a time a mystery to Pomp and Hartley.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the captain chanced to glance at the horizon, and cried:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “On my word, mate, I see the reason for it. Look yonder!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Up from the southern horizon great masses of yellow clouds were piling up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sky had a brassy look, and the sea was lead-like.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A storm, sah!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes!” cried the captain; “it is a storm coming up, and they mean to shift their position. Probably they will run for the protection of some cay near here. There is one on the western sea line. It is, I think, Miller’s Cay.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dat am berry funny!” muttered Pomp, shaking his head; “but it gibs us a good chance.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are right! How is the tank?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A’right now, sah! I done fink we can go to the bottom berry quick, sah.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 44Pomp closed the doors, and then went into the pilot-house. He pressed the tank lever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At once the boat began to sink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Down she went steadily, and Pomp, flashing the searchlight, finally saw the bottom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Under the sea the Dolphin had nothing to fear from the hurricane. This was her advantage over the Aurelian.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was now in order to find the missing men of the crew. What their fate was could only be guessed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Pomp sent the submarine boat forward at full speed. In a very few moments she was in the vicinity of the spot from which she had been driven by the explosion of the bomb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the exact location did not seem easy to find.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dat am berry funny!” declared Pomp, after cruising aimlessly about for awhile. “Wherebber can dey hab bin? Whar am dat sunken ship?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A sharp spasmodic cry suddenly escaped Hartley’s lips and he said hoarsely:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My soul! Look yonder. What is that?”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1797/52229.html","bookId":1056,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:15:17 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:15:17 AM"}
