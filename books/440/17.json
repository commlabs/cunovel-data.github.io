{"id":13215,"no":17,"title":"XVII \"OH, CONNIE, DEAR--NOTHING--GO ON\"","content":"The third evening came. On all the borders of dear Dixie more tents than ever whitened sea-shores and mountain valleys, more sentinels paced to and fro in starlight or rain, more fifers and trumpeters woke the echoes with strains to enliven fortitude, more great guns frowned silently at each other over more parapets, and more thousands of lovers reclined about camp fires with their hearts and fancies at home, where mothers and maidens prayed in every waking moment for God\u0027s mercy to keep the brave truants; and with remembrance of these things Anna strove to belittle her own distress while about the library lamp she and Miranda seemed each to be reading a book, and Constance the newspaper sent from Charleston by Mandeville.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Out in the mellow night a bird sang from the tip-top of a late-blooming orange tree, and inside, away inside, inside and through and through the poor girl\u0027s heart, the \"years\"--which really were nothing but the mantel clock\u0027s quarter-hours--\"crept slowly by.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At length she laid her book aside, softly kissed each seated companion, and ascended to her room and window. There she stood long without sound or motion, her eyes beyond the stars, her head pressed wearily against the window frame. Then the lids closed while her lips formed soft words:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, God, he is not coming!\" Stillness again. And then--\"Oh, let me believe yet that only Thy hand keeps him away! Is it to save him for some one fairer and better? God, I ask but to know! I\u0027m a rebel, but not against Thee, dear Lord. I know it\u0027s a sin for me to suffer this way; Thou dost not owe me happiness; I owe it Thee. Oh, God, am I clamoring for my week\u0027s wages before I\u0027ve earned an hour\u0027s pay? Yet oh! yet oh!\"--the head rocked heavily on its support--\"if only--if only--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She started--listened! A gate opened--shut. She sprang to her glass and then from it. In soft haste she needlessly closed the window and drew its shade and curtains. She bathed her eyelids and delicately dried them. At the mirror again she laid deft touches on brow and crown, harkening between for any messenger\u0027s step, and presently, without reason, began to set the room more exquisitely to rights. Now she faced the door and stood attentive, and now she took up a small volume and sat down by her lamp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A tap: Constance entered, beaming only too tenderly. \"It was better, wasn\u0027t it,\" she asked, hovering, \"to come than to send?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, of course, dear; it always is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A meditative silence followed. Then Anna languidly inquired, \"Who is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nobody but Charlie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The inquirer brightened: \"And why isn\u0027t Charlie as good as any one?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is, to-night,\" replied the elder beauty, \"except--the one exception.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Connie\"--a slight flush came as the seated girl smilingly drew her sister\u0027s hands down to her bosom--\"there isn\u0027t any one exception, and there\u0027s not going to be any. Now, that smile is downright mean of you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The offender atoned with a kiss on the brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why do you say,\" asked its recipient, \"\u0027as good as any one, to-night\u0027?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because,\" was the soft reply, \"to-night he comes from--the other--to explain why the other couldn\u0027t come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why!\"--the flush came back stronger--\"why, Connie! why, that\u0027s positively silly--ha, ha, ha!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t see how, Nan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear Con! Isn\u0027t his absence equally and perfectly innocent whether he couldn\u0027t come or wouldn\u0027t come? But an explanation sent!--by courier!--to--to shorten--ah, ha, ha!--to shorten our agony! Why, Con, wouldn\u0027t you have thought better of him than that? H-oh, me! What a man\u0027s \u0027bound to be\u0027 I suppose he\u0027s bound to be. What is the precious explanation?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With melting eyes Constance shook her head. \"You don\u0027t deserve to hear it,\" she replied. Her tears came: \"My little sister, I\u0027m on the man\u0027s side in this affair!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not good of you,\" murmured Anna.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t claim to be good. But there\u0027s one thing, Nan Callender, I never did; I never chained up my lover to see if he\u0027d stay chained. When Steve--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh-h! Oh-h!\" panted Anna, \"you\u0027re too cruel! Hilary Kincaid wears no chain of mine!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, yes, he does! He\u0027s broken away, but he\u0027s broken away, chain and all, to starve and perish, as one look into his face would show you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He doesn\u0027t show his face. He sends--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"An explanation. Yes. Which first you scorn and then consent to hear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t scorn me, Connie. What\u0027s the explanation?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s this: he\u0027s been sent back to those Mobile fortifications--received the order barely in time to catch the boat by going instantly. Nan, the Valcours\u0027 house is found to stand right on their proposed line, and he\u0027s gone to decide whether the line may be changed or the house must be demolished.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anna rose, twined an arm in her sister\u0027s and with her paced the chamber. \"How perfectly terrible!\" she murmured, their steps ceasing and her eyes remote in meditation. \"Poor Flora! Oh, the poor old lady! And oh, oh, poor Flora!--But, Con! The line will be changed! He--you know what the boys call him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but there\u0027s the trouble. He\u0027s no one lady\u0027s man. Like Steve, he\u0027s so absolutely fair--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Connie, I tell you it\u0027s a strange line he won\u0027t change for Flora Valcour!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Nan Callender! The line will go where it ought to go. By the by, Charlie says neither Flora nor her grandmother knows the house is in danger. Of course, if it is harmed, the harm will be paid for.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, paid for!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, Nan, I\u0027m as sorry for them as you. But I don\u0027t forget to be sorry for Hilary Kincaid too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Connie\"--walk resumed, speaker\u0027s eyes on the floor--\"if you\u0027d only see that to me he\u0027s merely very interesting--entertaining--nothing more whatever--I\u0027d like to say just a word about him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say on, precious.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well--did you ever see a man so fond of men?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, of course he is, or men wouldn\u0027t be so fond of him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think he\u0027s fonder of men than of women!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Constance smiled: \"Do you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I think,\" persisted Anna, \"the reason some women find him so agreeable is that our collective society is all he asks of us, or ever will ask.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nan Callender, look me in the eye! You can\u0027t! My little sister, you\u0027ve got a lot more sense than I have, and you know it, but I can tell you one thing. When Steve and I--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Connie, dear--nothing--go on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t! Except to say some lovers take love easy and some--can\u0027t. I must go back to Charlie. I know, Nan, it\u0027s those who love hardest that take love hardest, and I suppose it\u0027s born in Hilary Kincaid, and it\u0027s born in you, to fight it as you\u0027d fight fire. But, oh, in these strange times, don\u0027t do it! Don\u0027t do it. You\u0027re going to have trouble a-plenty without.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The pair, moving to the door with hands on each other\u0027s shoulders, exchanged a melting gaze. \"Trouble a-plenty,\" softly asked Anna, \"why do you--?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, why, why, why!\" cried the other, with a sudden gleam of tears. \"I wish you and Miranda had never learned that word.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62664.html","bookId":440,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:16:00 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:16:00 AM"}
