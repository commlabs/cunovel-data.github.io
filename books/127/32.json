That was the time to begin\u0026nbsp; all-out prevention of war. Iplayed them\u0026nbsp; one against the other.\u0026nbsp; I helped each in\u0026nbsp; turn. I offered themscience,\u0026nbsp; trade, education,\u0026nbsp; scientific medicine.\u0026nbsp; I made Terminus\u0026nbsp; of morevalue to\u0026nbsp; them as a flourishing\u0026nbsp; world than as a\u0026nbsp; military prize. It workedfor thirty years.\"\"Yes, but you were\u0026nbsp; forced to surround these scientific gifts with the mostoutrageous mummery.\u0026nbsp; You\u0027ve made half religion,\u0026nbsp; half balderdash out of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e You\u0027ve erected a hierarchy of priests and complicated, meaningless ritual.\"Hardin frowned. \"What of\u0026nbsp; that? I don\u0027t see that it has anything to do withthe argument\u0026nbsp; at all.\u0026nbsp; I started that\u0026nbsp; way at first\u0026nbsp; because the barbarianslooked upon our science as a sort of magical sorcery, and it was easiest toget them to accept\u0026nbsp; it on that basis. The priesthood built itself and if wehelp it\u0026nbsp; along we are only following the line of\u0026nbsp; least resistance. It is aminor matter.\"\"But these\u0026nbsp; priests are in charge of the power plants.\u0026nbsp; That is not a minormatter.\"\"True, but\u0026nbsp; we have trained them. Their knowledge\u0026nbsp; of their tools is purelyempirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them.\"\"And if one pierces\u0026nbsp; through the mummery, and has the genius to brush asideempiricism,\u0026nbsp; what is to\u0026nbsp; prevent him\u0026nbsp; from learning actual\u0026nbsp; techniques, andselling out\u0026nbsp; to the most satisfactory\u0026nbsp; bidder? What price our\u0026nbsp; value to thekingdoms, then?\"\"Little chance of that,\u0026nbsp; Sermak. You are being superficial. The best men onthe planets\u0026nbsp; of the kingdoms are sent here to\u0026nbsp; the Foundation each year andeducated into the priesthood. And the best of these remain here as researchstudents.\u0026nbsp; If\u0026nbsp; you think\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; those\u0026nbsp; who are\u0026nbsp; left,\u0026nbsp; with practically\u0026nbsp; noknowledge of\u0026nbsp; the elements of science, or\u0026nbsp; worse, still, with the distortedknowledge the\u0026nbsp; priests receive, can penetrate at\u0026nbsp; a bound to nuclear power,to electronics,\u0026nbsp; to the theory of the hyperwarp ? you have a very romanticand very\u0026nbsp; foolish idea\u0026nbsp; of science. It\u0026nbsp; takes lifetimes of\u0026nbsp; training and anexcellent brain to get that far.\"Yohan Lee had risen abruptly during the foregoing speech and left the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0026nbsp; had returned\u0026nbsp; now and\u0026nbsp; when Hardin\u0026nbsp; finished speaking,\u0026nbsp; he bent\u0026nbsp; to hissuperior\u0027s ear.\u0026nbsp; A whisper was exchanged and\u0026nbsp; then a leaden cylinder. Then,with\u0026nbsp; one short\u0026nbsp; hostile\u0026nbsp; look at\u0026nbsp; the deputation,\u0026nbsp; Lee resumed\u0026nbsp; his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin\u0026nbsp; turned\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; cylinder\u0026nbsp; end\u0026nbsp; for\u0026nbsp; end\u0026nbsp; in his\u0026nbsp; hands,\u0026nbsp; watching\u0026nbsp; thedeputation through\u0026nbsp; his lashes. And then\u0026nbsp; he opened it with\u0026nbsp; a hard, suddentwist and only Sermak had the sense not to throw a rapid look at the rolledpaper that fell out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"In short,\u0026nbsp; gentlemen,\" he said, \"the Government is\u0026nbsp; of the opinion that itknows what it is doing.\"He read\u0026nbsp; as he spoke. There\u0026nbsp; were the lines of\u0026nbsp; intricate, meaningless codethat covered\u0026nbsp; the page and the\u0026nbsp; three penciled words scrawled\u0026nbsp; in one comerthat carried the message.\u0026nbsp; He took it in at a glance and tossed it casuallyinto the incinerator shaft.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That,\" Hardin then said, \"ends the interview, I\u0027m afraid. Glad to have metyou all.\u0026nbsp; Thank you\u0026nbsp; for coming.\" He\u0026nbsp; shook hands with\u0026nbsp; each in perfunctoryfashion, and they filed out.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin had almost gotten out of the habit of laughing, but after Sermak andhis three\u0026nbsp; silent partners were well\u0026nbsp; out of earshot, he\u0026nbsp; indulged in a drychuckle and bent an amused look on Lee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did you like that battle of bluffs, Lee?\"Lee snorted\u0026nbsp; grumpily. \"I\u0027m not sure\u0026nbsp; that he\u0026nbsp; was bluffing. Treat him withkid\u0026nbsp; gloves and\u0026nbsp; he\u0027s quite\u0026nbsp; liable to\u0026nbsp; win the\u0026nbsp; next election, just\u0026nbsp; as hesays.\"\"Oh,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; quite\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; likely,\u0026nbsp; quite\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; likely\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; ? if\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; nothing\u0026nbsp; happens\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; first.\"\"Make sure\u0026nbsp; they don\u0027t happen in\u0026nbsp; the wrong direction this\u0026nbsp; time, Hardin. Itell you this Sermak has a following. What if he doesn\u0027t wait till the nextelection? There was a\u0026nbsp; time when you and I put things through violently, inspite of your slogan about what violence is.\"Hardin cocked\u0026nbsp; an eyebrow. \"You are\u0026nbsp; pessimistic today, Lee. And singularlycontrary, too, or you wouldn\u0027t speak of violence. Our own little putsch wascarried\u0026nbsp; through without\u0026nbsp; loss of\u0026nbsp; life, you\u0026nbsp; remember. It was\u0026nbsp; a necessarymeasure\u0026nbsp; put\u0026nbsp; through\u0026nbsp; at\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; proper\u0026nbsp; moment,\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; went\u0026nbsp; over\u0026nbsp; smoothly,painlessly,\u0026nbsp; and all\u0026nbsp; but effortlessly.\u0026nbsp; As for\u0026nbsp; Sermak, he\u0027s up\u0026nbsp; against adifferent proposition. You and\u0026nbsp; I, Lee, aren\u0027t the Encyclopedists. We standprepared. Order\u0026nbsp; your men onto these youngsters in\u0026nbsp; a nice way, old fellow.\n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t let them know they\u0027re being watched ?but eyes open, you understand.\"Lee laughed in sour\u0026nbsp; amusement. \"I\u0027d be a fine one to wait for your orders,wouldn\u0027t I,\u0026nbsp; Hardin? Sermak and his men have\u0026nbsp; been under surveillance for amonth now.\"The\u0026nbsp; mayor chuckled. \"Got\u0026nbsp; in first, did\u0026nbsp; you? All\u0026nbsp; right. By the\u0026nbsp; way,\" heobserved, and\u0026nbsp; added softly, \"Ambassador Verisof\u0026nbsp; is returning to Terminus.\n\u003cbr\u003e Temporarily, I hope.\"There was a short\u0026nbsp; silence, faintly horrified, and then Lee said, \"Was thatthe message? Are things breaking already?\"\"Don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t tell till I hear what Verisof has to say. They may be,though. After\u0026nbsp; all, they have to before election.\u0026nbsp; But what are you lookingso dead about?\"\"Because I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s going to turn out. You\u0027re too deep, Hardin,and you\u0027re playing the game too close to your chest.\"\"Even you?\" murmured Hardin. And aloud, \"Does that mean you\u0027re going tojoin Sermak\u0027s new party?\"Lee smiled against his will. \"All right. You win.
