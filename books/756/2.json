{"id":37286,"no":2,"title":"POSTSCRIPTS TO SECOND EDITION","content":"\u0026nbsp;General Booth signalised the inauguration of his Social Scheme by quarreling with Mr. Frank Smith, who had acted as the chief officer of the Social Wing of the Salvation Army. Mr. Smith felt obliged to resign. From the correspondence which appeared in the newspapers, it seems that the principal ground of his complaint was General Booth’s refusal to keep a separate account of income and expenditure for the Social Scheme. The accounts were to form a part of the general book-keeping of the Army. This was in defiance of the spirit, if not the letter, of Booth’s promises, and Mr. Smith would not connive at what he considered a deception. After his resignation, however, the General declared there had been a misunderstanding, and the accounts would be kept separate. Whether they have been so kept, is a question which outsiders have no means of determining. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (2) General Booth has raised his ￡100,000. He has found, however, that his success in this direction has diverted about ￡10,000 from the ordinary income of the Salvation Army. He does not state—probably he does not know, and perhaps he does, not care—how much he has diverted from the ordinary income of other bodies. Many loud complaints have been raised, which, taken in conjunction with Booth’s own confession, seem to vindicate our contention that there is a certain amount of money available for philanthropical purposes, and that what is gained by one solicitant leaves so much less for division among the rest. Here, as elsewhere, there is a struggle for existence, and the fittest, in the circumstances, survive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (3) Many persons have desired to know how the profits of General Booth’s book have been alloted. It has had a very large sale, and there must have been a considerable sum to be disposed of. Probably a generous remuneration has been received by Mr. Stead, who generally succeeds in reconciling profit with enthusiasm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (4) General Booth declares that he has never derived a penny of profit from the operations of the Salvation Army. This may be literally true, but virtually it must imply a reservation. Booth began as a very poor man. He is now in a more flourishing position. It was reported in the newspapers, a year or two ago, that he had paid ￡4,000 for a new residence. Mr. Bramwell Booth recently lost a considerable sum of money by the failure of a stock-broker. The other members of the Booth family seem to be well provided for. The present writer has seen them travelling first-class when he has been riding third, and they looked fully conscious of their importance as they walked along the platform.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (5) Up to the present the Social Scheme has made no appreciable impression on the poverty and misery of London. General Booth has set up a match-factory, and is now selling Salvation matches. They are said to be worth their price, but it must be remembered that the General gets all his capital for nothing. It will also be obvious that every box of matches he sells will diminish by so much the demand for matches supplied by other firms. He therefore gives employment to one man by taking it away from another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (6) The foreign and the colonial tours of General Booth are a curious illustration of English modesty. It is difficult to understand why the inhabitants of Berlin and Paris should be expected to contribute towards the cost of reclaiming the poor and depraved in London. Every country has its own troubles, and should meet them in its own way. It is worthy of notice, however, that General Booth recognises far less misery in “infidel” Paris than in orthodox London.\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3207/87634.html","bookId":756,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:49:40 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:49:40 AM"}
