Someone else has been-oh, how do you say?-superimposed over this girl.\" Felix pauses, then his eyes move to the Wallaces. \"I assume the same thing happened with this couple,\" he says, squinting at the photo. \"A rather crude job, actually.\" Felix sighs, placing the photo back on the bar. \"But hell, who knows? Maybe you were really drunk and feeling rather friendly so you joined another table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m shaking my head. \"I\u0027d never sit with those people,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Look at that woman\u0027s hair.\" I order an Absolut-and-cranberry from the bartender-with lime, I stress-and when he brings it I drink it quickly, but it totally fails to relax me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I just need to get laid,\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix starts giggling. \"You will.\" He keeps giggling. \"Oh, you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me the giggling, Felix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you read the new draft?\" he\u0027s asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the script keeps changing, Felix,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t think this is what I signed on for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re really not accustomed to disappointment, are you, Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think something bad happened to that girl,\" I\u0027m saying meekly. \"To... Marina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think errors are being made?\" Felix asks, taking a long swallow of brandy, moving one snifter aside for another. \"I think people can know too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just... I just... think there\u0027s been some kind of- oh man-like emergency and...\" My voice trails off. I stare over at the piano player, at the extras sitting at tables, on couches, nodding thoughtfully to the music. \"And...
