He was smitten with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceremony was beautiful. The padre made me weep with the Italian sonnet he added to the ceremony. It was a dream wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my eye but Luce handed me his handkerchief. I loved that he had one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed it back to him but he put a hand up, \"You keep it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled but he got a cocky grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Nothing. It was a beautiful ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe happy couple walked down the aisle and the Texans started to hoot and holler. The groomsmen each took their model on their arm and followed behind them. Mike winked at me as he made his way out of the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi came over, \"Is she pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled as we walked out of the chapel together, \"I don’t know, but you should probably be the last person on earth to judge her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed, \"Who told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrinkled my nose, \"How could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, \"I couldn’t bear the thought of Shawn\u0027s wimpy DNA, okay? If I have a son, which I am having a son, I want a warrior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"Oh my God, Bran. What the fuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say fuck in church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at her belly and tried hard to hide my rage, \"You are despicable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sneered, \"Shawn has his female friends and I have my male friends, and we don’t question each other. As long as the house is clean and the dinner is ordered and the babies are made, I\u0027m free to be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"What about Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly, \"J.D., be serious. No one like him would ever be with someone like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent me here to be with Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a patronizingly-loving look, \"You had already screwed yourself. That ship had sailed. Dad may not talk to me, but honestly, I\u0027m a victim of your circumstances to the rest of society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth hung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a perfectly-manicured finger up and closed my jaw, \"I love you and I want you to be happy. You have never been one of us. Good society has never suited you, J.D. Your name alone says it all. Jacqueline Croix is a beautiful name and you go by J.D. and Jack. You hate your name, first and last. You hate the fact we have arranged marriages and planned lives. I don’t. I have always enjoyed my life. I loved my place in the world. I don’t need to see the art and buildings and the vineyards of the world. I don’t give a shit about some priest who built this dumpy, old castle. It doesn’t even have turrets so he didn’t do a great job.\" She squeezed my arms, \"I love you the way you are. Quirky and complex. I\u0027m a simple person, lots of money, lots of fineries, lots of galas and events. That’s all it takes to make me happy. You have never been that girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sickened, and yet thrilled, by her weird and insulting speech. I nodded, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged me, \"I love you as J.D. and Jack. The girl who can\u0027t just drink the wine; she has to know how it\u0027s made, how old the fucking vineyard is, and which monk made it first. No one actually cares about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain made a funny remark in my head. That wasn’t entirely true. There was someone who cared about that. He was standing under a lemon tree, watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is trouble, by the way. Is he a model?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"No. He\u0027s a hockey player. He plays in Boston too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit, is that the Lucian guy that every girl on the East Coast is in love with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, his family is crazy rich. Old money too. Ambassadors, bankers, and oil money. He is loaded. Too bad he wasn’t the one you picked. Dad never would have had a problem with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at her, \"I need to get a drink.\" My head was spinning. I could still feel my inner thighs begging for Mike to fuck me if I squeezed my legs tight enough, but the dark-green eyes under the lemon tree were taunting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at her, \"Seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, \"A little bit doesn’t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and walked to the bar inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat at the old bar, running my fingers over the ornately-carved wood. The bartender interrupted my appreciation, \"Can I get you something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, without looking at him, \"Red wines, what do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe list was slid in front of my face. I glanced at it and pointed instantly at the Valpolicella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like you could use a goblet of wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my face to see Luce behind the bar, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, \"I\u0027m getting the lady wine.\" He reached for the bottle I had selected and opened it. Watching his hands working the corkscrew was sexy. He didn\u0027t notice my mouth breathing and eye fucking. He was too busy telling me the history of the bottle he was opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The region was known for its method of using dried or partially-dried grape skins in the process. This bottle, in particular, is a Superiore because of the dried skins. The fermentation of the skin is part of the flavor in the wine. It gives it that sour-cherry flavor the wine is known for. Because the region is more North and cooler, the grapes typically are lighter in flavor. The fermented skins make the robust flavors come to life.\" He passed it through an aerator and slid a massive crystal goblet in front of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward, smelling the cherry of the wine and sighed. He poured himself a glass and picked mine up. He walked out behind the bar and through the doors to the veranda out back. He sat us down at one of the lit tents overlooking Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine this was your view every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat across from him, \"Would you ever leave the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"The house yes, the yard maybe no. I love this villa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was setting and the tents were lit and spread across the backyard in amongst the hanging garden. The view of Rome was incredible. The warm air and the smell of my wine and Luce\u0027s subtle cologne, was as if my wish list had been granted. Every item was ticked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the aching guilt in my stomach was something I hadn’t asked for. I felt sick, knowing I had nearly slept with Mike. That was bothering me more than anything. I had misled him. I hated that truth as I faced it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce never spoke, he sipped his wine and looked at the valley below us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was racing. Not from the mistakes I was making, but from the experience I was having. I felt more alive in that moment than I ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and closed my eyes, \"Can you imagine this in the 1700s. The villa, the view, the vino, and the food?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the peaceful smile upon his lips when he spoke, \"I can. I can see all of it. It’s like a Henry James novel or Jane Austen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened an eye, \"You read?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"I was forced to in the beginning, for school. But as I got older, I learned to love reading. I read science fiction and fantasy, like The Lord of the Rings and Stephen King\u0027s The Dark Tower series. I never appreciated Austen until the remake of Pride and Prejudice. I saw it with a girlfriend. She forced me to go, and honestly, I only agreed because the blonde from James Bond, Die Another Day, was in it. She is gorgeous, and of course, Keira Knightly. That changed it for me. The music was a perfect match, Dario Marianelli was the composer who did V for Vendetta. That\u0027s probably one of my favorite movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I\u0027ve never seen it. I loved the music in Pride and Prejudice though. I loved the scene where she was walking in the morning, in the mist and he was there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Yes, exceptional score for certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was no longer at a wedding in Italy. I was on a hillside with a guy who felt like he challenged me and made me think about things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panicked, standing up abruptly, \"I should go find Brandi. Thank you for the glass of wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked confused but nodded, \"See you at dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t. No one did. I ran to my room, packed my bag and called for a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock at the door startled me as I finished grabbing everything. I opened it to find Mike, looking feisty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is going on in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed past me, \"Shit, I thought I\u0027d find Luce in here, and instead, I find something much worse. You\u0027re leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I am leaving before I make a fool of myself. I\u0027m not ready for this, for us. I don’t even understand why I was invited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, closing the door and pulling me into him. \"Jack, don\u0027t piss me off tonight, please. We need to finish what almost happened earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him back, \"No, we don’t. We have done that half a dozen times. We have never needed to talk about it. I actually don’t want to talk about it at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me into him harder, “We never actually did it though.” I closed my eyes and smelled him. He was home and safety and strength, but I needed to find those things on my own. I hugged tightly to him, \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you love torturing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me back and I could see it. I was hurting him. I hated that. He faked a smile, \"Don’t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood on my tiptoes and kissed him softly, \"I love you, forever and always. You\u0027re my best friend, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced, \"Best friend? Is there something going on with you and Luce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"He\u0027s a friend. He was a friend when I needed one and that is all.\" His eyes narrowed, but I put my finger to his lips and smiled, \"Whatever really mean, hateful thing you\u0027re about to say—don’t. Just stop. You always say the shittiest stuff when you don\u0027t get your own way. I\u0027m going back to Greece to finish my two months of work at the vineyard. I will see you in May in Boston or New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my pinkie out. He rolled his eyes and wrapped his massive pinkie around mine and shook them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winked, \"Thanks for the almost booty call.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-28.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
