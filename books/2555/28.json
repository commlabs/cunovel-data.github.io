I lay on the bed for hours trying (and failing) to make sense of everything that\u0027s happening. I must have looked at the alarm clock a hundred times or more in the night. I watched every hour tick by...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dad.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still half-asleep but Ed wakes me up. I sit up quickly. What\u0027s wrong? What\u0027s happened? I rub my eyes and try to focus on my son\u0027s face. The room\u0027s dark but I think he\u0027s okay. I look down and see that Lizzie\u0027s still sleeping next to me in bed. She seems okay too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dad,\u0027 he says again, annoyed that I haven\u0027t answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 I mumble. \u0027Are the others all right?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. What he wants to tell me has obviously got nothing to do with Ellis or Josh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The telly\u0027s bust,\u0027 he grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slump back on my pillow, relieved. Is that all? Thank God for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter with it?\u0027 I ask, struggling to sound interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can\u0027t get a picture.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it plugged in?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 he groans, \u0027I\u0027m not stupid.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too tired to pick him up for being rude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you checked the cables at the back?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I haven\u0027t touched them. It was working yesterday, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What about the telly in your bedroom?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can\u0027t get the channel I want on my telly. Come on Dad, get up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll come and have a look in a couple of minutes,\u0027 I yawn. \u0027Let me stay here for a bit longer...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But my programme\u0027s on now,\u0027 he protests. \u0027Please, Dad.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes for a few seconds longer but it\u0027s obvious that I\u0027m not going to get any peace until Ed\u0027s got the TV fixed. Cursing under my breath I get up and stumble across the cold bedroom floor and down the hallway, side-stepping Harry as I meet him by the kitchen door. Ed follows then pushes past me as we reach the living room. He picks up the remote control and switches on the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027See...\u0027 he says, flicking through the channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit and stare at the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 Harry asks, as he wearily drags himself into the room after us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Telly\u0027s broke,\u0027 Ed tells him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s not broken,\u0027 I say as I flick through the channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you checked the aerial?\u0027 Harry suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with it,\u0027 I tell them both, \u0027look.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry moves around so that he can see the screen. And now he can see why I\u0027ve been staring. It\u0027s the same thing on every channel. A black screen with stark white text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREMAIN CALM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO NOT PANIC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTAKE SHELTER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAIT FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-28.html","bookId":2555,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM"}
