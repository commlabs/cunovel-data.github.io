Anxiety was an unusual emotion for Fords Deep Water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritation was even rarer. However, because Fords Deep Water lived inside a human body, irritation was sometimes inescapable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the whispers of the Healing students buzzed in the far corner of the operation room, his lips pressed together into a tight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression felt out of place on a mouth more often given to smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarren, his regular assistant, saw the grimace and patted his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re just curious, Fords,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An insertion is hardly an interesting or challenging procedure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any soul on the street could perform it in an emergency. There is nothing for them to learn by observing today.\" Fords was surprised to hear the sharp edge marring his normally soothing voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve never seen a grown human before,\" Darren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords raised one eyebrow. \"Are they blind to each other\u0027s faces? Do they not have mirrors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean �C a wild human. Still soulless. One of the insurgents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords looked at the girl\u0027s unconscious body, laid out facedown on the operating table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePity swelled in his heart as he remembered the condition the poor, broken body had been in when the Seekers had brought her to the Heeling facility. Such pain she\u0027d endured��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she was perfect now �C completely healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords had seen to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She looks the same as any of us,\" Fords murmured to Darren. \"We all have human faces. And when she wakes up, she will be one of us, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just exiting for them, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The soul we implant today deserves more respect then to have her host body gawked at this way. She\u0027ll already have far too much to deal with as she acclimates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not fair to put her through this.\" Bythis, he did not mean the gawking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords heard the sharp edge return to his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarren patted him again. \"It will be fine. The Seekers needs information and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the wordSeeker, Fords gave Darren a look that could only be described as a glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarren blinked in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Fords apologized at once. \"I didn\u0027t mean to react so negatively. It\u0027s just that I fear for this soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes moved to the cryotank on its stand beside the table. The light was a steady, dull read, indicating that it was occupied and in hibernation mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This soul was specially picked for the assignment,\" Darren said soothingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is exceptional among our kind �C braver than most. Her lives speak for themselves. I think she would volunteer, if it was possible to ask her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who among us would not volunteer if we were asked to do something for the greater good? But is that really the case here? Is the greater good served by this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The question is not her willingness, but what it is right to ask any soul to bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Healing students were discussing the hibernating soul as well. Fords could hear the whispers clearly: their voices was rising now, getting louder with their excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s lived on six planets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard she never lived two terms as the same host species.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been almost everything. A Flower, a Bear, a Spider-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A See Weed, a Bat-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even a Dragon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it �C not seven planets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least seven. She started at the Orgin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? The Orgin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet, please!\" Fords interrupted. \"If you cannot observe professionally and silently, then I will have to ask you to remove yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbashed, the six students fell silent and edged away from another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go on with this, Darren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was prepared. The appropriate medicines were laid our beside\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human girl. Her long dark hair was secured beneath a surgical cap, exposing her slender neck. Deeply sedated, she breathed slowly in and out. Her sun-browned skin had barely a mark to show for her�� accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Begin thaw sequence now, please, Darren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gray-haired assistant was already waiting beside the cryotank, his hand resting on the dial. He flipped the safety back and spun down the dial. The red light atop the small gray cylinder began to pulse, flashing faster as the seconds passed, changing color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords concentrated on the unconscious body: he edged the scalpel through the skin at the base of the subject\u0027s skull with small, precise movements, and then sprayed the medication that stilled the excess flow of blood before he widened the fissure. Fords delved delicately beneath the neck muscles, careful not to injure them, exposing the pale bones at the top of the spinal column.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The soul is ready, Fords,\" Darren informed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I. Bring her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords felt Darren at his elbow and knew without looking that his assistant would be prepared, his hand stretched out and waiting; they had worked together for many years now. Fords held the gap open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send her home,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarren\u0027s hand moved into view, the silver gleam of an awaking soul in his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords never saw an exposed soul without being struck by the beauty of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soul shone in the brilliant lights of the operating room, brighter than the reflective silver instrument in his hand. Like a living ribbon, she twisted and rippled, stretching, happy to be free of the cryotank. Her thin, feathery attachments, nearly a thousand of them, billowed softly like pale silver hair. Though they were all lovely, this one seemed particularly graceful to Fords Deep Waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not alone in his reaction. He heard Darren\u0027s soft sigh, heard the admiring murmurs of the students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, Darren placed the small glistening creature inside the opening Fords had made in the human\u0027s neck. The soul slid smoothly into the offered space, weaving herself into the alien anatomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords admired the skill with which she possessed her new home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attachments wound tightly into place around the nerve centers, some elongating and reaching deeper to where he couldn\u0027t see, under and up into the brain, the optic nerves, the ear canals. She was very quick, very firm in her movements. Soon, only one small segment of her glistening body was visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done,\" he whispered to her, knowing that she could not hear him. The human girl was the one with ears, and she slept soundly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a routine matter to finish the job. He cleaned and healed the wound, applied the salve that sealed the incision closed behind the soul, and then brushed the scar-softening powder across the line left on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect, as usual,\" said the assistant, who, for some reason unfathomable to Fords, had never made a change from his human host\u0027s name, Darren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords sighted. \"I regret this day\u0027s work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re only doing your duty as a Healer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the rare occasion when Healing creates an injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarren began to clean up the workstation. He didn\u0027t seem to know how to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFords was filling his Calling. That was enough for Darren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not enough for Fords Deep Waters, who was a true Healer to the core of his being. He gazed anxiously at the human female\u0027s body, peaceful in slumber, knowing that this peace would be shattered as soon as she awoke. All the horror of this young girl\u0027s end would be borne by the innocent soul he\u0027d just placed inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he leaned over the human and whispered in her ear, Fords wished fervently that the soul inside could hear him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck, little wanderer, good luck. How I wish you didn\u0027t need it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-1.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
