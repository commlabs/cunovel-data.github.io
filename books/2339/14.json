{"id":65513,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003eBACK AT THE STATION HOUSE THERE WAS A BIG WHITE CADILLAC parked right across the entrance. Brand-new, fully loaded. Full of puffy black leather and fake wood. It looked like a Vegas whorehouse after the stern walnut and old hide in Charlie Hubble\u0027s Bentley. Took me five strides to get around its hood to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside in the chill everybody was milling around a tall old guy with silver hair. He was in an old-fashioned suit. Bootlace tie with a silver clasp. Looked like a real asshole. Some kind of a politician. The Cadillac driver. He must have been about seventy-five years old and he was limping around, leaning on a thick cane with a huge silver knob at the top. I guessed this was Mayor Teale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoscoe was coming out of the big office in back. She had been pretty shaken up after being at the Morrison place. Wasn\u0027t looking too good now, but she waved and tried a smile. Gestured me over. Wanted me to go into the office with her. I took another quick glance at Mayor Teale and walked over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You OK?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had better days,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You up to speed?\" I asked her. \"Finlay give you the spread?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finlay told me everything,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ducked into the big rosewood office. Finlay was sitting at the desk under the old clock. It showed a quarter of four. Roscoe closed the door and I looked back and forth between the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who\u0027s getting it?\" I said. \"Who\u0027s the new chief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay looked up at me from where he was sitting. Shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody,\" he said. \"Mayor Teale is going to run the department himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to the door and cracked it open an inch. Peered out and looked at Teale across the squad room. He had Baker pinned up against the wall. Looked like he was giving him a hard time about something. I watched him for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you make of that?\" I asked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody else in the department is clean,\" Roscoe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks that way, I guess,\" I said. \"But it proves Teale himself is on board. Teale\u0027s their replacement, so Teale\u0027s their boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we know he\u0027s just their boy?\" she said. \"Maybe he\u0027s the big boss. Maybe he\u0027s running the whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"The big boss had Morrison carved up as a message. If Teale was the big boss, why would he send a message to himself? He belongs to somebody. He\u0027s been put in here to run interference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s for sure,\" Finlay said. \"Started already. Told us Joe and Stoller are going on the back burner. We\u0027re throwing everything at the Morrison thing. Doing it ourselves, no outside help, no FBI, no nothing. He says the pride of the department is at stake. And he\u0027s already driving us up a blind alley. Says it\u0027s obvious Morrison was killed by somebody just out of prison. Somebody Morrison himself put away a long time ago, out for revenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s a hell of a blind alley,\" Roscoe said. \"We\u0027ve got to trawl through twenty years of old files and cross-check every name in every file against parole records from across the entire country. It could take us months. He\u0027s pulled Ste venson in off the road for it. Until this is over, he drives a desk. So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s worse than a blind alley,\" Finlay said. \"It\u0027s a coded warning. Nobody in our files looks good for violent revenge. Never had that sort of crime here. We know that. And Teale knows we know that. But we can\u0027t call his bluff, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you just ignore him?\" I said. \"Just do what needs doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back in his chair. Blew a sigh at the ceiling and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"We\u0027re working right under the enemy\u0027s nose. Right now, Teale\u0027s got no reason to think we know anything about any of this. And we\u0027ve got to keep it that way. We\u0027ve got to play dumb and act innocent, right? That\u0027s going to limit our scope. But the big problem is authorization. If I need a warrant or something, I\u0027m going to need his signature. And I\u0027m not going to get it, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not planning on using warrants,\" I said. \"Did you call Washington?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re getting back to me,\" he said. \"Just hope Teale doesn\u0027t grab the phone before I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you need is somewhere else to work,\" I said. \"What about that buddy of yours up in Atlanta FBI? The one you told me about? Could you use his office as a kind of private facility?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay thought about it. Nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bad idea,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to go off the record. I can\u0027t ask Teale to make a formal request, right? I\u0027ll call from home, tonight. Guy called Picard. Nice guy, you\u0027ll like him. He\u0027s from the Quarter, down in New Orleans. He did a spell in Boston about a million years ago. Great big guy, very smart, very tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him we need it kept very quiet,\" I said. \"We don\u0027t want his agents down here until we\u0027re ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do about Teale?\" Roscoe asked me. \"He works for the guys who killed your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends how involved he was,\" I said. \"He wasn\u0027t the shooter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t?\" Roscoe said. \"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not fast enough,\" I said. \"Limps around with a cane in his hand. Too slow to pull a gun. Too slow to get Joe, anyway. He wasn\u0027t the kicker, either. Too old, not vigorous enough. And he wasn\u0027t the gofer. That was Morrison. But if he starts messing with me, then he\u0027s in deep shit. Otherwise, to hell with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what now?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged at her. Didn\u0027t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Sunday is the thing,\" Finlay said. \"Sunday is going to solve some kind of a problem for them. Teale being put in here feels so temporary, you know? The guy\u0027s seventy-five years old. He\u0027s got no police experience. It\u0027s a temporary fix, to get them through until Sunday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buzzer on the desk went off. Stevenson\u0027s voice came over the intercom asking for Roscoe. They had files to check. I opened the door for her. But she stopped. She\u0027d just thought of something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Spivey?\" she said. \"Over at Warburton? He was ordered to arrange the attack on Hubble, right? So he must know who gave him the order. You should go ask him. Might lead somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. Closed the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waste of time,\" Finlay said to me. \"You think Spivey\u0027s just going to tell you a thing like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he knows, he\u0027ll tell me,\" I said to him. \"A question like that, it\u0027s how you ask it, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care, Reacher,\" he said. \"They see you getting close to what Hubble knew, they\u0027ll waste you like they wasted him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie and her kids flashed into my mind and I shivered. They would figure Charlie was close to what Hubble had known. That was inevitable. Maybe even his kids as well. A cautious person would assume kids could have overheard something. It was four o\u0027clock. The kids would be out of school. There were people out there who had loaded up with rubber overshoes, nylon bodysuits and surgical gloves. And sharp knives. And a bag of nails. And a hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finlay, call your buddy Picard right now,\" I said. \"We need his help. We\u0027ve got to put Charlie Hubble somewhere safe. And her kids. Right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay nodded gravely. He saw it. He understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For sure,\" he said. \"Get your ass up to Beckman. Right now. Stay there. I\u0027ll organize Picard. You don\u0027t leave until he shows up, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the phone. Dialed an Atlanta number from memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROSCOE WAS BACK AT HER DESK. MAYOR TEALE WAS HANDING her a thick wad of file folders. I stepped over to her and pulled up a spare chair. Sat down next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time do you finish?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About six, I guess,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring some handcuffs home, OK?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a fool, Jack Reacher,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeale was watching so I got up and kissed her hair. Went out into the afternoon and headed for the Bentley. The sun was dropping away and the heat was gone. Shadows were lengthening up. Felt like the fall was on its way. Behind me I heard a shout. Mayor Teale had followed me out of the building. He called me back. I stayed where I was. Made him come to me. He limped over, tapping his cane, smiling. Stuck out his hand and introduced himself. Said his name was Grover Teale. He had that politician\u0027s knack of fixing you with a look and a smile like a searchlight. Like he was thrilled to bits just to be talking to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad I caught you,\" he said. \"Sergeant Baker has brought me up to date on the warehouse homicides. It all seems pretty clear to me. We made a clumsy mistake in apprehending you, and we\u0027re all very sorry indeed about your brother, and we\u0027ll certainly let you know just as soon as we get to any conclusions. So before you get on your way, I\u0027d be grateful if you\u0027d kindly accept my apology on behalf of this department. I wouldn\u0027t want you to take away a bad impression of us. May we just call it a mistake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, Teale,\" I said. \"But why do you assume I\u0027m leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came back smoothly. Not more than a tiny hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understood you were just passing through,\" he said. \"We have no hotel here in Margrave and I imagined you would find no opportunity to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m staying,\" I said. \"I received a generous offer of hospitality. I understand that\u0027s what the South is famous for, right? Hospitality?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beamed at me and grasped his embroidered lapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, undoubtedly that\u0027s true, sir,\" he said. \"The South as a whole, and Georgia in particular, is indeed famous for the warmth of its welcome. However, as you know, just at the present time, we find ourselves in a most awkward predicament. In the circumstances, a motel in Atlanta or Macon would really suit you much better. Naturally, we would keep in close touch, and we would extend you every assistance in arranging your brother\u0027s funeral, when that sad time comes. Here in Margrave, I\u0027m afraid, we\u0027re all going to be very busy. It\u0027ll be boring for you. Officer Roscoe\u0027s going to have a lot of work to do. She shouldn\u0027t be distracted just at the moment, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t distract her,\" I said evenly. \"I know she\u0027s doing vital work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. An expressionless gaze. Eye to eye, but he wasn\u0027t really tall enough. He\u0027d get a crick in his scrawny old neck. And if he kept on staring at me like that, he\u0027d get his scrawny old neck broken. I gave him a wintry smile and stepped away to the Bentley. Unlocked it and got in. Gunned the big motor and whirred the window down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you later, Teale,\" I called as I drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END OF THE SCHOOL DAY WAS THE BUSIEST I\u0027D EVER seen the town. I passed two people on Main Street and saw another four in a knot near the church. Some kind of an afternoon club, maybe. Reading the Bible or bottling peaches for the winter. I drove past them and hustled the big car up the sumptuous mile of Beckman Drive. Turned in at the Hubbles\u0027 white mailbox and spun the old Bakelite steering wheel through the driveway curves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with trying to warn Charlie was I didn\u0027t know how much I wanted to tell her. Certainly I wasn\u0027t about to give her the details. Didn\u0027t even feel right to tell her Hubble was dead at all. We were stuck in some kind of a limbo. But I couldn\u0027t keep her in the dark forever. She needed to know some context. Or else she wouldn\u0027t listen to the warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked her car at her door and rang her bell. The children dashed around from somewhere as Charlie opened up and let me in. She was looking pretty tired and strained. The children looked happy enough. They hadn\u0027t picked up on their mother\u0027s worries. She chased them off and I followed her back to the kitchen. It was a big, modern room. I got her to make me some coffee. I could see she was anxious to talk, but she was having trouble getting started. I watched her fiddling with the filter machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have a maid?\" I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want one,\" she said. \"I like to do things myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a big house,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to keep busy, I guess,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we were silent. Charlie switched on the coffee machine and it started with a faint hiss. I sat at a table in a window nook. It overlooked an acre of velvet lawn. She came and sat opposite me. Folded her hands in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard about the Morrisons,\" she said at last. \"Is my husband involved in all of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to think exactly what I could say to her. She waited for an answer. The coffee machine burbled away in the big silent kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Charlie,\" I said. \"I\u0027m afraid he was. But he didn\u0027t want to be involved, OK? Some kind of blackmail was going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took it well. She must have figured it out for herself, anyway. Must have run every possible speculation through her head. This explanation was the one which fit. That was why she didn\u0027t look surprised or outraged. She just nodded. Then she relaxed. She looked like it had done her good to hear someone else say it. Now it was out in the open. It was acknowledged. It could be dealt with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid that makes sense,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up to pour the coffee. Kept talking as she went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the only way I can explain his behavior,\" she said. \"Is he in danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie, I\u0027m afraid I have no idea where he is,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed me a mug of coffee. Sat down again on the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he in danger?\" she asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t answer. Couldn\u0027t get any words out. She moved off the counter and came to sit opposite me again at the table in the window. She cradled her cup in front of her. She was a fine-looking woman. Blond and pretty. Perfect teeth, good bones, slim, athletic. A lot of spirit. I had seen her as a plantation type. What they call a belle. I had said to myself that a hundred and fifty years ago she would have been a slave owner. I began to change that opinion. I felt a crackle of toughness coming from her. She enjoyed being rich and idle, sure. Beauty parlors and lunch with the girls in Atlanta. The Bentley and the gold cards. The big kitchen which cost more than I ever made in a year. But if it came to it, here was a woman who might get down in the dirt and fight. Maybe a hundred and fifty years ago she would have been on a wagon train heading west. She had enough spirit. She looked hard at me across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I panicked this morning,\" she said. \"That\u0027s not really like me at all. I must have given you a very bad impression, I\u0027m afraid. After you left, I calmed down and thought things out. I came to the same conclusion you\u0027ve just described. Hub\u0027s blundered into something and he\u0027s got all tangled up in it. So what am I going to do about it? Well, I\u0027m going to stop panicking and start thinking. I\u0027ve been a mess since Friday and I\u0027m ashamed of it. That\u0027s not the real me at all. So I did something, and I hope you\u0027ll forgive me for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called Dwight Stevenson,\" she said. \"He had mentioned he had seen a fax from the Pentagon about your service as a military policeman. I asked him to find it and read it to me. I thought it was an excellent record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at me. Hitched her chair in closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what I want to do is to hire you,\" she said. \"I want to hire you in a private capacity to solve my husband\u0027s problem. Would you consider doing that for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t do that, Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t or won\u0027t?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There would be a sort of a conflict of interest,\" I said. \"It might mean I couldn\u0027t do a proper job for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A conflict?\" she said. \"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused for a long moment. Tried to figure out how to explain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband felt bad, OK?\" I said. \"He got hold of some kind of an investigator, a government guy, and they were trying to fix the situation. But the government guy got killed. And I\u0027m afraid my interest is in the government guy, more than your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed what I was saying and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" she asked. \"You don\u0027t work for the government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The government guy was my brother,\" I told her. \"Just a crazy coincidence, I know, but I\u0027m stuck with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went quiet. She saw where the conflict could lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very sorry,\" she said. \"You\u0027re not saying Hub betrayed your brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the very last thing he would have done. He was depending on him to get him out from under. Something went wrong, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask you a question?\" she said. \"Why do you refer to my husband in the past tense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked straight at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s dead,\" I said. \"I\u0027m very sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie hung in there. She went pale and clenched her hands until her knuckles shone waxy white. But she didn\u0027t fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s dead,\" she whispered. \"I would know. I would be able to feel it. I think he\u0027s just hiding out somewhere. I want you to find him. I\u0027ll pay you whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just slowly shook my head at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t do it, Charlie,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t take your money for that. I would be exploiting you. I can\u0027t take your money because I know he\u0027s already dead. I\u0027m very sorry, but there it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence in the kitchen. I sat there at the table, nursing the coffee she\u0027d made for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you do it if I didn\u0027t pay you?\" she said. \"Maybe you could just look around for him while you find out about your brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. Couldn\u0027t see how I could say no to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll do that, Charlie. But like I say, don\u0027t expect miracles. I think we\u0027re looking at something very bad here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s alive,\" she said. \"I would know if he wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started worrying about what would happen when his body was found. She was going to come face to face with reality the same way a runaway truck comes face to face with the side of a building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need expense money,\" Charlie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure about taking it, but she passed me a thick envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will that do?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked in the envelope. There was a thick wad of hundred dollar bills in there. I nodded. That would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And please keep the car,\" she said. \"Use it as long as you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again. Thought about what else I needed to say and forced myself to use the present tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does he work?\" I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sunrise International,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reeled off an Atlanta address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, Charlie,\" I said. \"Now let me ask you something else. It\u0027s very important. Did your husband ever use the word \u0027Pluribus\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about it and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pluribus?\" she said. \"Isn\u0027t that something to do with politics? Like on the podium when the president gives a speech? I never heard Hub talking about it. He graduated in banking studies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never heard him use that word?\" I asked her again. \"Not on the phone, not in his sleep or anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about next Sunday?\" I asked her. \"Did he mention next Sunday? Anything about what\u0027s going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next Sunday?\" she repeated. \"I don\u0027t think he mentioned it. Why? What\u0027s going to happen next Sunday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pondered it again for a long moment, but just shook her head and shrugged, palms upward, like it meant nothing to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" I said. \"Now you\u0027ve got to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I have to do?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to get out of here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knuckles were still white, but she was staying in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to run and hide?\" she said. \"But where to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An FBI agent is coming here to pick you up,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me in panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FBI?\" she said. She went paler still. \"This is really serious, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s deadly serious,\" I said. \"You need to get ready to leave right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said, slowly. \"I can\u0027t believe this is happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WALKED OUT OF HER KITCHEN AND INTO THE GARDEN room where we had drunk iced tea the day before. Stepped through the French doors and strolled a slow circuit outside the house. Down the driveway, through the banks of greenery, out onto Beckman Drive. Leaned up on the white mailbox on the shoulder. It was silent. I could hear nothing at all except the dry rustle of the grass cooling under my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I could hear a car coming west out of town. It slowed just before the crest of the rise and I heard the automatic box slur a change down as the speed dropped. The car rose up over the crest into view. It was a brown Buick, very plain, two guys in it. They were small dark guys, Hispanic, loud shirts. They were slowing, drifting to the left of the road, looking for the Hubble mailbox. I was leaning on the Hubble mailbox, looking at them. Their eyes met mine. The car accelerated again and swerved away. Blasted on into the empty peach country. I stepped out and watched them go. I saw a dust plume rising as they drove off Margrave\u0027s immaculate blacktop onto the dusty rural roadway. Then I sprinted back up to the house. I wanted Charlie to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was inside, flustered, chattering away like a kid going on vacation. Making lists out loud. Some kind of a mechanism to burn off the panic she was feeling. On Friday she\u0027d been a rich idle woman married to a banker. Now on Monday a stranger who said the banker was dead was telling her to hurry up and run for her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the mobile phone with you,\" I called to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t reply. I just heard a worried silence. Footsteps and closet doors banging. I sat in her kitchen with the rest of the coffee for most of an hour. Then I heard a car horn blow and the crunch of heavy steps on the gravel. A loud knock on the front door. I put my hand in my pocket and closed it around the ebony handle of Morrison\u0027s switchblade. Walked out into the hallway and opened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a neat blue sedan next to the Bentley and a gigantic black guy standing back from the doorstep. He was as tall as me, maybe even taller, but he must have outweighed me by at least a hundred pounds. Must have been three ten, three twenty. Next to him, I was a featherweight. He stepped forward with the easy elastic grace of an athlete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reacher?\" the giant said. \"Pleased to meet you. I\u0027m Picard, FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook hands with me. He was enormous. He had a casual competence about him which made me glad he was on my side. He looked like my type of a guy. Like he could be very useful in a tight corner. I suddenly felt a flood of encouragement. I stood aside to let him into Charlie\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Picard said to me. \"I got all the details from Finlay. Real sorry about your brother, my friend. Real sorry. Somewhere we can talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led him through to the kitchen. He loped beside me and covered the distance in a couple of strides. Glanced around and poured himself the dregs of the stewed coffee. Then he stepped over next to me and dropped his hand on my shoulder. Felt like somebody had hit me with a bag of cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ground rules,\" he said. \"This whole thing is off the record, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. His voice matched his bulk. It was a low rumble. It was what a brown bear would sound like if it learned to talk. I couldn\u0027t tell how old the guy was. He was one of those big fit men whose peak years stretch on for decades. He nodded and moved away. Rested his giant frame against the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a huge problem for me,\" he said. \"Bureau can\u0027t act without a call from the responsible official in the local jurisdiction. That would be this guy Teale, right? And from what Finlay tells me, I assume old Teale\u0027s not going to be making that call. So I could end up with my big ass in a sling for this. But I\u0027ll bend the rules for Finlay. We go back quite a ways. But you got to remember, this is all unofficial, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again. I was happy with that. Very happy. Unofficial help suited me fine. It would get the job done without hanging me up on procedure. I had five clear days before Sunday. This morning, five days had seemed more than generous. But now, with Hubble gone, I felt like I was very short of time. Much too short of time to waste any of it on procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going to put them?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe house up in Atlanta,\" Picard said. \"Bureau place, we\u0027ve had it for years. They\u0027ll be secure there, but I\u0027m not going to say exactly where it is, and I\u0027m going to have to ask you not to press Mrs. Hubble about it afterward, OK? I got to watch my back on this thing. I blow a safe house, I\u0027m in really deep shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, Picard,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t cause you any problems. And I appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, gravely, like he was way out on a limb. Then Charlie and the kids burst in. They were burdened down with badly packed bags. Picard introduced himself. I could see that Charlie\u0027s daughter was terrified by the size of the guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy\u0027s eyes grew round as he gazed at the FBI Special Agent\u0027s shield Picard was holding out. Then the five of us carried the bags outside and piled them in the blue sedan\u0027s trunk. I shook hands with Picard and Charlie. Then they all got in the car. Picard drove them away. I waved after them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1/page-14.html","bookId":2339,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:04 AM"}
