Jasmine\u0027s gasp confirmed my many realizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two placentas,\" said Veronica, pausing and typing something one-handed while still keeping hold of the paddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ... what\u0027s that mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means they could be identical or fraternal,\" said Dr. Sartori. \"One placenta would be identical for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. The noise, that wavelike sound ... It was drowning me. My heartbeat, another heartbeat, and another still ... How was it possible? How could there be so much life in one body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you still do the test?\" I stammered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Sartori was holding the needle but made no moves as his eyes flicked back to the monitor. \"I can ... but it\u0027s not recommended in this situation. With twins, the risks are increased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" I said firmly. \"I still want it. I have to know. With my family history ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI prayed he wouldn\u0027t demand too many details beyond what Dr. Moore had sent over. He and Veronica discussed a few things, using medical language I couldn\u0027t follow. She used the paddle to check every angle, taking measurements on her computer as he occasionally pointed details out. Finally, after another warning against the procedure, he agreed to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt as much as you\u0027d expect from a giant needle being stuck into you. His hands were superhumanly steady, as his eyes held firm to the monitor so he could watch the needle\u0027s progress. I still couldn\u0027t make out much in the images but knew the challenge was to get to the placenta without touching a fetus. Placentas, in this case. They had to get another test kit, using another needle in order to sample from both babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBabies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still couldn\u0027t believe it. They helped me when they finished the test, loading Jasmine and me up with post-care instructions to reduce both self-injury and the risk of miscarriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes it matter? I thought bleakly. A miscarriage would take the decision away from me. It\u0027d be out of my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, one tiny problem did present itself: getting home. I was sore and didn\u0027t feel like driving. In fact, I\u0027d been advised not to. Jasmine helpfully offered to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know for a fact you don\u0027t have a license,\" I told her. I was leaning against my car, baking in welcome sunshine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I can drive. Come on, it\u0027s not that far. And you certainly can\u0027t. What do you want to do? Call Tim and let him know what\u0027s going on?\" she challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted my mom, I realized. I wanted my mom to come and drive me home - to her home. I wanted her to take care of me and talk to me like she used to. I wanted her to fix all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked rapidly and turned my head, not wanting Jasmine to see me tear up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" I held out the keys. \"If we get pulled over, the ticket\u0027s coming out of your allowance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her credit, she drove responsibly, and she was right - it wasn\u0027t far. I tilted my seat back slightly, wanting to sleep for the next few days or however long it would take to get back my results. I didn\u0027t want to endure the waiting. I couldn\u0027t endure the waiting. The car\u0027s silence and rhythm nearly took me under until Jasmine spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"If they\u0027re boys, you get an abortion. If they\u0027re girls ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I don\u0027t.\" I hadn\u0027t realized I\u0027d made my decision until that moment. When I\u0027d heard those heartbeats ... well, it didn\u0027t matter if motherhood and drastic body changes scared the hell out of me. If I had two daughters, daughters unconnected to any prophecy, I would have them. I\u0027d figure parenting out. \"If they\u0027re girls, I\u0027ll keep them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and said nothing more until we were turning down my street. Honestly, I was surprised she waited that long because I\u0027d already known what else she was dying to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Jasmine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do if one\u0027s a boy and one\u0027s a girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared ahead at my house. I suddenly didn\u0027t want to sleep just for the next few days. I wanted to sleep for the next nine months. Or seven months. Or whatever. I didn\u0027t answer her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t have a son,\" I said at last. \"You know that. That\u0027s all there is to it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-22.html","bookId":2040,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM"}
