Vimes peered at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clarence, isn\u0027t it?” he said. “With a C. Well, Clarence with a C, watch my lips. Either you can be charged with Aiding and Abetting or-” he leaned closer, and glanced meaningfully at Carrot-“with an axe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swivel on that one, doggybag!” added Nobby, jumping from one foot to the other in vicious excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClarence\u0027s little piggy eyes glared at the looming bulk that was Carrot, and then at Vimes\u0027s face. There was absolutely no mercy there. He appeared to reach a reluctant decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jolly good,” said Vimes. “Lock them in the gatehouse, Sergeant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon drew his bow and squared his shoulders. “You heard the Man,” he rasped. “One false move and you\u0027re . . . you\u0027re-” he took a desperate stab at it-“you\u0027re Home Economics!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah! Slam \u0027em up in the banger!” shouted Nobby. If worms could turn, Nobby was revolving at generating speeds. “Doucheballs!” he sneered, at their retreating backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aiding and Abetting what, Captain?” said Carrot, as the weaponless guards trooped away. “You have to aid and abet something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think in this case it will just be generalised abetting,” said Vimes. “Persistent and reckless abetment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” said Nobby. “Can\u0027t stand abettors. Slime-breaths!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon handed Captain Vimes the guardhouse key. “It\u0027s not very secure in there, Captain,” he said. “They\u0027ll be able to break out eventually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope so,” said Vimes, “because the very first drain we come to, you\u0027re going to drop the key down it. Everyone here? Right. Follow me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupine Wonse scurried along the ruined corridors of the palace, The Summoning of Dragons under one arm,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe glittering royal sword grasped uncertainly in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe halted, panting, in a doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a lot of his mind was currently in a state sane enough to have proper thoughts, but the small part that was still in business kept insisting that it couldn\u0027t have seen what it had seen or heard what it had heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027d seen Vetinari walking through the palace. He knew the man was securely put away. The lock was completely unpickable. He remembered the Patrician being absolutely insistent that it be an unpickable lock when it was installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was movement in the shadows at the end of the passage. Wonse gibbered a bit, fumbled with the doorhandle beside him, darted in, slammed the door and leaned against it, fighting for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the old private audience room. The Patrician was sitting in his old seat, one leg crossed on the other, watching him with mild interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Wonse,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse jumped, scrabbled at the doorhandle, leapt into the corridor and ran for it until he reached the main staircase, rising now through the ruins of the central palace like a forlorn corkscrew. Stairs-height-high ground-defence. He ran up them three at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he needed was a few minutes of peace. Then he\u0027d show them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upper floors were more full of shadows. What they were short on was structural strength. Pillars and walls had been torn out by the dragon as it built its cave. Rooms gaped pathetically on the edge of the abyss. Dangling shreds of wall-hanging and carpet flapped in the wind from the smashed windows. The floor sprang and wobbled like a trampoline as Wonse scurried across it. He struggled to the nearest door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was commendably fast,” said the Patrician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse slammed the door in his face and ran, squeaking, down a corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanity took a brief hold. He paused by a statue. There was no sound, no hurrying footsteps, no whirr of hidden doors. He gave the statue a suspicious look and prodded it with the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it failed to move he opened the nearest door and slammed it behind him, found a chair and wedged it under the handle. This was one of the upper state rooms, bare now of most of its furnishings, and lacking its fourth wall. Where it should have been was just the gulf of the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician stepped out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now you have got it out of your system-” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse spun around, sword raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t really exist,” he said. “You\u0027re a-a ghost, or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe this is not the case,” said the Patrician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can\u0027t stop me! I’ve got some magic stuff left, I\u0027ve got the book!” Wonse took a brown leather bag out of his pocket. “I\u0027ll bring back another one! You\u0027ll see!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I urge you not to,” said Lord Vetinari mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you think you\u0027re so clever, so in-control, so swave, just because I\u0027ve got a sword and you haven\u0027t! Well, I\u0027ve got more than that, I\u0027ll have you know,” said Wonse triumphantly. “Yes! I\u0027ve got the palace guards on my side! They follow me, not you! No-one likes you, you know. No-one ever liked you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung the sword so that its needle point was a foot from the Patrician\u0027s thin chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So it\u0027s back to the cells for you,” he said. “And this time I\u0027ll make sure you stay there. Guards! Guards!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the clatter of running feet outside. The door rattled, the chair shook. There was a moment\u0027s silence, and then door and chair erupted in splinters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take him away!” screamed Wonse. “Fetch more scorpions! Put him in ... you\u0027re not the-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put the sword down,” said Vimes, while behind him Carrot picked bits of door out of his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” said Nobby, peering around the captain. “Up against the wall and spread \u0027em, motherbreath!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh? What\u0027s he supposed to spread?” whispered Sergeant Colon anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby shrugged. “Dunno,” he said. “Everything, I reckon. Safest way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse stared at the rank in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Vimes,” said the Patrician. “You will-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” said Vimes calmly. “Lance-constable Carrot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Read the prisoner his rights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.” Carrot produced his notebook, licked his thumb, flicked through the pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lupine Wonse,” he said, “AKA Lupin Squiggle Sec\u0027y PP-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wha?” said Wonse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-currently domiciled in the domicile known as The Palace, Ankh-Morpork, it is my duty to inform you that you have been arrested and will be charged with-” Carrot gave Vimes an agonised look-“a number of offences of murder by means of a blunt instrument, to whit, a dragon, and many further offences of generalised abetting, to be more specifically ascertained later. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right not to be summarily thrown into a piranha tank. You have the right to trial by ordeal. You have the-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is madness,” said the Patrician calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I told you to shut up!” snapped Vimes, spinning around and shaking a finger under the Patrician\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me, Sarge,” whispered Nobby, “do you think we\u0027re going to like it in the scorpion pit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-say anything, er, but anything you do say will be written down, er, here, in my notebook, and, er, may be used in evidence-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot\u0027s voice trailed into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if this pantomime gives you any pleasure, Vimes,” said the Patrician eventually, “take him down to the cells. I\u0027ll deal with him in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse made no signal. There was no scream or cry. He just rushed at the Patrician, sword raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOptions flickered across Vimes\u0027s mind. In the lead came the suggestion that standing back would be a good plan, let Wonse do it, disarm him afterwards, let the city clean itself up. Yes. A good plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was therefore a total mystery to him why he chose to dart forward, bringing Carrot\u0027s sword up in a half-baked attempt at blocking the stroke . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was something to do with doing it by the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a clang. Not a particularly loud one. He felt something bright and silver whirr past his ear and strike the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse\u0027s mouth fell open. He dropped the remnant of his sword and backed away, clutching The Summoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ll be sorry,” he hissed. “You\u0027ll all be very sorry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to mumble under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes felt himself trembling. He was pretty certain he knew what had zinged past his head, and the mere thought was making his hands sweat. He\u0027d come to the palace ready to kill and there\u0027d been this minute, just this minute, when for once the world had seemed to be operating properly and he was in charge of it and now, now all he wanted was a drink. And a nice week\u0027s sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, give up!” he said. “Are you going to come quietly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mumbling went on. The air began to feel hot and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes shrugged. “That\u0027s it, then,” he said, and turned away. “Throw the book at him, Carrot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes remembered too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwarfs have trouble with metaphors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey also have a very good aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Laws and Ordinances of Ankh and Morpork caught the secretary on the forehead. He blinked, staggered, and stepped backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the longest step he ever took. For one thing, it lasted the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several seconds they heard him hit, five storeys below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several more seconds their faces appeared over the edge of the ravaged floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a way to go,” said Sergeant Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s a fact,” said Nobby, reaching up to his ear for a dog-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Killed by a wossname. A metaphor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dunno,” said Nobby. “Looks like the ground to me. Got a light, Sarge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was right, wasn\u0027t it, sir?” said Carrot anxiously. “You said to-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes,” said Vimes. “Don\u0027t worry.” He reached down with a shaking hand, picked up the bag Wonse had been holding, and tipped out a pile of stones. Every one had a hole in it. Why? he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA metallic noise behind him made him look around. The Patrician was holding the remains of the royal sword. As the captain watched, the man wrenched the other half of the sword out of the far wall. It was a clean break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Vimes,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sword, if you please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes handed it over. He couldn\u0027t, right now, think of anything else to do. He was probably due for a scorpion pit of his very own as it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Vetinari examined the rusty blade carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long have you had this, Captain?” he said mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn\u0027t mine, sir. Belongs to Lance-constable Carrot, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lance-?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, sir, your graciousness,” said Carrot, saluting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician turned the blade over and over slowly, staring at it as if fascinated. Vimes felt the air thicken, as though history was clustering around this point, but for the life of him he couldn\u0027t think why. This was one of those points where the Trousers of Time bifurcated themselves, and if you weren\u0027t careful you\u0027d go down the wrong leg-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse arose in a world of shades, icy confusion pouring into his mind. But all he could think of at the moment was the tall cowled figure standing over him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-48.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
