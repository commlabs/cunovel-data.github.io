{"id":93562,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 67\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Coven was up in arms. Forsyth Llewellyn had disappeared. Kidnapped by the Croatan? Or was he Croatan himself. Who knew who they could trust anymore? Mimi wondered why he had been so keen on their bonding. Had it truly been for the sake of the Coven, or was it something else? Had he known what was hidden under the church?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the Conclave was in shambles. This was the end of everything, silver Bloods in the church! At a bonding! It was madness, inexcusable. There would have to be meetings to discuss what must be done. More and more meetings, and proper investigations, and no decisions made. They were frightened and leaderless. Mimi understood that the Coven needed her and Jack now more than ever. More even than yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe church had survived the attack intact, except for a fine black dust that covered every surface. As Mimi walked through its doors the next morning at dawn, she was glad, in a way, that she and Jack would be alone for the ceremony this time. Because their bonding was not just about the two of them, but the survival of their people. It was their duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a simple T-shirt and jeans. There would be no society photographers this time, no honored guests. It would be just as it had been in the early days of Rome. There would be no witnesses to their bonding, but they needed none. All they needed was to say the words to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was their fate and this was their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked to the front of the altar and lit a candle. Jack wouldn\u0027t be long. They had shared a cab to the church, but he had asked her to wait for him inside while he took a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as the minutes ticked by and Jack did not walk through the church door, Mimi understood. He would never walk through the door. He had lied to her yet again, because he was not worthy of her. He would never be worthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot like... but she could not say his name aloud. Kingsley. All that could have been flashed in Mimi\u0027s mind: the two of them hunting Silver Bloods together... a life of danger and adventure... a chance for her to be herself again....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone vibrated. It was a text from her brother. It said two words: \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi blew out the flame. There was no need for it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. She was right. Jack had forsaken her to be with the half-blood. He would not honor their celestial bond. He would not do his duty. She had sacrificed her love, but he would not sacrifice his. He had cast his lot to the winds, tempting fate, death, rebelling against the laws of Heaven and the laws of their blood bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would never forgive him for that. She could have left for Paris when Kingsley had asked. She could have chosen happiness as well. But she had not. She had made her decision too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Code of the Vampires decreed that anyone who violated the Sacred Law was condemned to death, the blood burning. Charles had refused to subject Allegra to the sentence. But Mimi was a different matter. Mimi walked out of the church, knowing that if she ever saw Jack again, she would have to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 68\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bliss woke up the day after Mimi\u0027s bonding, she was lying in a comfortable bed under a patchwork quilt. Across from her sat an ordinary woman with ruddy cheeks and a quizzical expression, wearing a worn cashmere sweater and a wool argyle skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Murray?\" Bliss asked. What was her history teacher doing sitting across from her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had a hard time of it, love. Take it easy; don\u0027t exert yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was small and cozy, and Bliss realized this was the entire apartment. She had never been in a space quite so small. It was the size of a closet, practically. There was room for a bed and a stove and nothing more. If Bliss wanted to exert herself, she could cook dinner while lying in bed at the same time. But even though it was small, it was warm and comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I... \" What happened? Where\u0027s... \"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"shhh,\" Miss Murray said, putting a finger to her lips. \"You should rest. She\u0027ll be here soon. She wants to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who... \"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman appeared out of the air. She was fair-haired and green-eyed, clad in white raiment that glowed softly with a pure white light. As soon as Bliss saw her, she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegra,\" she breathed. \"It is you, isn\u0027t it? Where am I? Am I dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllegra Van Alen smiled serenely. She looked a lot older than Bliss remembered from the hospital. The woman in the bed had seemed frozen in time, but this Allegra, standing in front of her, had lines on her face, and her hands were wrinkled. There was gray in her blond hair. But she was still very beautiful. Seeing her made Bliss want to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come,\" Allegra said, holding out her arms. \"Come here, my daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s true,\" Bliss whispered. \"I am yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry I have not been here for you, but your existence was hidden from me for a very long time,\" she said, and the sadness in her voice was unmistakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came to visit me not too long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Bliss nodded. She remembered that surreptitious visit to the hospital, while Allegra remained immobile in her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you came to see me, I felt a presence I had not felt in a very long time. I was very afraid and I was very angry. I screamed. I think the whole hospital heard me. But now I understand that Charles and Lawrence did what they felt they had to. They did it for love, and sometimes love makes us do the irrational... even the inexcusable. But I don\u0027t know if I will ever forgive them for what they tried to do to you,\" Allegra said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss curled her fists up in the quilt. She had a mother, but she had also been robbed of one. \"So Lucifer did not lie to me,\" she said stonily. She felt conflicted and agonized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he did not. You are ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how, how?, you were bound to Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllegra nodded. \"Yes. It is a long and painful story. But know that we made you together. In love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you? Are you here? Are you actually here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am in you. I did not find the link until now. As I told your sister, I will always be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Bliss blinked back her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you notice anything different about yourself?\", Allegra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea what Allegra was talking about, until she stopped to think about it. There was silence. She was alone in her body. The voices were gone. The heaviness, those many souls that had lived in her, they were gone. Most important, the Visitor was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael\u0027s sword killed your blood link to Lucifer. Your father saw you as a way to reach through the boundary that was keeping him in the underworld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m not dead. But my father is dead in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss was overwhelmed with relief. She had her life back. She\u0027d done it!, she had successfully killed herself, just as she and Dylan had known would be her task. She\u0027d done it....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as if she had conjured him from the air, Dylan appeared next to Allegra. \"I\u0027m proud of you, Bliss,\" he said. \"Michael\u0027s sword released the souls that were trapped in your blood. You freed them. You freed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now I\u0027m never going to see you again, am I?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan smiled. \"It\u0027s unlikely. But I never say never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you wouldn\u0027t go. I\u0027ll miss you so much,\" Bliss said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan put his hand up, and so did Bliss. But this time, instead of touching air, she felt his warm hand grasping her cold one. She looked at Allegra. Somehow, she knew her mother was making this happen. Dylan leaned down, and she could feel his lips, soft and inviting, gently kissing hers. Then Dylan was gone. But Bliss did not feel anguished. She felt at peace. Dylan was not broken and incomplete anymore. He was whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are healed.\" Allegra nodded. \"You are no longer a Silver Blood.\" She paused. \"But you are no longer a vampire either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss started. No longer a vampire?, but what did that mean? Did it mean she was just human?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, listen closely.\" Bliss heard Allegra\u0027s voice in her head, in the glom, as if she were speaking directly into Bliss\u0027s mind. \"A long time ago when the world was young and the paths between Heaven and Hell were still open, Lucifer brought the beasts out of the ground, the hounds of Hell. But their alliance with the Silver Bloods was short-lived. The wolves are demon fighters. They stood with the Blue Bloods during the crisis. But over the centuries we have become estranged. You must find them. The Blue Bloods will need them in the final battle with the Silver Bloods. Find the wolves. Tame them. Bring them back into the fold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where do I start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have not left you alone. You will have someone to help you with your task. Someone who loves you and will take care of you since I cannot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss understood. Miss Murray was standing next to Allegra, and she did not look like an apple-cheeked history teacher. Instead, her eyes were gray and serious... and Bliss gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jordan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew me by that name once. Her teacher nodded. But my true name is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sophia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite right. Good girl.\" Miss Murray beamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what I should call you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Miss Murray will do for now. Although, if you like, you can call me Aunt Jane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael\u0027s sword. You were the one who slipped it into my bouquet. I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I?\", Bliss asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer teacher did not deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you would use it the right way. I had faith in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I\u0027m not a vampire anymore... how can I do anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of being human scared her. To live without the incredible abilities given by the undying blood... to be so frail and weak... and absolutely powerless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do your best. That is all I ask of you\", her mother told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" Bliss asked, using her voice now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere no one can follow. But do not despair. We will meet again, Bliss Llewellyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegra, before you leave... can you tell me... what is my name? I mean to say, Mimi is Azrael and Jack is Abbadon. But I don\u0027t know my real name. I never have. Do I even have one?\" Bliss asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Names are forged in Heaven. Your father named you Azazel, the Darkling. But I shall name you Lupus Theliel, Angel of Love, and my Wolfsbane.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-van-alen-legacy-blue-bloods-4/page-35.html","bookId":2122,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:52 PM"}
