{"id":11023,"no":14,"title":"SCENE XIV","content":"Denis O\u0027Hara appropriately lived in Gay Street. As all the world knows, Gay Street runs steeply from the green exclusiveness of Queen Square, to the lofty elegance, the columnal solemnity of the King\u0027s Circus. Being a locality of the most fashionable, Gay Street was apt to be deserted enough at those hours when Fashion, according to the unwritten laws of Bath, foregathered in other quarters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Towards eight o\u0027clock of the evening of the day after his duel with Sir Jasper, Mr. Denis O\u0027Hara, seated at his open window, disconsolate in a very gorgeous dressing-gown and a slight fever fit, found it indeed so damnably deserted that the sight of a sedan-chair and two toiling chairmen coming up the incline became quite an object of interest to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To be sure,\" thought he, \"don\u0027t I know it\u0027s only some old hen being joggled home to roost, after losing sixpence and her temper at piquet? But what\u0027s to prevent me beguiling myself for a bit by dreaming of some lovely young female coming to visit me in me misfortune? Sure it\u0027s the rats those fellows are, that not one of them would keep me company to-night! There\u0027s nobody like your dear friends for smelling out an empty purse. Musha!\" said Mr. O\u0027Hara, putting his head out of the window, \"if the blessed ould chair isn\u0027t stopping at me own door!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A bell pealing through the house confirmed his observation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a woman! By the powers, it\u0027s a woman! Tim, Tim, ye devil!\" roared Mr. O\u0027Hara, \"come to me this minute, or I\u0027ll brain ye.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Conscious of his invalid negligé, he rose in his chair; but, curiosity proving stronger than decorum, was unable to tear himself from his post of vantage at the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! the doaty little foot!\" he cried in rapture, as arched pink-silk instep and a brocade slipper of daintiest proportion emerged, in a little cloud of lace, from the dim recesses of the chair, upon his delighted vision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned for a moment to bellow again into the room:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tim, you limb of Satan, where are you at all? Sure, I\u0027m not fit to be seen by any lady, let alone such a foot as that!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When he popped his head once more through the window, only the chairmen occupied the street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s for the ground floor, of course; for the French marquis,\" said O\u0027Hara, and sat down, feeling as flat as a pancake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next instant a knock at the door sent the quick blood flying to the red head. The \"limb of Satan,\" more generally known as Tim Mahoney, an ingratiating, untidy fellow, with a cunning leer and a coaxing manner, stood ogling his master on the threshold; then he jerked with his thumb several times over his shoulder, and grinned with exquisite enjoyment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it?\" said O\u0027Hara fiercely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tim winked, and jerked his thumb once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Speak, ye ugly divil, or by heavens I\u0027ll spoil your beauty for you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your sisther!\" cried Tim, with a rumbling subterraneous laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me sisther, man?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay, yer honour,\" said the scamp, who, as O\u0027Hara\u0027s foster-brother, was well aware that his master boasted no such gentle tie. \"Sure she\u0027s heard your honour\u0027s wounded, and she\u0027s come to visit you. \u0027I\u0027m Misther O\u0027Hara\u0027s sister,\u0027 says she——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And am I not?\" cried a sweet voice behind him, \"or, if not, at least a very, very dear cousin, and, in any case, I must see Mr. O\u0027Hara at once, and alone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To be sure,\" cried O\u0027Hara, eagerly rising in every way to the situation, and leaping forward. \"Show in the lady, you villain!—Oh, my darling!\" cried the Irishman, opening generous arms, \"but I am glad to see ye!—Tim, you scoundrel, shut the door behind you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The visitor was much enveloped, besides being masked. But there was not a moment\u0027s hesitation in the ardour of Mr. O\u0027Hara\u0027s welcome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sir, sir!\" cried a faint voice from behind the folds of lace, \"what conduct is this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, sisther darling, sure, me heart\u0027s been hungering for you! Another kiss, me dear, dear cousin!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. O\u0027Hara!\" cried Mistress Bellairs, in tones of unmistakable indignation; tore off her mask, and stood with panting bosom and fiery eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tare and ages!\" exclaimed the ingenuous Irishman. \"If it isn\u0027t me lovely Kitty!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mistress Bellairs, if you please, Mr. O\u0027Hara,\" said the lady with great dignity. \"I am glad to see, sir, that that other passion of which I have heard so much has not interfered with the strength of your family affections.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She sat down, and fanned herself with her mask, and, looking haughtily round the room, finally fixed her gaze, with much interest, upon the left branch of the chandelier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a second, Mr. O\u0027Hara\u0027s glib tongue seemed at a loss; but it was only for a second. With a graceful movement he gathered the skirts of his fine-flowered damask dressing-gown more closely over the puce satin small clothes, which, he was sadly conscious, were not in their first freshness, besides bearing the trace of one over-generous bumper of what he was fond of calling the ruby-wine. Then, sinking on one knee, he began to pour a tender tale into the widow\u0027s averted ear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And it\u0027s the fine ninny ye must think me, Kitty darling—I beg your pardon, darling; ma\u0027am it shall be, though I vow to see ye toss your little head like that, and set all those elegant little curls dancing, is enough to make anyone want to start you at it again. Oh, sure, it\u0027s the divine little ear you have, but, be jabers, Kitty, if it\u0027s the back of your neck you want to turn on me—there now, if I was to be shot for it, I couldn\u0027t help it—with the little place there just inviting my lips.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Keep your kisses for your sister, sir, or your cousin!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What in the world—— And d\u0027ye think I didn\u0027t know you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A likely tale!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May I die this minute if I didn\u0027t know you before ever you were out of the ould chair!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pray, sir,\" with an angry titter, \"how will even your fertile wits prove that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure, didn\u0027t I see the little pink foot of you step out, and didn\u0027t I know it before ever it reached the ground?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lord forgive you!\" said Mistress Kitty gravely. But a dimple peeped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had now possessed himself of her hand, which he was caressing with the touch of the tentative lover, tenderer than a woman\u0027s, full of mute cajoling inquiry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope the Lord may forgive me for setting up and worshipping an idol. I believe there\u0027s something against that in the commandments, darling, but sure, maybe, old Moses wouldn\u0027t have been so hard on those Israelites if they\u0027d had the gumption to raise a pretty woman in the midst of them, instead of an old gilt Calf.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this word, Mistress Kitty gave a perceptible start.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, dear,\" said she, \"never, never speak to me of that dreadful animal again! Oh, Denis,\" she said, turning upon him for the first time her full eyes, as melting and as pathetic just then as it was in their composition to look, \"I am in sad, sad trouble, and I don\u0027t know what to do!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here she produced a delicate handkerchief, and applied it to her eyelashes, which she almost believed herself had become quite moist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me jewel!\" cried Mr. O\u0027Hara, preparing to administer the first form of consolation that occurred to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Be quiet,\" said Mistress Kitty testily. \"Get up, sir! I have to consult you. There, there, sit down. Oh, I am in earnest, and this is truly serious.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. O\u0027Hara, though with some reluctance, obeyed. He drew his chair as near to the widow\u0027s as she would permit him, and pursed his lips into gravity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know my Lord Verney,\" began the fascinating widow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do,\" interrupted the irrepressible Irishman, \"and a decent quiet lad he is, though, devil take him, he makes so many bones about losing a few guineas at cards that one would think they grew on his skin!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hush,\" said she. \"I can\u0027t abide him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. O\u0027Hara half started from his armchair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say but the word,\" said he, \"and I\u0027ll run him through the ribs as neat as——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, be quiet,\" cried the lady, in much exasperation. \"How can you talk like that when all the world knows he is to be my husband!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your husband!\" Mr. O\u0027Hara turned an angry crimson to the roots of his crisp red hair. Then he stopped, suffocating.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I don\u0027t want to marry him, you gaby,\" cried Mistress Kitty, with a charming smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her lover turned white, and leaned back against the wing of his great chair. The physician had blooded him that morning by way of mending him for his loss of the previous night, and he felt just a little shaky and swimming. Mistress Kitty\u0027s eye became ever more kindly as it marked those flattering signs of emotion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The noodle,\" said she vindictively, \"mistook the purport of some merely civil words, and forthwith went about bleating to all Bath that he and I were to be wed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll soon stop his mouth for him,\" muttered Mr. O\u0027Hara, moved to less refinement of diction than he usually affected. \"Oh, Kitty,\" said he, and wiped his pale brow, \"sure, it\u0027s the terrible fright you\u0027ve given me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here Mistress Bellairs became suddenly and inexplicably agitated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t understand,\" said she, and stamped her foot. \"Oh, how can I explain? How are people so stupid! I was obliged to go to his rooms this morning—a pure matter of friendship, sir, on behalf of my Lady Standish. Who would have conceived that the calf would take it for himself and think it was for his sake I interfered between him and that madman, Sir Jasper! \u0027Tis very hard,\" cried Mistress Kitty, \"for a lone woman to escape calumny, and now there is my Lord Verney, after braying it to the whole of Bath, this moment writing to his insufferable old mother. And there is that cockatoo aunt of his looking out her most ancient set of garnets and strass for a wedding-gift. And, oh dear, oh dear; what am I to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She turned over the back of her chair, to hide her face in her pocket-handkerchief. In a twinkling, O\u0027Hara was again at her feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Soul of my soul, pulse of my heart!\" cried he. \"Sure, don\u0027t cry, Kitty darling, I\u0027ll clear that little fellow out of your way before you know where you are.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed, sir,\" she said, flashing round upon him with a glance surprisingly bright, considering her woe. \"And is that how you would save my reputation? No, I see there\u0027s nothing for it,\" said Mistress Kitty with sudden composure, folding up her handkerchief deliberately, and gazing up again at the chandelier with the air of an early martyr, \"there\u0027s nothing for it but to pay the penalty of my good-nature and go live at Verney Hall between my virtuous Lord Verney and that paragon of female excellence and domestic piety, his mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, by Saint Peter,\" cried O\u0027Hara, springing to his feet, \"if I have to whip you from under his nose at the very altar, and carry you away myself, I\u0027ll save you from that, me darling!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say you so?\" cried the lady with alacrity. \"Then, indeed, sir,\" she proceeded with sweetest coyness, and pointed her dimple at him, \"I\u0027ll not deny but what I thought you could help me, when I sought you to-night. There was a letter, sir,\" she said, \"which yester morning I received. \u0027Twas signed by a lock of hair——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, Kitty!\" cried the enraptured and adoring Irishman, once more extending wide his arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Softly, sir,\" said she, eluding him. \"Let us to business.\" \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1945/55694.html","bookId":768,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:35:55 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:35:55 AM"}
