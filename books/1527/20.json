Kowalski hit a ridge at full speed and jumped the buggy into the air. The driver hollered his joy. Tucker and Baashi flew into the aluminum half-roof over the bench seat. Tucker managed to get hold of Kane’s leather collar as they crashed back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog growled angrily, ready to bite someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker couldn’t blame him. He glared at the back of Kowalski’s stubbly head, suddenly wishing he were back with the rockets and chain guns. It would be safer than this backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Gray had fled to the other buggy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:48 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this wasn’t so smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray’s buggy twisted sideways down a steep hill, made treacherous by loose shale and slippery scree. He broadsided a patch of brittle bushes at the bottom of the slope and crashed through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan ducked away as thorns and broken branches exploded through the open roll cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce clear, she yelled at him, “Make for the gravel road we saw from the air!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I’m trying to do!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had set off overland initially, thinking the road would be too obvious an escape route if the helicopter decided to give chase. He’d already spotted other cars, trucks, even camels fleeing up that road, driven all in the same direction by the attack. He didn’t want to be trapped in that traffic jam if there was a firefight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis original plan was to travel as far as they could, then cut back to the road. But the hilly terrain proved tougher than it looked, broken up into rocky hummocks, sudden cliffs, and thick patches of bushes and trees. Ahead, it looked even worse as the land pushed up toward the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRisky or not, the road had to be safer than this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, he drove the car up the next rise to get a better view and gain his bearings. In the rearview mirror, he spotted Kowalski following him. And farther behind him, an ominous column of oily black smoke marked the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s hope that’s the helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There!” Seichan pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention forward. A quarter mile away, the road looked little better than a dry riverbed winding across the bitter terrain. It disappeared into the higher hills and scraggly lower forests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski skidded up next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray touched his throat mike as he nosed his vehicle down the far side of the rise. “Kowalski, we’re heading back to the road. We’ll make better time there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad,” his partner responded in his ear. “It was just getting fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the white-knuckled grips of his passengers, Gray doubted they’d describe his driving in such a positive light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the dune runners were made for spinning, jumping, and turning—all necessary skills to traverse this torturous terrain—it still felt like riding a jackhammer on top of a cement mixer. And the last quarter-mile journey back to the road was no gentler on his kidneys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, he fishtailed his buggy onto the gravel, which, after the off-road trek, felt as smooth as a freshly paved highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sped gratefully down the road, which climbed in sweeping switchbacks up into the mountains. Over the next hour, he kept a hard pace, passing the occasional slower truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest slowly grew thicker and taller as they gained elevation. Rounding a sharp turn, he came close to a head-on collision with a camel. The creature dodged around the buggy with a bleating complaint. Gray noted the empty saddle and the bundle of gear tied to it as the beast continued downhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorried, he slowed his buggy to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski flew around the corner with a rumble of his engine and a throaty grind of gears. He came close to rear-ending Gray, but swerved to a halt in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray cut his engines and signaled Kowalski to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence, Gray strained—then heard a distinct pop-pop-pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRifle fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pictured the empty saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ambush,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan immediately understood, too. “Someone set up a roadblock ahead. They’re sweeping up after the helicopter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray nodded. Any refugees who attempted to flee into the mountains were being gunned down ahead. But another cold certainty settled in his belly. It had been nagging him since the first rocket blast. He had hoped the air attack had been orchestrated by local insurgents or warlords. Drugs and medical supplies were as good as gold here, especially in the war-torn south. But this ambush on the road into the mountains removed any uncertainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was about Amanda Gant-Bennett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd worse …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is too bold a move for pirates,” he said. “The chopper attack, now this roadblock. They’re not trying to hide their actions any longer. They’re pulling out the big guns and making a final stand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you getting at?” Seichan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t defense. This is an endgame.” He turned to Seichan. “They wouldn’t move so openly, so brazenly, unless they saw no further need to keep their mountain enclave secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization dawned in Seichan’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Either they’ve moved Amanda already—” she started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray finished, “Or she’s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1:48 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda tugged against the padded leather cuffs tying her to the hospital bed. Minutes ago, they’d placed an IV catheter in her right arm and given her an injection that fogged the edges of her mind. A saline bag slowly dripped next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to panic but couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than the drugs, what kept her calm was the steady beeping of a fetal heart monitor. The nurse had strapped a sensor belt around her belly. It communicated wirelessly to the bedside device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy baby’s fine … my baby’s fine …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her mantra to keep her sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially with all the commotion in the room. Blue-smocked medical personnel came and went, busy behind the privacy screen of the other bed. Elsewhere, soldiers hauled out equipment under the direction of Dr. Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement to the side drew her muddled attention to Petra. The nurse hauled a portable anesthetic machine to her bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sight of the clear mask hanging from the hoses, Amanda fought against her cuffs, but she was already too weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Blake came over and touched her wrist. He raised a syringe filled with a milky fluid. “Don’t worry. We won’t let any harm come to your baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was unable to stop him as he inserted the syringe needle into her IV line and slowly pushed the plunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra lowered a mask toward her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted her head away. Across the room, she watched one of the medical staff push aside the privacy screen. At long last, she saw who shared the ward with her, who lay in the other bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror swelled through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed as Petra grabbed her head and forced the mask down over her nose and mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, now, it’ll be all over in a few seconds,” Blake promised her. “Three, two …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness closed around her, narrowing her view of the world to a pinpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 2, 1:55 P.M. East Africa Time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal Madow mountains, Somalia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray paced the shoulder of the road while the sun baked the gravel into a shimmering mirage. He and the others kept to the shadows of the neighboring forest. It sang with the buzz of cicadas and the calls of songbirds. Farther up into the highlands, green forests beckoned, draped in mists, like a sliver of Eden. Emphasizing this, the occasional breeze carried down the scent of wild-growing jasmine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutched a satellite phone in his hand and weighed the risks of opening an encrypted communication channel to Sigma command. From the series of attacks—both in Boosaaso and here—intelligence was clearly leaking to the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now, his team had a thin advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one knows we’re still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray wanted to keep it that way. But more than that, what would be gained in the end if he reached out to Sigma? What support could they offer? To mobilize an adequate response would risk exposing both their survival and their location. Even SEAL Team Six, awaiting word in neighboring Djibouti, could not be activated. Such an overt force had a limited window to get in and get out safely. It was up to Gray’s team to first pin down the whereabouts of the president’s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Gray attempted to call the States and if word should reach her captors that his team was closing in on her position, the enemy would be more apt to act rashly, to kill her on the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing what he had to do, Gray shoved the satellite phone back into his pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re on our own until we find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that settled, he waved Seichan over to him. She approached with Baashi, a hand resting on his shoulder. Gray noticed how protective she was with the boy. He had never seen her bond so quickly to another person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray knelt in front of Baashi. “Can you show us on the map where the other hospital camp is hidden? The one with the bad doctor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy looked down at his toes and shook his head. “I no can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaashi looked scared. Gray imagined the gunfire must have spooked him, likely triggering memories of other firefights he had been in as a child soldier. Kane could probably help soothe those rattled nerves, but Tucker knelt with his dog at the edge of the forest, suiting his partner up in a Kevlar vest. The pair readied themselves for a reconnaissance mission, to get some eyes on the ambush ahead and ascertain what sort of force lay between them and the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther away, Kowalski and the SRR woman, Major Jain, had returned to the last switchback, blocked the road with their two buggies, and turned away any vehicles trying to use the road to get into the mountains. Jain knew the native dialects well enough to persuade them to take a different route, though Gray suspected Jain’s pistol and Kowalski’s rifle did most of the persuading for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had to admit the British major was an asset and, considering how she handled Kowalski, matching him toe-to-toe, she was one tough soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would need that ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray returned his attention forward. The best chance for Gray’s small team was to slip past that enemy line unseen. They didn’t have the manpower for a full frontal assault. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-20.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
