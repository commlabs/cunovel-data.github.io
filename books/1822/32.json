He gazed at me for a moment, then collected himself again, cleared his throat and went on: ‘Err… very well. Miss Linton, may I be allowed to introduce my friend Lieutenant Ellingham to your notice?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, you may.’ The smile on my face was widened a bit and I nodded graciously. ‘Delighted to make your acquaintance, Lieutenant Ellingham,’ I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As am I,’ said the young man, whose arrogant smile had not in the least been reduced in radiance by my rebuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, I’ll leave you to it then,’ the Major said, throwing me another odd glance and then disappearing with an eye roll at his friend. I saw the message ‘It’s your funeral’ clearly in those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was right. It was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Ellingham seated himself beside me. Taking the bull by the horns, I turned to him. Best to get this over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, what should we talk about, Lieutenant? The weather would be a good subject of discussion, if we were not inside and it was night.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How about the society?’ he asked, gesturing towards the people dancing everywhere in the grand room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That would be unwise. When you make conversation, it is generally considered best to say nice and polite things. And the present society would not furnish me with a lot of opportunities for that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked at me, no doubt wondering if he had heard right. In the end, he seemed to decide that he had not. I was a lady, after all. Ladies didn’t say impolite things. It was unheard of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of trying to find another topic, he cut right to the chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I must admit, Miss Linton, that I had a particular reason for wishing an introduction with you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did you, now?’ I couldn’t entirely keep the sarcasm out of my voice. But the young man’s arrogance apparently made him immune to sarcasm from ladies as well as to impudence. He gave me a smile that he probably thought was charming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, I did. I have been admiring you from afar for some time now. You have caught my eye, Miss Linton.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed?’ I raised an eyebrow. ‘I can’t remember you throwing it at me, to be honest. I don\u0027t have your eye on me, I promise. I never catch eyes. They are rather slippery and slimy things, not at all the kind of objects I would like to carry around in my pocket.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Um…’ he blinked, just as dumbfounded as his friend before, clearly lacking the brains to decipher my reply. For some unknown reason, I took pity on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Were you going to ask me if I would dance with you?’ I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes! That is it, exactly. How did you know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Let’s just say I am a discerning person. Well, if it is a dance you want, that makes things very simple.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excellent.’ He got up, his arrogant grin back on his face, and held a hand out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ I said, not looking up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye, I saw a look of confusion cross his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excuse me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You want to dance with me - I have just given you my answer. No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. Why don\u0027t you try that young lady over there? She looks to be in want of a partner, and unlike me, she actually wants one. Goodbye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood rooted to the spot for a few more seconds, then let his hand drop and walked off. Picking another piece of chocolate off the plate, I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. For some reason, he didn’t appear very disheartened. If I had to choose a word to describe his facial expression, I think I would have chosen ‘intrigued,’ though I didn’t see how the bloody hell that could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the potted plants, I saw him return to his friends, and they hooted and slapped him on the back while he grinned shame-faced. I was very pleased with myself. Now, finally, there would be an end of the matter. No more invitations to dance tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later a cough distracted me, and I looked up only to be confronted with another officer asking me to dance. I turned him down like a bedspread. And the one after that. And the one after the one after that. And the other gentlemen who followed, from captains to colonels, from misters to majors. It was amazing - the more of them I sent packing, the more seemed to pop up everywhere. You’d think that by now they would have gotten the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a break in the assault of dance-addicted gentlemen, I took another peep through the foliage. Ella was again being whisked across the floor in the arms of Sir Philip Wilkins and looked about ready to faint from the attention. I grinned. It would do her good to be out in society. Maybe she would get a little more confidence and experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I let my eyes wander farther over the assembled guests, I noticed something strange: I couldn’t see my aunt anywhere. That was very curious indeed. Ella, Maria and Anne were busy hunting for prospective husbands. Lisbeth was doing her best, and even Gertrude was dancing with a quiet, elderly gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aunt would hardly leave the dance floor at such a moment, unless it would be to…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the voice of doom spoke behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lilly - What in the name of the Lord is this I have been hearing, about you refusing to dance?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh blast!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aunt emerged from behind a potted plant like a vulture from behind a lone desert rock and stalked towards me. I could almost see the sword of just punishment in her right and the scales in her left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Err… hello, Aunt,’ I said. ‘This is a nice evening. Wonderful ball, don\u0027t you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut apparently, my aunt did not want to change the subject right now. ‘I heard from Colonel Remington that you refused to dance with him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Um… only from him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, he… Wait, what do you mean, only from him? Do you mean to say there are others with whom you refused to dance?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have slapped myself for not keeping my big mouth shut. I wasn’t usually timid, but in the face of the huge fire breathing dragon that was my aunt, I cowered on my chair, my eyes downcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Err… maybe?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Either you did or you didn’t. Well?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How many? Two? Three?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Err… more something like… thirteen? Maybe fourteen?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching my aunt’s expression, I truly believe that had we been at home, my eardrums would have been in some danger of being shattered by her reaction. However, at this very moment a gentleman stepped up to the refreshment tables and took a piece of chocolate off the plates, reminding my aunt that we were in company and that ladies did not scream like furies when they were in company. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-32.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:33 PM"}
