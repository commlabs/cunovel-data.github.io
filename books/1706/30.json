Lightweight. About two feet long. They\u0027re outdated versions of an \u002780s Warsaw Pact device called Hotfire. Handheld, wire-guided, solid propellant, range of about a thousand yards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah wasn\u0027t sure what all that meant. \"So, these are weapons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that\u0027s why they bought them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many did they buy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five hundred. With launchers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say they\u0027re probably not hobbyists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the doors, a banner in flaking yellow and green paint read, Camping Gear Paintball Paratrooper Jackets Compass Sleeping Bags Much, Much More!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door chimed as they went in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe store was large and disorderly, filled with military stuff on racks and piled in untidy heaps on the floor. The air smelled musty, like old canvas. There were few people inside at this hour. Kenner walked directly to the kid at the cash register, flashed his wallet, and asked for Mr. Brader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid smiled at Sarah. Kenner went to the back of the store. Sarah stayed at the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" she said. \"I need a little help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do my best.\" He grinned. He was a crew-cut kid, maybe nineteen or twenty. He had a black T-shirt that said \"The Crow.\" His arms looked like he worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to find a guy,\" Sarah said, and slid a sheet of paper toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think any guy would be trying to find you,\" the kid said. He picked up the paper. It showed a photograph of the man they knew as Brewster, who had set up camp in Antarctica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah,\" the kid said immediately. \"Sure, I know him. He comes in sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but he\u0027s in the store now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" She glanced around for Kenner, but he was in the back, huddled with the owner. She didn\u0027t want to call to him or do anything to cause attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid was standing on tiptoes, looking around. \"Yeah, he\u0027s here. I mean, he was in here a few minutes ago. Came in to buy some timers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are your timers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you.\" He came around the counter, and led her through the stacks of green clothing and the boxes piled seven feet high. She couldn\u0027t see over them. She could no longer see Kenner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid glanced over his shoulder at her. \"What are you, like a detective?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to go out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were moving deeper into the store when they heard the chime of the front door. She turned to look. Over stacks of flak jackets, she had a glimpse of a brown head, a white shirt with a red collar, and the door closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s leaving amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t think. She just turned and sprinted for the door. The bag banged against her hip. She jumped over stacked canteens, running hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" the kid yelled behind her. \"You coming back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe banged through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was out on the street. Glaring hot sun and shoving crowds. She looked left and right. She didn\u0027t see the white shirt and red collar anywhere. There hadn\u0027t been time for him to cross the street. She looked around the corner, and saw him strolling casually away from her, toward Fifth Street. She followed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a man of about thirty-five, dressed in cheap golf-type clothes. His pants were rumpled. He wore dirty hiking boots. He had tinted glasses and a small, trim moustache. He looked like a guy who spent a lot of time outdoors, but not a construction guymore of a supervisor. Maybe a building contractor. Building inspector. Something like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to notice the details, to remember them. She gained on him, then decided that was a bad idea, and dropped back. \"Brewster\" stopped in front of one window and looked at it intently for a few moments, then went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to the window. It was a crockery store, displaying cheap plates. She wondered, then, if he already knew he was being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo trail a terrorist on a downtown street felt like something out of a movie, but it was more frightening than she anticipated. The surplus store seemed very far behind her. She didn\u0027t know where Kenner was. She wished he were here. Also, she was hardly inconspicuous; the crowd on the sidewalk was largely Hispanic, and Sarah\u0027s blond head stuck up above most people\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped off the curb, and walked along the street gutter, hanging at the edge of the crowd. That way she lost six inches of height. But still, she was uncomfortably aware that her hair was distinctively blonde. But there was nothing she could do about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let Brewster get twenty yards ahead of her. She didn\u0027t want to allow more distance than that because she was afraid she\u0027d lose him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrewster crossed Fifth Street, and continued on. He went another half a block, and then turned left, down an alley. Sarah got to the alley entrance, and paused. There were garbage bags stacked at intervals. She could smell the rotten odor from where she was. A big delivery truck blocked the far end of the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no Brewster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t possible, unless he had walked through one of the back doors that opened onto the alley. There were doors every twenty feet or so, many of them recessed into the brick wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip. She didn\u0027t like the idea that she couldn\u0027t see him. But there were delivery men down at the truck amp;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started down the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at each door as she passed it. Some were boarded shut, some were locked. A few had grimy signs giving the name of the firm, and saying USE FRONT ENTRANCE OR PRESS BELL FOR SERVICE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Brewster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had gotten halfway down the alley when something made her look back. She was just in time to see Brewster step out of a doorway and head back to the street, moving quickly away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she passed the doorway, she saw an elderly woman standing in the door. The sign on the door said, Munro Silk and Fabrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is he?\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman shrugged, shaking her head. \"Wrong door. They all do\" She said something more, but by then Sarah couldn\u0027t hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was back on the sidewalk, still running. Heading toward Fourth. She could see Brewster half a block ahead. He was walking quickly, almost a jog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed Fourth. A pickup truck pulled over to the side, a few yards ahead. It was battered blue, with Arizona license plates. Brewster jumped in the passenger side, and the truck roared off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was scribbling down the license plate when Kenner\u0027s car screeched to a stop alongside her. \"Get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did, and he accelerated forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting the car. I saw you leave. Did you film him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had forgotten all about the bag on her shoulder. \"Yes, I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I got a name for this guy, from the store owner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s probably an alias. David Poulson. And a shipping address.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the rockets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, for the launch stands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner said, \"Flagstaff, Arizona.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, they saw the blue pickup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed the pickup down Second, past the Los Angeles Times building, past the criminal courts, and then onto the freeway. Kenner was skilled; he managed to stay well back, but always kept the truck in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done this before,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that little card you show everybody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner pulled out his wallet, and handed it to her. There was a silver badge, looking roughly like a police badge, except it said \"NSIA\" on it. And there was an official license for \"National Security Intelligence Agency,\" with his photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of the National Security Intelligence Agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner nodded, took the wallet back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stays below the radar,\" Kenner said. \"Have you heard from Evans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to tell,\" Kenner said. \"Domestic terrorism makes domestic agencies uncomfortable. They\u0027re either too harsh or too lenient. Everyone in NSIA is specially trained. Now, call Sanjong and read him the license plate on that pickup, see if he can trace it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you do domestic terrorism?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, the pickup truck moved onto the Interstate 5 freeway, heading east, past the clustered yellowing buildings of County General Hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they going?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"But this is the road to Arizona.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the phone and called Sanjong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanjong wrote down the license, and called back in less than five minutes. \"It\u0027s registered to the Lazy-Bar Ranch, outside Sedona,\" he told Kenner. \"It\u0027s apparently a guest ranch and spa. The truck hasn\u0027t been reported stolen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Who owns the ranch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a holding company: Great Western Environmental Associates. They own a string of guest ranches in Arizona and New Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who owns the holding company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m checking on that, but it\u0027ll take some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanjong hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, the pickup truck moved into the right lane, and turned on its blinker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pulling off the road,\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed the truck through an area of seedy industrial parks. Sometimes the signs said sheet works or machine tooling, but most of the buildings were blocky and unrevealing. The air was hazy, almost a light fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two miles, the truck turned right again, just past a sign that said ltsi corp. And beneath that, a small picture of an airport, with an arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be a private airfield,\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s LTSI?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther down the road, they could see the little airfield, with several small prop planes, Cessnas and Pipers, parked to one side. The truck drove up and parked alongside a twin-engine plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twin Otter,\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that significant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short takeoff, large payload. It\u0027s a workhorse aircraft. Used for fire-fighting, all sorts of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrewster got out of the truck, and walked to the cockpit of the plane. He spoke briefly to the pilot. Then he got back in the truck, and drove a hundred yards down the road, pulling up in front of a huge rectangular shed of corrugated steel. There were two other trucks parked alongside it. The sign on the shed said ltsi, in big blue letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrewster got out of the truck, and came around the back as the driver of the truck got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son of a bitch,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver was the man they knew as Bolden. He was now wearing jeans, a baseball cap, and sunglasses, but there was no doubt about his identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy,\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched as Brewster and Bolden walked into the shed through a narrow door. The door closed behind them with a metallic clang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner turned to Sarah. \"You stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of the car, walked quickly to the shed, and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in the passenger seat, shading her eyes against the sun, and waited. The minutes dragged. She squinted at the sign on the side of the shed, because she could detect small white lettering beneath the large ltsi initials. But she was too far away to make out what it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of calling Sanjong, but didn\u0027t. She worried about what would happen if Brewster and Bolden came out, but Kenner remained inside. She would have to follow them alone. She couldn\u0027t let them get away amp;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat thought led her to slide over into the driver\u0027s seat. She rested her hands on the wheel. She looked at her watch. Surely nine or ten minutes had already passed. She scanned the shed for any sign of activity, but the building was clearly made to be as unobtrusive and as unrevealing as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her watch again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to feel like a coward, just sitting there. All her life, she had confronted the things that frightened her. That was why she had learned to ski black diamond ice, to rock climb (even though she was too tall), to scuba dive wrecks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, she was just sitting in a hot car, waiting as the minutes ticked by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell with it, she thought. And she got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the door to the shed, there were two small signs. One said ltsi lightning test systems international. The second said warning: do not enter test bed during discharge intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah opened the door cautiously. There was a reception area, but it was deserted. On a plain wooden desk was a handwritten sign and a buzzer. PRESS BUZZER FOR ASSISTANCE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored the buzzer, and opened the inner door, which was ominously marked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO TRESPASSING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHIGH VOLTAGE DISCHARGE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went through the door and came into an open, dimly lit industrial spacepipes on the ceiling, a catwalk, rubber-tile floor underfoot. It was all quite dark except for a two-story glass-walled chamber in the center, which was brightly lit. It was a fairly large space, roughly the size of her living room. Inside the chamber she saw what looked like an airplane jet engine, mounted on a small section of wing. At the side of the room was a large metal plate, set against the wall. And outside the room was a control panel. A man was sitting in front of the panel. Brewster and Bolden were nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the room, a recessed monitor screen flashed clear area now. A computer voice said, \"Please clear the test area. Testing begins in amp;thirty seconds.\" Sarah heard a slowly building whine, and the chugging of a pump. But nothing was happening that she could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, she moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ssst!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around, but could not see where the sound was coming from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ssst!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up. Kenner was above her, on the catwalk. He gestured for her to join him, pointing to a set of stairs at the corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe computer voice said, \"Testing begins in amp;twenty seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed the stairs and crouched beside Kenner. The whine had now built to a shriek, and the chugging was rapid, almost a continuous sound. Kenner pointed to the jet engine, and whispered, \"They\u0027re testing airplane parts.\" He explained quickly that airplanes were frequently struck by lightning, and all their components had to be lightning proof. He said something else, too, but she couldn\u0027t really hear him over the increasing noise. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-30.html","bookId":1706,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM"}
