It\u0026nbsp; may be taken for grantedthat\u0026nbsp; our relations\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; Anacreon will\u0026nbsp; be smoothed\u0026nbsp; out to\u0026nbsp; our completesatisfaction\u0026nbsp; as\u0026nbsp; soon as\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; Emperor\u0026nbsp; is informed\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; the situation.\u0026nbsp; \"He smiled and addressed Hardin across the length of the table. \"Informationto this effect has been given the Journal.\"Hardin snickered below his\u0026nbsp; breath. It seemed evident that Pirenne\u0027s desireto strut this information\u0026nbsp; before him had been one reason for his admissioninto the sacrosanctum.\n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0026nbsp; said evenly:\u0026nbsp; \"Leaving vague\u0026nbsp; expressions out\u0026nbsp; of account, what\u0026nbsp; do youexpect Lord Dorwin to do?\"Tomaz\u0026nbsp; Sutt replied.\u0026nbsp; He had\u0026nbsp; a bad\u0026nbsp; habit of\u0026nbsp; addressing one in\u0026nbsp; the thirdperson when in his more stately moods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is\u0026nbsp; quite evident,\" he\u0026nbsp; observed, \"that Mayor Hardin\u0026nbsp; is a professionalcynic.\u0026nbsp; He can\u0026nbsp; scarcely fail\u0026nbsp; to realize\u0026nbsp; that the\u0026nbsp; Emperor would\u0026nbsp; be mostunlikely to allow his personal rights to be infringed.\"\"Why?
