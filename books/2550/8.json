He was your own dad, and that’s all you know about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told him, “Shut your mouth, before I smack it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he was fair. Don’t you get it? The boys and girls on the street who sell the septic sacks and run ’em, and the thieves, the whores, and the broke and the busted—all of ’em down here who know the hard way how life ain’t fair… they all believe in Maynard because he was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar interrogated Rector on the finer points of Zeke’s escape. By the time a larger priest and a greater number of nuns showed up to bully Briar out of the stairwell, she’d learned plenty—none of it reassuring, and all of it leading to one terrifying fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer son had gone inside the walled-up city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEzekiel Wilkes shivered at the entrance to the old water runoff system. He stared into the hole as if it might eat him, or as if he wanted it to—because he was having second thoughts about this whole thing. But his third thoughts were insistent. He’d come this far. He only had a few yards to go, through a large tunnel and into a city that had been functionally dead since before he was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lantern in his hand quivered with the chilled shakes of his elbow. In his pocket, a folded, wrinkled map was wadded into a nub. He only carried it as a matter of formality. He knew it by heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was one thing he didn’t know, and it bothered him greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know where his parents had once lived. Not exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother had never mentioned an address, but he was sure they’d lived up on Denny Hill, which gave him a place to start looking. The hill itself wasn’t so big, and he knew roughly what the house looked like. At bedtime when he was younger, Zeke’s mother had described it to him as if it’d been a castle. If it still stood, it was lavender and cream, with two full stories and a turret. It had a porch that wrapped around the front of the house; and on that porch was a rocking chair painted to look like it was made of wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was actually made of metal, and fitted with a mechanism that connected to the floor. When a crank was wound, the chair would rock itself for the benefit of anyone who was sitting in it at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeke found it almost infuriating how little he knew about the man who’d made it work. But he thought he knew where to look for answers. All he had to do was hike through the tunnel and head up the hill to his immediate left, which ought to be Denny Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wished he had somebody to ask, but there wasn’t anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t anything, except a wafting stink from the heavy fumes of a mysterious gas that still leaked out from the earth inside the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow was as good a time as any to put on his mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath before sliding the harness over his face and securing it. When he exhaled, the interior fogged for a second and then cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel looked even more distant and unearthly when he viewed it through the mask’s visor. It appeared elongated and strange, and the darkness seemed to wobble and twist when he turned his head. The straps of the mask rubbed itchily where they lay over and under his ears. He slipped a finger up underneath the leather and ran it back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked his lantern for the dozenth time and yes, it was full of oil. He checked his bag and yes, it had all the supplies he’d been able to swipe. He was as ready as he was ever going to be, which was only just ready enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeke turned up the lantern’s wick to give himself as much light as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the threshold, forcing himself past the line between mere night and someplace darker. His lantern filled the interior of the brick-lined, man-made cave with a wash of gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d meant to leave earlier, in the morning after his mother had gone to the Waterworks. But it’d taken all day to get his supplies together, and Rector had been difficult about the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now it was almost dark outside, and perfectly dark inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lantern cast a bubbled halo that carried him forward, into the unknown. He navigated the crumbled spots where the ceiling had dropped itself in pieces and piles; and he dodged the hanging tendrils of moss that was thicker than seaweed; and he ducked beneath the spiderwebs that dangled, waving, from brick to brick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere and there he saw signs of prior passage, but he didn’t know if he felt reassured that he was not the first to come this way. On the walls he saw black scuff marks where matches had been struck or cigarettes stubbed out; and he spied tiny, shapeless wads of wax that were too small to work as candles any longer. The initials W.L. were rubbed onto one cluster of bricks. Shards of broken glass glittered between weather-widened cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he could hear was the rhythmic tap of his footsteps, his muffled breaths, and the rusty hinge of the swinging lantern as it bounced back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was another sound, one that made him think he was being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung the lantern around, but saw no one. And there was no place for anyone to hide—it was a straight shot from the bricks where he stood to the beach. Forward, the way was less clear. As far as he could see, at the very edges of the lantern’s reach, nothing but more emptiness waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grade rose. He was going up, very slightly. The open places above him where the bricks had come away did not show any sky because they were covered by earth. The echoes of the small sounds in the tunnel became more smothered and close. Zeke had expected it, but it made him more uncomfortable than he would’ve thought. He knew that the geography jerked up away from the coast, and that the exposed tunnel wormed a path underneath the city proper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Rector was right, at the end of the main pathway the route would split four ways. The leftmost one would lead up to the basement of a bakery. The roof of that building would be a semisafe place to get a handle on his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderground and in the dark, the way seemed to curve left, and then right. Zeke didn’t think he’d made a full circle, but he was definitely disoriented. He hoped that he’d still be able to pin down Denny Hill when he broke the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter what felt like miles—but was surely only a fraction of that—the way widened and fractured as Rector had promised. Zeke took the hole on the far left and followed it another hundred feet before it terminated in a total dead end—or so he thought, until he backtracked slightly and found the secondary passage. This new corridor did not appear crafted, but dug. It did not look reinforced or secure. It looked temporary, spontaneous, and ready to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls were more mud than stone or brick, and they were filthy wet. So was the floor, which was mostly a mash of decomposing sawdust, soil, and plant roots. It bit down on his boots and tried to hold him, but he slogged forward and finally, at the end of another twist and on the other side of another turn, he found a ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a skip and a jump he extricated himself from the gummy muck and seized the ladder hard. He lifted himself out and up, and into a basement so thickly dusted that even the mice and roaches left tracks on every surface. And there were footprints, too—quite a number of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a rough glance he counted maybe ten sets of feet that had passed this way. He told himself that it was good, that he was glad to see that other people had survived the trip without trouble, but in truth it made him queasy. He’d hoped, and partly plotted, to find an empty city filled with mindless perils. Everybody knew about the rotters. Rector had told Zeke about the quiet societies that kept underground and out of sight, but mostly Zeke hoped to avoid them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, footprints… well…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootprints implied he might run into other people at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he surveyed the room and determined that it held nothing of value, he resolved to be on his most careful behavior. While he climbed the stairs in the corner, he vowed to stick to the shadows and keep his head down, and his gun ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, he liked the thought of it. He enjoyed the prospect of being one boy against the universe, on a grand and dangerous adventure—even if it was only going to last a few hours. He would move like a thief in the night. He would be as invisible as a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the first floor, all the windows were boarded and covered, reinforced and braced from corner to corner. A counter with a splintered glass cover rotted along the wall, and a set of old striped awnings lay forgotten in a pile. Stacks of rusting pans cluttered a broken-down sink, and a dilapidated cash box was scattered in pieces across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found a ladder propped in an empty pantry. At the top of the ladder a trapdoor had been left unlocked. He pushed against it with his hand, his head, and his shoulder, and it opened away from him. In a moment, he was on the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was something cold and hard pressed against the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze, one foot still on the ladder’s top step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeke replied, without turning around, “Hello yourself.” He tried to keep it low and growly, but he was scared and it came out at a higher pitch than he’d hoped for. In front of him he saw nothing but the corners of an empty rooftop; as far as the visor and his own peripheral vision could tell him, he was alone except for whomever was behind him with the very cold-barreled gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the lantern down with all the precision and caution he could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing up here, boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Same as you, I reckon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what exactly do you think I’m doing?” his interrogator asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing you’d like to get caught at. Look, let me alone, will you? I don’t got any money or anything.” Zeke slowly stepped out of the hole, balancing carefully, with his hands held uselessly aloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold, circular chill of something hard and dangerous didn’t leave the exposed patch at the base of his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No money, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a penny. Can I turn around? I feel stupid standing here like this. You can shoot me just as easy if I’m facing you. I’m not armed or nothing. Come on, let me loose. I didn’t do nothing to you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boneshaker-the-clockwork-century-1/page-8.html","bookId":2550,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:52 AM"}
