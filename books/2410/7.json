Three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just two.\" He smiled. \"Sometimes it seems like three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your wife is an attorney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He felt safer now. The talk of his wife and children made him feel safer somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how somebody can be married,\" Meredith said. \"I tried it.\" She held up her hand. \"Four more alimony payments to the son of a bitch and I\u0027m free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did you marry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some account executive at CoStar. He was cute. Amusing. But it turned out he was a typical gold digger. I\u0027ve been paying him off for three years. And he was a lousy lay.\" She waved her hand, dismissing the subject. She looked at her watch. \"Now come and sit down, and tell me how bad it is with the Twinkle drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want the file? I put it in your briefcase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She patted the couch beside her. \"You just tell me yourself.\" He sat down beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look good, Tom.\" She leaned back and kicked off her heels, wiggled her bare toes. \"God, what a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lot of pressure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sipped her wine and blew a strand of hair from her face. \"A lot to keep track of. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re working together, Tom. I feel as though you\u0027re the one friend I can count on in all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So: how bad is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. It\u0027s hard to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt he had no choice but to lay it all out for her. \"We\u0027ve built very successful prototypes, but the drives coming off the line in KL are running nowhere near a hundred milliseconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith sighed, and shook her head. \"Do we know why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. We\u0027re working on some ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That line\u0027s a start-up, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Then we have problems on a new line. That\u0027s not so bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the thing is,\" he said, \"Conley-White is buying this company for our technology, and especially for the CD-ROM drive. As of today, we may not be able to deliver as promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to tell them that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m concerned they\u0027ll pick it up in due diligence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, maybe not.\" She leaned back in the couch. \"We have to remember what we\u0027re really looking at. Tom, we\u0027ve all seen production problems loom large, only to vanish overnight. This may be one of those situations. We\u0027re shaking out the Twinkle line. We\u0027ve identified some early problems. No big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But we don\u0027t know that. In reality, there may be a problem with controller chips, which means changing our supplier in Singapore. Or there may be a more fundamental problem. A design problem, originating here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Meredith said, \"but as you say, we don\u0027t know that. And I don\u0027t see any reason for us to speculate. At this critical time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But to be honest-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a matter of honesty,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a matter of the underlying reality. Let\u0027s go over it, point by point. We\u0027ve told them we have a Twinkle drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve built a prototype and tested the hell out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the prototype works like gangbusters. It\u0027s twice as fast as the most advanced drives coming out of Japan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve told them we\u0027re in production on the drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" Meredith said, \"we\u0027ve told them all that anybody knows for sure, at this point. I\u0027d say we are acting in good faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe, but I don\u0027t know if we can-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom.\" Meredith placed her hand on his arm. \"I always liked your directness. I want you to know how much I appreciate your expertise and your frank approach to problems. All the more reason why I\u0027m sure the Twinkle drive will get ironed out. We know that fundamentally it\u0027s a good product that performs as we say it does. Personally, I have complete confidence in it, and in your ability to make it work as planned. And I have no problem saying that at the meeting tomorrow.\" She paused, and looked intently at him. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was very close to him, her lips half-parted. \"Do I what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a problem saying that at the meeting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were light blue, almost gray. He had forgotten that, as he had forgotten how long her lashes were. Her hair fell softly around her face. Her lips were full. She had a dreamy look in her eyes. \"No,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t have a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Then at least that settled.\" She smiled and held out her glass. \"Do the honors again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up from the couch and went over to the wine. She watched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you haven\u0027t let yourself go, Tom. You work out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twice a week. How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always had a nice rush. Nice hard rush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned. \"Meredith . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled. \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t help it. We\u0027re old friends.\" She looked concerned. \"I didn\u0027t offend you, did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine you ever getting prudish, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you.\" She laughed. \"Remember the night we broke the bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poured the wine. \"We didn\u0027t exactly break it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure we did. You had me bent over the bottom of the footboard and\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And first we broke the footboard, and then the bottom of the bed crashed downbut you didn\u0027t want to stop so we moved up and then when I was grabbing the headboard it all came\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember,\" he said, wanting to interrupt her, to stop this. \"Those days were great. Listen, Meredith-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then the woman from downstairs called up? Remember her? The old Lithuanian lady? She vanted to know if somebody had died or vhat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Listen. Going back to the drive . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the wineglass. \"I am making you uncomfortable. What did you think I was coming on to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Nothing like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, because I really wasn\u0027t. I promise.\" She gave him an amused glance, then tilted her head back, exposing her long neck, and sipped the wine. \"In fact, I-ah! Ah!\" She winced suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he said, leaning forward, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My neck, it goes into spasm, it\u0027s right there . . .\" With her eyes still squeezed shut in pain, she pointed to her shoulder, near the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just rub it, squeeze-there-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put down his wineglass and rubbed her shoulder. \"There?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ah, harder-squeeze -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the muscles of her shoulder relax, and she sighed. Meredith turned her head back and forth slowly, then opened her eyes. \"Oh . . . Much better . . . Don\u0027t stop rubbing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued rubbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thanks. That feels good. I get this nerve thing. Pinched something, but when it hits, it\u0027s really . . .\" She turned her head back and forth. Testing. \"You did that very well. But you were always good with your hands, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept rubbing. He wanted to stop. He felt everything was wrong, that he was sitting too close, that he didn\u0027t want to be touching her. But it also felt good to touch her. He was curious about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good hands,\" she said. \"God, when I was married, I thought about you all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said. \"I told you, he was terrible in bed. I hate a man who doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing.\" She closed her eyes. \"That was never your problem, was it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, relaxing more, and then she seemed to lean into him, melting toward his body, toward his hands. It was an unmistakable sensation. Immediately, he gave her shoulder a final friendly squeeze, and took his hands away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes. She smiled knowingly. \"Listen,\" she said, \"don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and sipped his wine. \"I\u0027m not worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, about the drive. If it turns out we really have problems and need agreement from higher management, we\u0027ll get it. But let\u0027s not jump the gun now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine. I think that makes sense.\" He felt secretly relieved to be talking once again about the drive. Back on safe ground. \"Who would you take it to? Directly to Garvin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. I prefer to deal informally.\" She looked at him. \"You\u0027ve changed, haven\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No . . . I\u0027m still the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve changed.\" She smiled. \"You never would have stopped rubbing me before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith,\" he said, \"it\u0027s different. You run the division now. I work for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t be silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re colleagues.\" She pouted. \"Nobody around here really believes I\u0027m superior to you. They just gave me the administrative work, that\u0027s all. We\u0027re colleagues, Tom. And I just want us to have an open, friendly relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027m glad we agree on that.\" Quickly, she leaned forward and kissed him lightly on the lips. \"There. Was that so terrible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"lt wasn\u0027t terrible at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? Maybe we\u0027ll have to go to Malaysia together, to check on the assembly lines. They have very nice beaches in Malaysia. You ever been to Kuantan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show it to you. We could take an extra day or two. Stop over. Get some sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody needs to know, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re also a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Tom,\" she said, with mock severity, \"don\u0027t ask me to believe you never have a little adventure on the side. I know you, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew me a long time ago, Meredith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People don\u0027t change. Not that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on. We\u0027re going to be working together, we might as well enjoy ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like the way any of this was going. He felt pushed into an awkward position. He felt stuffy and puritanical when he said: \"I\u0027m married now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t care about your personal life,\" she said lightly. \"I\u0027m only responsible for your on-the-job performance. All work and no play, Tom. It can be bad for you. Got to stay playful.\" She leaned forward. \"Come on. Just one little kiss . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intercom buzzed. \"Meredith,\" the assistant\u0027s voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up in annoyance. \"I told you, no calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s Mr. Garvin, Meredith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" She got off the couch and walked across the room to her desk, saying loudly, \"But after this, Betsy, no more calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Meredith. I wanted to ask you, is it okay if I leave in about ten minutes? I have to see the landlord about my new apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Did you get me that package?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have it right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring it in, and then you can leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Meredith. Mr. Garvin is on two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith picked up the phone and poured more wine. \"Bob,\" she said. \"Hi. What\u0027s up?\" It was impossible to miss the easy familiarity in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke to Garvin, her back turned to Sanders. He sat on the couch, feeling stranded, foolishly passive and idle. The assistant entered the room carrying a small package in a brown paper bag. She gave the package to Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Bob,\" Meredith was saying. \"I couldn\u0027t agree more. We\u0027ll certainly deal with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assistant, waiting for Meredith to dismiss her, smiled at Sanders. He felt uncomfortable just sitting there on the couch, so he got up, walked to the window, pulled his cellular phone out of his pocket, and dialed Mark Lewyn\u0027s number. He had promised to call Lewyn anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith was saying, \"That\u0027s a very good thought, Bob. I think we should act on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders heard his call dial, and then an answering machine picked up. A male voice said, \"Leave your message at the beep.\" Then an electronic tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark,\" he said, \"it\u0027s Tom Sanders. I\u0027ve talked about Twinkle with Meredith. Her view is that we\u0027re in early production and we are shaking out the lines. She takes the position that we can\u0027t say for sure that there are any significant problems to be flagged, and that we should treat the situation as standard procedure for the bankers and C-W people tomorrow . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assistant walked out of the room, smiling at Sanders as she passed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . and that if we have problems with the drive later on that we have to get management involved with, we\u0027ll face that later. I\u0027ve given her your thoughts, and she\u0027s talking to Bob now, so presumably we\u0027ll go into the meeting tomorrow taking that position . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assistant came to the door to the office. She paused briefly to twist the lock in the doorknob, then left, closing the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders frowned. She had locked the door on her way out. It wasn\u0027t so much the fact that she had done it, but the fact that he seemed to be in the middle of an arrangement, a planned event in which everyone else understood what was going on and he did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . Well, anyway, Mark, if there is a significant change in all this, I\u0027ll contact you before the meeting tomorrow, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget that phone,\" Meredith said coming up suddenly, very close to him, pushing his hand down, and pressing her body against his. Her lips mashed against his mouth. He was vaguely aware of dropping the phone on the windowsill as they kissed and she twisted, turning away, and they tumbled over onto the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith, wait-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God, I\u0027ve wanted you all day,\" she said intensely. She kissed him again, rolling on top of him, lifting one leg to hold him down. His position was awkward but he felt himself responding to her. His immediate thought was that someone might come in. He had a vision of himself, lying on his back on the couch with his boss half-straddling him in her businesslike navy suit, and he was anxious about what the person seeing them would think, and then he was truly responding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt it too, and it aroused her more. She pulled back for a breath. \"Oh God, you feel so good, I can\u0027t stand the bastard touching me. Those stupid glasses. Oh! I\u0027m so hot, I haven\u0027t had a decent fuck-\" and then she threw herself back on him, kissing him again, her mouth mashed on him. Her tongue was in his mouth and he thought, Jesus, she\u0027s\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pushing it. He smelled her perfume, and it immediately brought back memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her body so she could reach down and touch him, and she moaned when she felt him through his trousers. She fumbled at the zipper. He had suddenly conflicting images, his desire for her, his wife and his kids, memories of the past, of being with her in the apartment in Sunnyvale, of breaking the bed. Images of his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh. Don\u0027t talk. No! No . . .\" She was gasping in little breaths, her mouth puckering rhythmically like a goldfish. He remembered that she got that way. He had forgotten until now. He felt her hot panting breath on his face, saw her flushed cheeks. She got his trousers open. Her hot hand on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus,\" she said, squeezing him, and she slid down his body, running her hands over his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Meredith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just let me,\" she said hoarsely. `Just for a minute.\" And then her mouth was on him. She was always good at this. Images flooding back to him. The way she liked to do it in dangerous places. While he was driving on the freeway. In the men\u0027s room at a sales conference. On the beach at Napili at night. The secret impulsive nature, the secret heat. When he was first introduced to her, the exec at ConTech had said, She one of the great cocksuckers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling her mouth on him, feeling his back arch as the tension ran through his body, he had the uneasy sense of pleasure and danger at once. So much had happened during the day, so many changes, everything was so sudden. He felt dominated, controlled, and at risk. He had the feeling as he lay on his back that he was somehow agreeing to a situation that he did not understand fully, that was not fully recognized. There would be trouble later. He did not want to go to Malaysia with her. He did not want an affair with his boss. He did not even want a one-night stand. Because what always happened was that people found out, gossip at the water cooler, meaningful looks in the hallway. And sooner or later the spouses found out. It always happened. Slammed doors, divorce lawyers, child custody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn\u0027t want any of that. His life was arranged now, he had things in place. He had commitments. This woman from his past understood none of that. She was free. He was not. He shifted his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you taste good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached up, and pressed her fingers over his lips. \"Ssshhh. I know you like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do like it,\" he said, \"but I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she sucked him, she was unbuttoning his shirt, pinching his nipples. He looked down and saw her straddling his legs, her head bent over him. Her blouse was open. Her breasts swung free. She reached up, took his hands, and pulled them down, placing them on her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still had perfect breasts, the nipples hard under his touch. She moaned. Her body squirming as she straddled him. He felt her warmth. He began to hear a buzzing in his ears, a suffusing intoxicated flush in his face as sounds went dull, the room seemed distant, and there was nothing but this woman and her body and his desire for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment he felt a burst of anger, a kind of male fury that he was pinned down, that she was dominating him, and he wanted to be in control, to take her. He sat up and grabbed her hair roughly, lifting her head and twisting his body. She looked in his eyes and saw instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" she said, and she moved sideways, so he could sit up beside her. He slipped his hand between her legs. He felt warmth, and lacy underpants. He tugged at them. She wriggled, helping him, and he slid them down to her knees; then she kicked them away. Her hands were caressing his hair, her lips at his ear. \"Yes,\" she whispered fiercely. \"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blue skirt was bunched up around her waist. He kissed her hard, pulling her blouse wide, pressing her breasts to his bare chest. He felt her heat all along his body. He moved his fingers, probing between her lips. She gasped as they kissed, nodding her head yes. Then his fingers were in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he was startled: she was not very wet, and then he remembered that, too. The way she would start, her words and body immediately passionate, but this central part of her slower to respond, taking her eventual arousal from his. She was always turned on most by his desire for her, and always came after he did sometimes within a few seconds, but sometimes he struggled to stay hard while she rocked against him, pushing to her own completion, lost in her own private world while he was fading. He always felt alone, always felt as if she were using him. Those memories gave him pause, and she sensed his hesitation and grabbed him fiercely, fumbling at his belt, moaning, sticking her hot tongue in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut reluctance was seeping back into him now, his angry heat was fading, and unbidden the thought flashed through his mind: It\u0027s not worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his feelings shifted again, and now he had a familiar sensation. Going back to see an old lover, being attracted over dinner, then getting involved again, feeling desire and, suddenly, in the heat of the moment, in the press of flesh, being reminded of all the things that had been wrong with the relationship, feeling old conflicts and angers and irritations rise up again, and wishing that he had never started. Suddenly thinking of how to get out of it, how to stop what was started. But usually there was no way to get out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill his fingers were inside her, and she was moving her body against his hand, shifting to be sure he would touch the right place. She was wetter, her lips were swelling. She opened her legs wider for him. She was breathing very hard, stroking him with her fingers. \"Oh God, I love the way you feel,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually there was no way to get out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body was tense and ready. Her hard nipples brushed against his chest. Her fingers caressed him. She licked the bottom of his earlobe with a quick dart of her tongue and instantly there was nothing but his desire, hot and angry, more intense for the fact that he didn\u0027t really want to be there, that he felt she had manipulated him to this place. Now he would fuck her. He wanted to fuck her. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sensed his change and moaned, no longer kissing him, leaning back on the couch, waiting. She watched him through half-closed eyes, nodding her head. His fingers still touched her, rapidly, repeatedly, making her gasp, and he turned, pushed her down on her back on the couch. She hiked up her skirt and spread her legs for him. He crouched over her and she smiled at him, a knowing, victorious smile. It made him furious to see this sense that she had somehow won, this watchful detachment, and he wanted to catch her, to make her feel as out of control as he felt, to make her part of this, to wipe that smug detachment from her face. He spread her lips but did not enter her, he held back, his fingers moving, teasing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched her back, waiting for him. \"No, no . . . please . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill he waited, looking at her. His anger was fading as quickly as it had come, his mind drifting away, the old reservations returning. In an instant of harsh clarity, he saw himself in the room, a panting middle aged, married man with his trousers down around his knees, bent over a woman on an office couch that was too small. What the hell was he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her face, saw the way the makeup cracked at the corners of her eyes. Around her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had her hands on his shoulders, tugging him toward her. \"Oh please . . . No . . . No . . .\" And then she turned her head aside and coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething snapped in him. He sat back coldly. \"You\u0027re right.\" He got off the couch, and pulled up his trousers. \"We shouldn\u0027t do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up. \"What are you doing?\" She seemed puzzled. \"You want this as much as I do. You know you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"We shouldn\u0027t do this, Meredith.\" He was buckling his belt. Stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him in dazed disbelief, like someone awakened from sleep. \"You\u0027re not serious . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a good idea. I don\u0027t feel good about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then her eyes were suddenly furious. \"You fucking .son of a bitch.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got off the couch fast, rushing at him, hitting him hard with bunched fists. \"You bastard! You prick! You fucking bastard!\" He was trying to button his shirt, turning away from her blows. \"You shit! You bastard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved around him as he turned away, grabbing his hands, tearing at his shirt to keep him from buttoning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t! You can\u0027t do this to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtons popped. She scratched him, long red welts running down his chest. He turned again, avoiding her, wanting only to get out of there. To get dressed and get out of there. She pounded his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fucker, you can\u0027t leave me like this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut it out, Meredith,\" he said. \"It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you!\" She grabbed a handful of his hair, pulling him down with surprising strength, and she bit his ear hard. He felt an intense shooting pain and he pushed her away roughly. She toppled backward, off balance, crashing against the glass coffee table, sprawling on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there, panting. \"You fucking son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith, just leave me alone.\" He was buttoning his shirt again. All he could think was: Get out of here. Get your stuff and get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for his jacket, then saw his cellular phone on the windowsill. He moved around the couch and picked up the phone. The wineglass crashed against the window near his head. He looked over and saw her standing in the middle of the room, reaching for something else to throw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll kill you!\" she said. \"I\u0027ll fucking kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough, Meredith,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell.\" She threw a small paper bag at him. It thunked against the glass and dropped to the floor. A box of condoms fell out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going home.\" He moved toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" she said. \"You go home to your wife and your little fucking family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarms went off in his head. He hesitated for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" she said, seeing him pause. \"I know all about you, you asshole. Your wife isn\u0027t fucking you, so you come in here and lead me on, you set me up and then you walk out on me, you hostile violent fucking asshole. You think you can treat women this way? You asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the doorknob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You walk out on me, you\u0027re dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back and saw her leaning unsteadily on the desk, and he thought, She\u0027s drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Meredith,\" he said. He twisted the knob, then remembered that the door had been locked. He unlocked the door and walked out, without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the outer room, a cleaning woman was emptying trash baskets from the assistants\u0027 desks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll fucking kill you for this!\" Meredith called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cleaning woman heard it, and stared at Sanders. He looked away from her, and walked straight to the elevator. He pushed the button. A moment later, he decided to take the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders stared at the setting sun from the deck of the ferry going back to Winslow. The evening was calm, with almost no breeze; the surface of the water was dark and still. He looked back at the lights of the city and tried to assess what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the ferry, he could see the upper floors of the DigiCom buildings, rising behind the horizontal gray concrete of the viaduct that ran along the water\u0027s edge. He tried to pick out Meredith\u0027s office window, but he was already too far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut here on the water, heading home to his family, slipping back into his familiar daily routine, the events of the previous hour had already begun to take on an unreal quality. He found it hard to believe that it had happened. He reviewed the events in his mind, trying to see just where he had gone wrong. He felt certain that it was all his fault, that he had misled Meredith in some important way. Otherwise, she would never have come on to him. The whole episode was an embarrassment for him, and probably for her, too. He felt guilty and miserable-and deeply uneasy about the future. What would happen now? What would she do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t even guess. He realized then that he didn\u0027t really know her at all. They had once been lovers, but that was a long time ago. Now she was a new person, with new responsibilities. She was a stranger to him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-7.html","bookId":2410,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:47 AM"}
