I had called him over an hour ago. Told him we needed to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look good, Della. Much better than the girl I left here,\" he said before stepping into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. A lot has changed,\" I said, then motioned for him to go to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently it is a good change. You look almost happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost was a stretch. I wasn\u0027t happy. I missed Woods. I missed him so much it hurt. \"Not sure if I\u0027ll be able to achieve happy, but I hope to,\" I said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp sat down in the closest chair, stretched his legs out in front of him, and looked up at me. \"Talk, Della girl. I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to South Carolina. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m going to do next but I won\u0027t be going with you. Thank you for everything. Thank you for putting up with me for the past two weeks and helping me when I needed it. What you did means more than words could ever express. I promise to pay you back every penny you spent. As soon as I get a job I\u0027ll start sending you money. I have your address.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp frowned. \"Don\u0027t send me any money. Keep it. I had fun. I had a traveling buddy for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t going to let him get away with that. I had taken two weeks of his life on the road and now he was staying in Atlanta this week while he waited on me. \"No. I\u0027m paying you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp smirked and shook his head. \"I won\u0027t argue with you right now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found out some things this week,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m not having night terrors anymore. I still have dreams and there\u0027re still bad memories but I don\u0027t get scared. The fear is gone. I just wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp\u0027s eyes went wide and he beamed at me. \"That\u0027s awesome, Della.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded because I agreed. It was amazing. I had conquered something. \"Yeah, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going back to Rosemary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure. Every minute that passed in which I didn\u0027t have a panic attack and have to fight off the fear that used to overwhelm me, I wanted to go back. I wanted to show Woods that I was complete. I wasn\u0027t broken anymore. I was whole. He could love me. I was safe to love. But had I burned that bridge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp bit his bottom lip. He did that when he was thinking. Finally, he let it pop free. \"Listen. I can\u0027t say much because it isn\u0027t my place, but go back. If you want to go back. Be brave and go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish it was that easy. \"What if he doesn\u0027t want me back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp shook his head. \"Not possible. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left him. All I left was a note. He hasn\u0027t looked for me. He must hate me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp stood up and paced back and forth in front of the fireplace while biting his bottom lip again. What was he so worked up about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him, waiting for him to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he stopped and ran his hand through his hair, pulling on the ends a little, like he was having a hard time with something. \"Tripp, what\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me hard a minute. He knew something. Is Woods dating someone else already? Surely not. Oh, God. I\u0027m going to be sick. Could he move on like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The money, it was all---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All because he was a good friend and wanted to help you, Della. Wasn\u0027t it, Tripp?\" Braden\u0027s voice startled me as she interrupted Tripp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed hard, then nodded. \"Yeah,\" he finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t what he was going to say. Braden knew what he was going to say and she had stopped him. She was keeping something from me. What was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and spun around to look at her. \"Is he with someone else?\" I asked. Just saying it ripped me into pieces. If she said yes I would crumple to the floor. I wouldn\u0027t be able to deal with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were determined. I could see she wanted to tell me but she wasn\u0027t going to. \"I think you need to go back to Rosemary and take back your man, if that\u0027s what you want. I think that if you love Woods Kerrington, then you need to be brave enough to put your heart on the line and go after him. You need to stop fearing things, Della. This is your last obstacle. Face it.\" Her voice cracked. \"Please, Della. Go get him. If you want him. Go get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had moved on. I sank back down on the couch. \"Oh, God,\" I gasped as the pain started filling every inch of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Della---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Tripp,\" Braden snapped. She wanted me to know the truth. Tripp was trying to ease my pain because he was a good guy but Braden loved me enough to be honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I go after him? He doesn\u0027t want me,\" I said, my voice no more than a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBraden knelt down in front of me. \"You are beautiful, smart, kind, and selfless, and you\u0027re the best friend I\u0027ve ever had. I love you like a sister. You are my family. I\u0027ve watched you hurt and I\u0027ve watched you hide from your fears as if they really were those monsters under your bed that your mother threatened you with. In two days I\u0027ve seen you face life with a strength I knew was in there but I\u0027d never seen you use. If you want Woods Kerrington---if he is your forever---then go get him. Don\u0027t doubt yourself. Don\u0027t doubt your importance. People don\u0027t love you and forget you, Della. You\u0027re unforgettable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my mouth to smother a sob. Braden didn\u0027t reach for me and hug me. She didn\u0027t offer words of comfort. She just knelt there and watched me. She was waiting on me to decide. She was betting on me. When the rest of the world thought I was hopeless, she bet on me. She believed in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo had Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I have one last ride?\" I asked Tripp as I raised my gaze to meet his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know it,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBraden let out a loud sob as she stood up and wrapped her arms around me. \"I\u0027m so proud of you. You did it, Della. You did it,\" she said into my hair as she cried in my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled over her shoulder at Tripp, who was getting a little teary-eyed himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a thumbs-up and winked, then he turned and walked out of the room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-30.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
