We just lost a guide, remember? And everyone else was shaken up, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward, speaking softly. \"The rest of us aren\u0027t seeing ghosts, Nikki. And Max could get his ass back from wherever he is to help out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were seated in the courtyard, and Nikki wasn\u0027t surprised when Madame came out with more coffee, pausing to fill her cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doing okay, Nikki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thanks, Madame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s not doing okay at all,\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki kicked him under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s seeing ghosts,\" Julian said, grimacing and rubbing his shin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ghosts?\" Madame said, not appearing shocked, just concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy comes and talks to her at night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian!\" Nikki could have kicked him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Nikki,\" Madame said with soft sympathy. \"This has been really hard on you, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I\u0027m not ill, guys. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know I\u0027m here for you, Nikki, if you need me,\" Madame said. She glared at Julian. \"Sometimes… well, grief and trauma can do strange things. Anytime you need to talk, you just come to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going into palm reading, picking up the tarot, Madame?\" Julian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled at him. \"What Nikki doesn\u0027t need is for her friends to make fun of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch. Sorry,\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame gave him a superior stare and moved on to the next table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to strangle you,\" Nikki hissed to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sorry, but you are seeing ghosts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not something we need to share. Not till I know what\u0027s really going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you admit you may not really be seeing ghosts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe groaned. \"Julian, I\u0027m seeing them. Whether that means that ghosts exist or that I\u0027m losing my mind, I\u0027m not sure. The point is, one way or another, I\u0027d rather not share my state of confusion with the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry… sorry,\" he murmured quickly. \"I just thought that if I said it out loud like that, it would make you… well, make you see that it\u0027s kind of crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her watch. \"Meeting here, in ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten minutes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, the day just kind of went, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time flies when you\u0027re talking to the cops, thinking you\u0027ve seen dead men walking around and explaining it all to a shrink,\" she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you know what we didn\u0027t do?\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the real lowdown on that guy… Tommyhawk or whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blackhawk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah… he came up with that picture, you recognized it, we were told the guy was dead… and you freaked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, all right, so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we didn\u0027t really find out anything about him, either. The dead guy or Blackhawk. We really should find out everything there is to find out about both of them. The entire story about the dead guy.\" He looked around, as if he was suddenly afraid of being overheard. \"Okay, point one. You may suddenly have the ability to see ghosts. Point two—my personal choice—the mind does play tricks. Because there\u0027s something in your mind that can\u0027t quite get to the front burner but should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\" Nikki demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you know something. Something you shouldn\u0027t know. And Andy knew it, too. Maybe you and Andy knew something that had to do with the guy at Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dead guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, except maybe he wasn\u0027t dead when you saw him the first time.\" He leaned closer still, a tone in his voice that sent tremors down her spine. \"Maybe he said something, maybe there was something about him… and Andy died because of it. And that… well, that wouldn\u0027t be good news for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki sat back, staring at Julian in horror. \"What on earth are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian apparently realizing mat he\u0027d really frightened her, sat back himself. \"Nothing… nothing! I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Julian… You\u0027re scaring me big-time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to scare you. I want you to be careful. Beyond careful. Until the cops get… whoever. What I\u0027m saying is that we need to understand what\u0027s going on around here. Oh, what the hell do I know? I\u0027m just a storyteller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still, we have to keep living, breathing—working. Making our lives normal, right? And look, here come the lovebirds, right on time. Right now we\u0027ve got to get on with the meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood. Nikki could see Patricia and Nathan coming their way, both carrying cups of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced a smile, still plagued with goose bumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Julian thought that she knew something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll she had done was give a guy twenty bucks. A guy who had wound up dead. And she was really seeing ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he was feeling increasingly curious about Nikki DuMonde, Brent decided his best use of the early afternoon would be a few hours spent in the local library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered why he hadn\u0027t thought to come here before. Maybe he had just considered old Huey to be something of a whiner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing up with a Lakota heritage had taught him a lot about bitterness and chips on the shoulder, but the past was just that—the past—and now people needed to focus on entering the twenty-first century, reaping the benefits of progress and technology, without losing sight of a heritage that was something precious, something to be preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Huey\u0027s case, though, he had lived in the past. His tormentor had a name. He should have looked into Huey\u0027s situation before this; he owed it to the old ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProperty records had been computerized by some wondrous soul, and once he had homed in on the right records using the family name, Brent had little difficulty finding Huey\u0027s sadistic master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchibald McManus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently old Archibald had inherited the plantation from his father, who had worked hard to bring the property along. He\u0027d married three times, and his wives had not fared well, either, each of them dying within a few years of her marriage. Each marriage had produced a single child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1861, soon after the outbreak of war but before New Orleans had been taken over by the Yankees, there had been a slave revolt. The plantation had caught fire. There was no mention of what had happened to the three McManus children, but Archibald\u0027s body had been found in the burned-out ruins of the grand foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a happy ending. Not a death you would wish on anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod alone knew whether or not McManus had practiced a brutality that had not only robbed his slaves of their natural lifespan but of his young brides\u0027, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcManus\u0027s remains had been interred on the property—public land now, having reverted to the parish of New Orleans. That was it. There was nothing more on any descendants. Wife one had borne a girl, Theresa, in 1848, wife two, a son, Alfred, in 1855, and wife three, another girl, Editha, in 1857. They must have left the area. There were no records regarding the family after the fire and the discovery of Archibald\u0027s body, and the ensuing reversion of the property to the parish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent ran off the pages, folded them, paid the copy fee and thanked the very helpful librarian. He decided not to head to the cemetery then—it would be filled with tourists and tour groups that came by day, since visitations at night were fiercely discouraged by the local police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he returned to the police station, wondering if he would even find Detectives Massey and Joulette in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact they were both at their desks, entangled in paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Blackhawk, what brings you back?\" Massey asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering if you\u0027d let me see what you\u0027ve got on the Andrea Ciello case,\" Brent told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoulette immediately stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there might be a connection,\" Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey frowned. \"That\u0027s what you said. But I don\u0027t see how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you humor me?\" Brent asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was certain that Joulette was about to tell him no, but instead, he went stiffer, looking past Brent, toward the entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent turned and saw that a man was coming toward the detectives\u0027 desks. He was tall and lean, with dark hair clipped close to his head, Ray-Bans and a black suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to reek of being a federal officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, fellows,\" the man said, nodding curtly and looking a little curiously toward Brent. \"I needed to see if you\u0027d come up with anything new,\" he said to Massey and Joulette. \"Who the hell are you?\" he asked Brent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey stood. \"Vince Haggerty, this is Brent Blackhawk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaggerty had apparently heard Brent\u0027s name. He didn\u0027t look pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you were going to be in the way, although I heard you\u0027d be here,\" Haggerty said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent looked around. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m actually in the way, though quarters are tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do life-and-death work,\" Haggerty told him, his tone dismissing Brent as if he were a candy-selling Boy Scout taking up space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to hear it,\" Brent murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have anything new,\" Massey said, staring at Haggerty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hold back on me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, I wish I had something to hold back!\" Massey said, his frustration evident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you actually doing anything?\" Haggerty asked bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell no, we\u0027re just sitting here with our thumbs up our asses,\" Joulette said, obviously furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our crime scene guys didn\u0027t give us a hell of a lot to go on, and gee—neither did yours,\" Massey reminded Haggerty, his expression bland. \"So we\u0027ve been hitting the streets. Bar after bar, looking for witnesses. Anyone who might have seen your guy. Eventually we\u0027ll catch a break. And we\u0027ll catch that break because we\u0027re doing things—like pounding the streets. You can feel free to do the same.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-17.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
