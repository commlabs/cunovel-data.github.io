Jiang Fei had been too rash, using the self sacrifice skill in the first round. Although it might not be as damaging to oneself as the Flame of Life Skill, it would still take her at least half a month to fully recover. Without her power as the mainstay, how could the Mi’Ou Battle Team possibly reach second in the group, especially with this round likely being a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old man abruptly appeared out of nowhere, dressed in the robes of the ZhongTian Skill Storing Palace, but with a purple-gold crown on his head. Walking slowly, almost casually, he stepped into the air as if walking up the stairs, and in moments he stood above the tournament stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his right hand, he pressed downwards in the air towards the stage, and it was clear to the observers that the air seemed to twist violently as a silver light flashed. In the next instant, the huge stage that was still being corroded suddenly vanished, with not even a speck of dust to show it was once there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the battle team members who had been chatting animatedly amongst themselves were suddenly silenced by that sight, as if their necks had been gripped by an invisible vice. The entire plaza fell into a strange silence as they watched in fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, several men dressed in the ZhongTian Skill Storing Palace uniform came out one after the other, supporting a huge Diamond Rock. Within the time taken to brew a pot of tea, a brand new stage had been built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man floating in the air said passively: “Let the tournament continue then.” After saying that, he seemed to take a step forward in midair, vanishing instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one observed very carefully, one might discover that in the corner of the VIP Stage, a person appeared suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYe Paopao swallowed hard, saying with some difficulty: “What sort of power level is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing sighed and said: “Spatial Attribute… If I’ve not guessed wrongly, he is likely a King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master with the Spatial Attribute. Ahhh, damn, just too strong! No wonder they say that from the nine Jeweled cultivation level onwards, it’s a whole new frontier. Just like that old man just now, I’m sure he could take out all of us twenty four battle teams easily without breaking a sweat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter saying that, Zhou Weiqing stood back up and headed towards the stage, while a short, plump youth walked forward from the Mi’Ou Battle Team at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge had also changed, and the new one said solemnly: “Fei Li Battle Team versus Mi’Ou Battle Team, fourth fight, one versus one, both participants please introduce yourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fei Li Battle Team, Zhou Weiqing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mi’Ou Battle Team, Little Worm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn hearing his opponent’s name, Zhou Weiqing almost laughed, thinking to himself: \u003ci\u003eWith your size, you’re still called Little Worm? You should be called Meat Worm!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Begin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the judge shouted, the fight officially started, and both sides sprang into action. Little Worm took two abrupt steps back, his stubby arms lifting up as a thick yellow light shone forth. Instantly, a tall earth wall sprang up in front of him like an immense shield, and his next movement was actually to push this three yard wide, 2 yard tall wall as he charged towards Zhou Weiqing with it in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat was that about? \u003c/i\u003eZhou Weiqing couldn’t help but think curiously as he released his own Heavenly Jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Worm ran rather quickly, and wall after wall rose rapidly on the stage, closing in from both sides of Zhou Weiqing, boxing him in and restricting his movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Little Worm unleashed his earth walls, Zhou Weiqing saw the Physical Jewels around his right hand; similar to his own, there were three Icy Jade signifying the Strength Attribute. As Zhou Weiqing had expected, the three members who had appeared in the first three fights were already the most powerful amongst the Mi’Ou Battle Team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching Little Worm push the earth walls towards him, Zhou Weiqing suddenly understood what he was trying to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, he was afraid of his arrows, and was using these earth walls to restrict his movement and his arrows. As for pushing the wall towards him in a charge, it was likely to use that to knock him off the platform. Although this plan was rather strange, against an ordinary archer and with the rules of the tournament of fighting on the platform, it would have some chance of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, Zhou Weiqing was no ordinary archer, and was also a Strength Heavenly Jewel Master. Furthermore, just like Crow, his strength was far beyond any normal Strength Heavenly Jewel Master!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Little Worm’s wall reached almost ten yards from Zhou Weiqing, and just as Zhou Weiqing was about to react, he suddenly felt his body dip down in a strong sense of pressure. The entire platform seemed to be filled with a strange power drawing his body down, impeding all his movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat is this? Increased Gravity? \u003c/i\u003eZhou Weiqing was caught by surprise. After all, amongst all the Earth Attribute Skills, this was a powerful nine star rated skill. Just a single Jeweled level was able to double gravity, and each Jewel would increase it by another 100% [1. Edited, thanks for the comments. If the description isn\u0027t clear, each Jewel adds a fold on top of current gravity eg. 1 Jewel \u003d +100% gravity , 2 Jewel \u003d +200% gravity, 3 Jewel \u003d +300% gravity, so on so forth]. With three Jewels, Little Worm could already increase gravity by threefold. Although this Skill had a huge drain on Heavenly Energy and also with an area of effect, it was extremely rare to be found on a three-Jeweled cultivation level Heavenly Jewel Master. It could be seen as a yellow glow around Zhou Weiqing’s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the increased gravity was activated, Little Worm abruptly accelerated, using his full power, hoping to seize the chance to quickly knock Zhou Weiqing off the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eImpressive, this increased gravity Skill! \u003c/i\u003eZhou Weiqing praised in his heart. Clearly, Little Worm had noticed that he was also a Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, and just using his own strength behind the Earth Wall alone would likely be insufficient to deal with Zhou Weiqing. However, this Increased Gravity was something like a surprise attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, once again, the phrase was ‘Great plan, but alas, he had met Zhou Weiqing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a step forward and dipping his shoulder to brace himself, Zhou Weiqing prepared to take the incoming wall directly. Although he was under all the increase gravity, it did not affect Zhou Weiqing from preparing himself in such a stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*BANG* A loud crash resounded across the plaza as the earth wall slammed savagely onto Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder, as Little Worm exerted all his power. However, the wall still held still, not moving a single inch further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the earth wall, Little Worm had exerted his considerable strength to his absolute maximum, but still found that he could not budge the wall any further. As for Zhou Weiqing, he also had a look of absolute concentration and strain, his forehead full of sweat, as if he was having the worst time of his life but holding on through sheer resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the Rest House, Crow who was seated beside Shangguan Bing’er said: “Bing’er, your man sure knows how to act.” After all, it was just a mere Earth Wall and a Three-Jeweled opponent, how could he possibly have so much trouble holding on? If that was his strength, she would definitely not have lost to him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er giggled, and Ye Paopao shook his head at the other side, saying: “Sister Crow, this is a tactic. After all, the Mi’Ou Battle Team isn’t our real opponent. Didn’t you also hide your true power; you didn’t even unleash your Elemental Jewels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two on the stage were stuck in a stalemate situation, but the other members of the Mi’Ou Battle Team had an ugly expression on their faces. After all, even though both sides seemed to be struggling at their maximum, they were clear that with the extra use of the Increase Gravity Skill and Earth Walls, Little Worm’s drain on Heavenly Energy was definitely a lot greater. Such a stalemate situation actually already signified his loss. In truth, Little Worm’s combat abilities weren’t that strong, but he had been lucky enough to Store the Increase Gravity Skill, earning him a spot on the team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, as time went past, both men stood locked in the same stalemate, their faces almost warped from the exertions. Little Worm’s pushing power slowly grew weaker, while Zhou Weiqing’s resistance also grew weaker at nearly the same rate. As such, they both maintained the stalemate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this victory, Little Worm was putting in everything he had, almost willing to lay his life down. Alas, sometimes, the heart is strong but the body is weak, and eventually his Heavenly Energy ran out. By that time, he was unable to maintain the Increase Gravity and Earth Walls, collapsing to the ground on his butt, panting heavily as sweat covered soaked his entire shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s acting was top notch as usual. When his opponent’s skills vanished, he even stumbled to the front before ‘barely’ regaining his balance, panting just as heavily. However, he still stood there, hands to his hips, looking the very picture of ‘I’m on the verge of dropping as well, but I will hold on!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the start of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, this could be said to be the weirdest series. The unbelievably violent Crow, the Darkness Self Sacrifice Skill, two sides pushing on a wall… each and every fight was just so strange, so weird...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge looked at the two panting participants, almost speechless, before he finally proclaimed the result: “The fourth fight, Fei Li Battle Team’s victory. Third Group, First Series, Fei Li Battle Team defeats the Mi’Ou Battle Team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing raised his hands smugly, before generously offering his hand to help Little Worm up, saying with a sigh of sympathy: “Bro, it was a close fight. Great fight indeed! Good luck in your next fight.” After saying that, he descended the stage and returned to the Rest House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the VIP stage, the ZhongTian Emperor Shangguan Tianxin looked towards Shangguan Longyin beside him and smiled faintly, saying: “Longyin, what do you think of that little rascal just now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Longyin said: “Earlier, he used at least the Spatial and Lightning Attributes, combined with his Consolidated Bow, he certainly has something going for him. That Spatial Rend Skill is from the Silver Emperor, and I heard that not longer ago the Fei Li Skill Storing Palace managed to capture one… but I really do not know how they managed to get this little High Level Shi Master to actually succeed in Storing the Skill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianxin smiled and said: “I have the feeling that the little rascal is not as simple as he looks. Earlier, that little girl from the Mi’Ou Empire lost control inexplicably… From what I see, there has to be some connection with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Longyin’s expression changed slightly as his brow arched: “Your Majesty is indeed observant. I will observe him carefully for the next few rounds, let’s see what he has up his sleeve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, on the two sides of the Fei Li Battle Team Rest House, the members of the seeded teams had a rather disdainful look on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pale faced, frail looking youth said: “The Fei Li Battle Team this year is at such a level this year? Three members, two of them three-Jeweled and one four-Jeweled. They are even weaker than last Tournament. Looks like, this year they will not even be able to keep their fifth position. It looks like it will be likely that the Bai Da Battle Team will ascend together with us then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-74-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-74-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-74-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
