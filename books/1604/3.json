I have never wondered if I am short, but he makes me feel tiny. I can smell him all around me. His smell makes my insides hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Leo who walks up to Anna and nuzzles her, encouraging her to start walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitor.\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake laughs again, \"She\u0027s really good with animals. It\u0027s the only friggen reason we are still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what that means. Is she going to try to eat my wolf? She doesn\u0027t look like the kind of kid who hugs and pets her food before eating it. I\u0027m not sure there are even kids who do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk the short bit back to my cabin in silence. He tries talking but I just listen, not to him but everything around us. This isn’t how I want to die and I don\u0027t know how much noise they\u0027ve made thus far. He doesn’t seem to have a clue how to be quiet. His sister is the opposite. She listens like I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel considerably better when I smell the fire of my cabin and see my front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find this place?\" He asks when I open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my finger to my lips and creep in with my rifle raised. I never locked the door. Another rule I\u0027ve broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear each of the two rooms and the bathroom. I check the closets and then turn the small lantern on, creating a tiny warm orange glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hops along the couch and sits down, grimacing in pain. My house feels exposed. No one has ever been here before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake you\u0027re going to be okay, right?\" Anna kneels in front of him and looks back at me. I lock the door and close the curtains completely. I feel vulnerable. His eyes watching me make me feel worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need them gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be fine, just let me take a look.\" I bring the lantern and sit on the floor beside her, \"Go sit by the fire and warm up. There is a stew on top. Get a bowl and eat.\" She doesn’t have to be asked twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him. He lays his head back on the couch and looks like he will fall asleep at any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk, knowing he will be wide-awake the moment I touch the break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t scream okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts his head and smiles bitterly, \"I screamed like a little girl when I fell in the damned hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a breath and put my fingers to his button on his jeans and undo them. My fingers tremble. I have not touched anyone in ten years. It\u0027s been me and Leo for eight. He\u0027s all I\u0027ve touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"Don’t I get any stew before you try to take my pants off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at him, \"No, you\u0027ll throw up and we don’t waste food here.\" I don’t appreciate the awkward joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs weakly, gripping the couch with his massive hands. I unzip the pants and start to gently pull them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would probably be enjoying this if it weren’t for the unbearable pain. I need to get injured more often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stomach flexes, revealing muscles like I have never seen before. His hipbones stick out a little too much, but otherwise his body is strong and amazing. He looks like the men on the cover of granny\u0027s romance novels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to slide the jeans down his hairy legs just below his grey underwear. I try not to notice his grey underwear or what\u0027s beneath them. I try to pull the pants down but they get caught on his thigh. I grimace. He cries out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have seen disgusting things in my life and as I feel around his thigh for the break I prepare myself for the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately there is no break, but a large piece of wood has pierced his leg. I don’t think it\u0027s hit the big artery in his leg. His blood loss is nowhere what it could be if it had been pierced. I wonder about removing the stick and what damage will be caused. I don’t actually know where the artery is, I just know there is one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your leg isn’t broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at me, \"What? I felt the bone sticking out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a stick not bone. A stick must have stabbed into you. I need some things. I\u0027m going to have to cut the pants from your body though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna speaks though mouthfuls, \"I can sew them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don’t watch this Jake. Just lie back and give me a minute to get everything I need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and lays his head back. I walk to my bathroom and sit on the earth friendly toilet, my grandpa had installed because my grandma refused to use the outhouse any longer. It runs when the weather is good but in the winter it\u0027s useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit and cry in the dark. I look at my filthy hands. Even in the dark I can see the dirt. I could cause an infection and he would die from that. I could pull the stick out, rupturing his artery and he could die from that. I don’t know exactly where the artery is. I wish I\u0027d read more of the books than I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what my options are, but the thought of him dying hurts me more than any possible loss I could face, beyond Leo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my family and the years of life experience that have brought to this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI light the bathroom candle and stand to see my reflection in the mirror. I am a ghostly girl in the muted light of the candle. My mother\u0027s bracelet and necklace glisten in the dark light. I forgot I put them on when I got home. I lightly touch the metal. I wish she were here. Not just her, any adult. I don’t want to do what I\u0027m about to do. I grab my medical kit and take a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the kitchen and pour a pot of water and place it on the counter, \"Boil this now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna hops up and grabs it. She stokes the fire and puts the pot on it. I am glad I don\u0027t have to tell her how to do it. She is capable. I like her for a moment. I close my heart and turn away from her. She still has to leave when all of this is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the whiskey from the cupboard and crack the bottle. I\u0027ve never opened it. I pour some on my hands, it stings a little. I scrub my hands and pour more on. I dry my hands with a towel from my fresh laundry pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drink a swig of the whiskey and carry it to my couch. My throat is burning. I grab a thick blanket and put it under his leg. He moans slightly. He is falling asleep. I take the scissors and will my hands to be steady. I cut the fabric away quickly, trying to stay along the seam to make it easier to sew back. I pull the pants off completely and pass them to Anna, \"The sewing kit is in the bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back and look around his leg at the stick. It is about half an inch thick and looks to be flaking slightly. This might be a problem. It has gone in and broken off. It\u0027s gone in deep. I grimace as I touch the opening of the cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to my tool bag and grab a wrench. I pour the whiskey over it and my hands again. I drink another swig. The fire is inside my belly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna returns with the sewing kit and looks at his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least the stick went in to the side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and pass her the whiskey, \"He\u0027s going to scream when I do this. You need to put a pillow over his face and hold him down. I will need that boiled water the minute it\u0027s ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a drink of the whiskey and nods, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop to my knees and place the old wrench around the nub of the stick. I tighten it so the bark makes a very slight crunching noise. I look at the blanket I have ready and take a deep breath. Anna goes around to the back of the couch holding a pillow and wraps her arms around her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try not to think about what I\u0027m about to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, two, three.\" I pull the stick hard and fast, ripping it from his leg. He jerks as hard as he can, kicking me in the face with his other foot. I am suddenly on my back on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screams but his sister and the pillow muffle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see stars for a moment but find my back to him. I pick the whiskey back up and pour it all over his wound. He screams again, ripping the pillow off his face and shoving his sister off of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FUCK! FUCK! WARN ME NEXT TIME!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me like he could rip my head off. He scares me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I\u0027m going to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tear slips from his left eye but he nods. His jaw trembles slightly from the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the wound, blood rushes out. The flow is lazy, it isn’t the artery. I sigh, at least that won\u0027t kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured more alcohol and mop up the blood and liquor. I push a towel against the wound and wait for his body\u0027s natural clotting to at least make an attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I look down at the wound I see blood dripping onto my hands. I touch my fingers to my face. My nose is bleeding heavily. I grab the other towel beside me and push it against my face. Leo nudges me to check. I rub my elbow against his fur to try to soothe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you learn to stitch someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back over at my guest and frown, \"My dad was a survivalist. He made me go to survivor camp every summer and took me hunting and camping all the time. When it all started he planned for us to come here. The book shelves are lined with his survival books and manuals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowns, \"Did he come with you or did you come here alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt flashes in my eyes, my father is pinned by the truck. He reaches for me and whispers his love. I can see them coming as I feel his fingers pushing me away. My feet listen to him and start running. They move against my wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake it off and look at her, \"Where are your parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes blank like mine, \"Mom died of sicknesses in the beginning. She went to work and never came home. She was part of the first quarantined. Dad, well he\u0027s gone. He\u0027s gone too.\" Her voice quivers a little. I know that feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all gone Anna. All that’s left is us and them.\" I almost twitch when I say the words us and them. I included her in my us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer small face is blank. I know that feeling too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anna.\" A sleepy voice comes from the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is up and out of the bed, before I can even pull the covers back on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s burning up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and walk into the room stretching, \"Good. His body is fighting the infection. The bark of the branch was really flakey. I tried to flush the wound as best as I could but some bark might still be in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a small spark as the back of my hand rests against the balmy skin of his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hand in his. It\u0027s a moment of intimacy I\u0027ve never had before. I don’t pull away but I don’t know how to react. He squeezes my hand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-3.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:01 PM"}
