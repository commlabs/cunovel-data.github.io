Simply put, the first strike had been using the ‘crying-face’ Hammer, while the second was with the ‘smiling-face’ Hammer. As for the reason why Shangguan Tianyue looked so critically injured, naturally the majority of it was self inflicted.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePreviously, Shangguan Tianyue had already informed Zhou Weiqing that he could handle the severity of his own injuries.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe reason why Zhou Weiqing had gone all out in the fight against Shangguan Tianyue was twofold. Firstly, he was afraid that Shangguan Tianyang would see through their act if he held back too much. Secondly, he also wanted to test his strength, to see how far he had come. With a Heavenly Emperor willing to fight against him without malice, this was naturally a good opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe facts had once again proven that old ginger is always the spiciest\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e.

Ming Yu truly lived up to his title as the Fei Li God General.

There were watchtowers erected in all positions, and groups of patrolling cavalry weaved in and out of the camp areas. Once there was any suspicious stirrings, the entire army could be mobilized easily in this formation without being in a mess. Furthermore, no matter if it was the soldiers going through drill practice, or the various patrols, it was clear that they were orderly and disciplined.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt had to be known. From the time that Ming Yu had joined up with the ZhongTian Empire, barely two years had passed. In this short period of time, he had forged the Heavenly Bow Empire armies into its current state, to have such powerful combat abilities.
