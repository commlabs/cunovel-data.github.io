Metal furniture from a doctor\u0027s office. The dining room windows have frosted glass. Custom-made chairs circle a table that was purchased at Christie\u0027s at auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into the bedroom to check my messages, since a flashing light indicates five more people have called since I left the club twenty minutes ago. In the bedroom, a Chippendale mirror that Dad sent hangs over a mahogany sleigh bed made in Virginia in the nineteenth century, or so they say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m thinking of buying a Dalmatian. Gus Frerotte\u0027s in town. Cameron Diaz called. And then Matt Dillon. And then Cameron Diaz called again. And then Matt Dillon called again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flip on the TV in the bedroom. Videos, the usual. I switch over to the Weather Channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretch, groaning, my arms held high above my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to run a bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carefully hang up the Prada jacket. I\u0027m thinking, That\u0027s the last time you\u0027re wearing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom I lean over the white porcelain tub and turn the faucets, making sure the water is hot. I add some Kiehl\u0027s bath salts, mixing them around with my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m thinking of buying a Dalmatian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep stretching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething on the floor of the bathroom catches my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a tiny circle, made of paper. I press my index finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring my hand up to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a piece of confetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at it for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small black wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt starts curling toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasually, I start whistling as I move slowly back into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027m in the bedroom I notice that confetti-pink and white and gray-has been dumped all over the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring into the Chippendale mirror over the bed, I brace myself before glimpsing the shadow behind an eighteenth-century tapestry screen that stands in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow moves slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s waiting. It has that kind of stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move over to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill whistling casually, I lean toward the nightstand and, laughing to myself, pretending to struggle with the laces on the shoes I\u0027m kicking off, I reach into a drawer and pull out a.25-caliber Walther with a silencer attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start padding back toward the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m counting to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive, four, three-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately change direction and move straight up to the screen, the gun raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGauging head level, I pull the trigger. Twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled grunt. A wet sound-blood spraying against a wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure dressed in black, half his face destroyed, falls forward, toppling over the screen, a small gun clenched in the gloved fist of his right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to bend over and pull the gun out of his hand when movement behind my back causes me to whirl around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently leaping toward me over the bed, now above me, an oversized knife in an outstretched hand, is another figure clad in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly I take aim, crouching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first bullet whizzes past him, punching into the Chippendale mirror, shattering it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he falls onto me, the second bullet catches him in the face, its impact throwing him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lies on the carpet, kicking. I stagger up and quickly fire two bullets into his chest. He immediately goes still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, shit, shit,\" I\u0027m cursing, fumbling for a cell phone, dialing a number I only half remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three tries, a transmission signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punch in the code, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother signal. Another code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I dial another number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s DAN\". I say into the mouthpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I listen. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give the location. I say the words \"Code 50.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang up. I turn off the bathwater and quickly pack an overnight bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave before the cleaners arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend the night at the Carlyle Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet Eva for dinner the next night at a supertrendy new Japanese restaurant just above SoHo, in the newly glam area of Houston Street, and Eva\u0027s sipping green tea at a booth in the packed main room, waiting patiently, an advance copy of the New York Observer (with a particularly favorable article about my father that\u0027s really about the new Victor Johnson and all the things he\u0027s learned) folded on the table next to where she\u0027s resting her wrists. I\u0027m shown to our booth a little too enthusiastically by the maitre d\u0027, who holds my hand, offers condolences, tells me I look ultracool. I take it in stride and thank him as I slide in next to Eva. Eva and I just smile at each other. I remember to kiss her. I remember to go through the motions, since everyone\u0027s looking at us, since that\u0027s the point of the booth, since that\u0027s the point of this appearance. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-225.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
