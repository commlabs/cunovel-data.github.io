When I was younger and I used to bake, my cakes would melt in your mouth.\" She turned to Dana. \"Isn\u0027t that true, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melt in your mouth\" would have been the last phrase that came to Dana\u0027s mind, but it was not important. \"Absolutely, Mother,\" she said with a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding ceremony had been performed by a judge at City Hall. Dana had invited her mother at the last minute, after a telephone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling, I didn\u0027t marry that dreadful man after all. You and Kemal were right about him, so I\u0027m back in Las Vegas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened, Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found out that he already had a wife. She didn\u0027t like him, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So here I am alone again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonelywas the implication. So Dana had invited her to the wedding. Seeing her mother chatting with Kemal and even remembering his name, Dana smiled. We\u0027ll turn her into a grandmother yet. Her happiness seemed too immense to absorb. Just being married to Jeff was a blissful miracle, but there was more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the fire, Jeff and Kemal had briefly gone to the hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation. While they were there, a nurse talked to a reporter about Kemal\u0027s adventures and the story had been picked up by the media. Kemal\u0027s photograph was in the newspapers and his story was told on television. A book was being written about his experiences and there was even talk of a television series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But only if I get to star in it,\" Kemal insisted. Kemal was the hero of his school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the adoption ceremony took place, half of Kemal\u0027s schoolmates turned out to applaud him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal said, \"I\u0027m really adopted now, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re really adopted,\" Dana and Jeff said. \"We belong to one another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rad.\"Wait until Ricky Underwood hears about this. Ha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terrible nightmare of the past month was gradually fading away. The three of them were a family now, and home was a safe haven. I don\u0027t need any more adventures, Dana thought. I\u0027ve had enough to last me a lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning, Dana announced, \"I just found a great new apartment for the four of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the three of us,\" Jeff corrected her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dana said softly. \"The four of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff was staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She means she\u0027s having a baby,\" Kemal explained. \"I hope it\u0027s a boy. We can shoot hoops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more good news to come. Crime Line \u0027s opening show, \"The Roger Hudson Story, A Murder Conspiracy,\" received both critical acclaim and phenomenal ratings. Matt Baker and Elliot Cromwell were elated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better get a place ready to put your Emmy,\" Elliot Cromwell told Dana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one sobering note. Rachel Stevens had succumbed to cancer. The story had been printed in the newspapers, and Dana and Jeff were aware of what had happened. But when the story appeared on the TelePrompTer, Dana looked at it and choked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t read it,\" she whispered to Richard Melton. So he had read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRest in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were doing the eleven o\u0027clock broadcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...And here at home, a guardsman in Spokane, Washington, is charged with the murder of a sixteen-year-old prostitute and is suspected in the deaths of sixteen others...In Sicily, the body of Malcolm Beaumont, the seventy-year-old heir to a steel fortune, was found drowned in a swimming pool. Beaumont was honeymooning with his twenty-five-year-old bride. They were accompanied by the bride\u0027s two brothers. Now, here\u0027s the weather with Marvin Greer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the broadcast was over, Dana went in to see Matt Baker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something is bothering me, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it? Name it and I\u0027ll slay it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the story about that seventy-year-old millionaire who drowned in a swimming pool while he was honeymooning with his twenty-five-year-old bride.
