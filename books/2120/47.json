But they won\u0027t find them there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they will already have disappeared,\" Lawrence said. \"It will not be easy to catch them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until you read the truth in the blood memory. I suspected, but I did not know. It is not the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did you do nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing?\" Lawrence asked with a smile. \"I saved an innocent girl from death. I wouldn\u0027t call that nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you should have sent someone to Kingsley\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you waited--and they are gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence nodded. \"Yes, they are gone. But at least we know we were on the right track. Priscilla DuPont was killed not just as a show of their growing power, but because she had come close to discovering who was harboring the Silver Blood on the Conclave. In fact, she was about to confront the perpetrator when the explosion happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was going to name the Martins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what does that prove?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It proves Cordelia and I were right all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But with the Martins gone...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Martins were not the only suspects,\" Lawrence said. \"They were merely foot soldiers, pawns, made to do the bidding of their masters. If what she told me is true, there is another family, still in the dark, who harbors the Silver Blood, who has been instrumental in bringing about Lucifer\u0027s return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" \"That, Schuyler, is what we have to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler processed this information. The Martins had shown their hand, but there was still a puppet master offstage manipulating the strings. She thought of the files Priscilla DuPont had collected before she had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandfather, whatever happened to Maggie Stanford? Does anyone know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence shook his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forces--Charles, Jack, and Mimi--walked out of the courtroom together. Relief was evident in all of their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack approached Schuyler. \"Thank you,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou kissed me, Schuyler thought. She remembered what else he had said that night...How do you know he\u0027s not interested? You might be surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he know she knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to touch his cheek, to kiss his soft skin again, but she saw Mimi scowling. Even if Mimi Force owed her her life, it didn\u0027t mean she was going to be nice to Schuyler any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" she told Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles joined them. \"When we return to New York, I\u0027ll have my driver come by and pick up your belongings. We\u0027ve already cleared the guest bedroom for you. I think you\u0027ll find it to your liking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Schuyler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Dad, what the hell?\" Mimi interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grandfather has failed to mention it, I see.\" Charles smiled grimly. \"Lawrence, you might have won the leadership of the Coven, but I have won the adoption battle. Schuyler, the Red Blood courts have decided, in their infinite wisdom, to put you in my custody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandfather...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. The appeals have been rejected,\" Lawrence said, his head bowed low. \"Charles, I did not realize you would insist on this. I\u0027m sorry, Schuyler. I\u0027ll continue to fight it, but for now, you\u0027re going to have to live with the Forces. Charles, there is no need to send for Schuyler. I will drop her off myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi glared at Schuyler, while Jack only looked shocked. Live with them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they crazy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler looked from one twin to the other, and realized she had just survived the blood trial only to find herself facing a new and more complicated challenge. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-47.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
