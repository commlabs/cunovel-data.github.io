Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field. He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in Nestor\u0027s chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship) sent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that manner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in Achilles\u0027 armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also wounded, and assists him in that distress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the monument of Ilus.\n\u003cbr\u003e The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,219\n\u003cbr\u003e Now rose refulgent from Tithonus\u0027 bed;\n\u003cbr\u003e With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,\n\u003cbr\u003e And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:\n\u003cbr\u003e When baleful Eris, sent by Jove\u0027s command,\n\u003cbr\u003e The torch of discord blazing in her hand,\n\u003cbr\u003e Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,\n\u003cbr\u003e And, wrapt in tempests, o\u0027er the fleet descends.\n\u003cbr\u003e High on Ulysses\u0027 bark her horrid stand\n\u003cbr\u003e She took, and thunder\u0027d through the seas and land.\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 196]\n\u003cbr\u003e Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,\n\u003cbr\u003e Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,\n\u003cbr\u003e Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng\n\u003cbr\u003e With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:\n\u003cbr\u003e The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms\n\u003cbr\u003e Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e No more they sigh, inglorious to return,\n\u003cbr\u003e But breathe revenge, and for the combat

bound\n\u003cbr\u003e The squires restrain\u0027d: the foot, with those who wield\n\u003cbr\u003e The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.\n\u003cbr\u003e To second these, in close array combined,\n\u003cbr\u003e The squadrons spread their sable wings behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,\n\u003cbr\u003e As with the light the warriors\u0027 toils
