What have you got in mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Chamber of Commerce is having an open house. Wanna go?” Jack’s suggestive tone implied a night of passionate lovemaking, not a rather dull business event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just might be able to fit it into my busy social calendar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I pick you up at seven?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seven’s good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wear something sexy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the Chamber of Commerce?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Olivia,” he said blandly, “for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile lasted a long time after the conversation had ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Olivia got home, she called Shelly Larson. After a lengthy explanation of who she was and why she’d phoned, she waited for a response to her invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Eric know about this?” Shelly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was soft and well-modulated. Olivia tried to match it to the photograph Eric had once shown her. As she recalled, Shelly was a petite brunette who worked for a Seattle-based advertising agency. She’d been living with Eric for almost two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack suggested I invite you,” Olivia said. “I agreed on the condition that neither of you walked into this blind. He’s hoping you and Eric can settle things once and for all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelly didn’t respond; apparently she was still considering the invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have family in the area?” Olivia asked, wanting to get some idea of Shelly’s support system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No—my mother died when I was a baby and my dad hasn’t really been part of my life. I was raised by my grandmother, but she’s been gone for three years now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re on your own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She didn’t seem interested in continuing with that theme. Instead, she burst out, “I just don’t understand why Eric doesn’t believe the baby is his. It’s an insult to me and to everything I stand for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia certainly didn’t want to take sides. According to Jack, his son was incapable of fathering children, but stranger things had happened. “Men are just dense sometimes,” she said, hoping she sounded sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I very much appreciate the dinner invitation,” Shelly said, her voice gaining strength and conviction, “but I have to refuse. Eric and I are finished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not if you’re carrying his child,” Olivia reminded her. “In that case, the relationship is far from over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter. Eric doesn’t believe me, and as far as I’m concerned, the courts can deal with this. I don’t want to put a damper on your Thanksgiving—that wouldn’t be fair to you or Jack or your other guests. It was very thoughtful of Jack to want to include me, but it just won’t work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia didn’t feel comfortable ending the conversation just yet, now that she knew Shelly was alone in the world. “I’d like to keep in touch, Shelly, if you don’t mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess that would be okay. Jack has a right to know his grandchild.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hung up shortly afterward, and Olivia stood there, thinking over what had been said. The young woman had shown extraordinary wisdom in declining the invitation, in Olivia’s opinion. She could sense how badly Shelly wanted to be included in the festivities, yet she’d refused, knowing that the others would be made uncomfortable by the situation between her and Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack arrived promptly at seven. “Well?” he asked hopefully. “Did you talk to Shelly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did, and she turned us down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Jack groaned and ran all ten fingers through his hair in abject frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did Eric say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’d come to dinner if Shelly came, but otherwise he was thinking of joining a few of his friends over in Kirkland where he works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe that’s for the best,” Olivia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not for me,” Jack cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not for them either, Olivia supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn, I was counting on better news than this.” He slumped onto her chair, then reached inside his jacket. “I’ve had this for weeks and was waiting for the right time to give it to you.” He took out a gaily wrapped package. “It’s your birthday gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him in complete astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead,” he urged. “Open it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia took the gift, sat down next to Jack and untied the ribbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry it’s late,” he said, watching her anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peeled away the paper and lifted the lid of a gray velvet box. The instant she saw the diamond tennis bracelet, she let out a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like it?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack, I…I’m not sure what to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted you to know how important you are to me, Olivia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jack…” She struggled to tell him how thrilled she was and then decided that words weren’t necessary. With great care she set the box aside and slipped her arms around Jack’s neck, kissing him in a way that would leave him in no doubt of her appreciation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanksgiving would be a quiet day for Grace with just Maryellen for company. The divorce had been declared final on Monday. She didn’t have to appear in court; Mark Spellman had phoned her late in the afternoon with the news that everything had gone smoothly. As of Monday afternoon, she was no longer married to Dan. All the paperwork had been signed, sealed and notarized. She was a single woman again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanksgiving morning, Grace woke early. Just as she had a year ago. But last Thanksgiving she’d bought a twenty-pound turkey. While she stuffed the bird and prepared it for roasting, Dan had bantered with her and then gone outside to cut firewood. Later, Kelly and Paul had come to dinner and Maryellen did, too. It had been a pleasant day, a family day, full of laughter and warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, Kelly and Paul were driving to his parents’ home, Dan was gone and the twenty-pound turkey had been replaced by a small turkey breast and a store-bought pumpkin pie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace found it impossible to contain her emotions. The house had never felt so big and empty. Sensing her mood, Buttercup stayed close to Grace as she wandered aimlessly from room to room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after she’d filed for divorce, Grace had cleaned out Dan’s side of the closet. Although she’d searched his clothes before, desperate for some hint as to why her husband had disappeared and where, she’d gone through each shirt and pants pocket a second and even a third time. Then she’d folded up his clothes and set them aside to donate to charity. They were neatly piled in bags and boxes, which she’d left in one of the empty bedrooms for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and glancing at her watch, Grace saw that it was barely seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” she said, wondering who would phone this early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of static answered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” she said again, more loudly this time. An uneasy feeling came over her when the line was suddenly disconnected. She hung up but kept her hand on the phone for a few seconds. How…strange. This was just the kind of stunt Dan would pull. Dear God in heaven, could it have been him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he, too, thinking about their Thanksgiving just a year ago? Perhaps he missed her; perhaps he’d read about the divorce in the paper’s legal announcements. Dear God, this was craziness! Sheer absurdity. She had to let go of Dan, she had to stop thinking about him. Her marriage was over, and she had to move on to the next stage of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen got to the house around noon. By then, Grace had the potatoes on to boil and the turkey breast was baking, browning nicely. She planned to mash the potatoes with garlic and serve broccoli and a small salad. “It smells good in here,” her daughter said as she let herself in the kitchen door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set a small pot of bronze chrysanthemums in the middle of the table and kissed Grace on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I made that orange-cranberry relish you like so much,” Grace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Mom, that’s great. It just wouldn’t seem like Thanksgiving without your relish.” She opened the refrigerator and peeked inside. “My goodness, how much did you make?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just what the recipe calls for.” Maryellen’s question was yet another reminder that it was only the two of them this year. “Take whatever you want home with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Maryellen moved restlessly around the kitchen. “Do you need me to do anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything’s pretty much under control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter walked down the hallway to what had once been her bedroom. She returned a couple of minutes later. “I see you’ve got Dad’s stuff packed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears clogged Grace’s throat. She nodded. “The divorce was final on Monday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Maryellen gently squeezed her arm. “How are you handling this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About the same as you did when your divorce came through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen sighed deeply. “That bad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace looked away, determined not to allow this day of giving thanks to become a day of grief and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang and Grace motioned for Maryellen to answer, fearing that if she spoke now, her voice would crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” Maryellen said, then frowned. “Hello? Hello?” After a moment, she hung up the receiver. “That was weird. There was no one at the other end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got a call like that earlier,” Grace said. “No one answered then, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen stared at her with stricken eyes. “Do you…think it was Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had already guessed exactly that, but she had no way of knowing for sure. Cutting back on expenses had been important, and soon after Dan’s disappearance, she’d cancelled Caller ID and the other extras the phone company offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would he do such a thing?” Maryellen demanded, sounding angry now. “Why can’t he just stay out of our lives instead of playing these sick games?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose he misses us,” Grace said. It was the only reason she could think of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he misses us so much, why doesn’t he come home?” Maryellen shouted. “I’m going to tell him that.” She reached for the phone and started punching in numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you calling?” Grace asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Star 69.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t work,” Grace said, her voice tight. “I couldn’t afford all those extras…. Dan must’ve known that. He must’ve figured out that I wouldn’t be able to trace the call.” She closed her eyes in a futile effort to regain her emotional balance. “Sometimes I think I hate him for doing this to us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, it’s all right. We can’t let him ruin our day….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father and I were married for more than thirty-five years.” Her legs felt shaky and she sank into a kitchen chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t answer it!” Grace said. “Don’t give him the satisfaction. Let it ring, just let it ring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the fifth ring, the answering machine came on, and once more the only sound they heard was static. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/204-rosewood-lane-cedar-cove-2/page-18.html","bookId":1942,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:25 AM"}
