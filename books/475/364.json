The Church had neither human power nor influence to save him. There was no earthly help, but there was help to be obtained by the way of Heaven. They gave themselves to fervent, importunate prayer. God sent His angel, who aroused Peter from sleep and led him out through the first and second wards of the prison; and when they came to the iron gate, it opened to them of its own accord, and Peter was free.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere may be some iron gate in your life that has blocked your way. Like a caged bird you have often beaten against the bars, but instead of helping, you have only had to fall back tired, exhausted and sore at heart. There is a secret for you to learn, and that is believing prayer; and when you come to the iron gate, it will open of its own accord. How much wasted energy and sore disappointment will be saved if you will learn to pray as did the Church in the upper room! Insurmountable difficulties will disappear; adverse circumstances will prove favorable if you learn to pray, not with your own faith but with the faith of God (Mark 11:22, margin). Souls in prison have been waiting for years for the gate to open; love ones out of Christ, bound by Satan, will be set free when you pray till you definitely believe God. ━C. H. P.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEmergencies call for intense prayer. When the man becomes the prayer nothing can resist its touch. Elijah on Carmel, bowed down on the ground, with his face between his knees, that was prayer━the man himself. No words are mentioned. Prayer can be too tense for words. The man\u0027s whole being was in touch with God, and was set with God against the powers of evil. They couldn\u0027t withstand such praying. There\u0027s more of this embodied praying needed. ━The Bent-knee Time\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Groanings which cannot be uttered are often prayers which cannot be refused.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e━C.
