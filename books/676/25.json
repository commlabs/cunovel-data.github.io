And still others were computing on the computer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Nogard looked from one to another. Eenie . . . meenie . . . minie . . .

Unless she found out about that dictionary page I accidentally tore. No, she couldn\u0027t know about that! It happened before she even got here. And I don\u0027t think anybody saw me do it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t do anything,\" she said. I probably should have told Mrs. Jewls about it, she realized, but it wasn\u0027t even my fault!

We all make mistakes. But when you lie about it, you make matters much worse for yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia nodded as she tried to figure out what to do.
