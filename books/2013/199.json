Now, let’s get this invasion under way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A moment,’ Gesler said, settling a scarred hand on Fiddler’s shoulder. ‘She burned the fucking transports, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hard to miss the point of that, wouldn’t you say?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Which meaning are you referring to, Gesler? The one about patrols on this coast seeing the flames or the one about for us there’s no going back?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hood take me, I can only chew on one piece of meat at a time, you know? Start with the first one. If I was this damned empire, I’d be flooding this coastline with soldiers before this day’s sun is down. And no matter how much Mockra our squad mages now know, we’re going to mess up. Sooner or later, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Would that be before or after we start drawing blood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I ain’t even thinking about once we start killing Hood-damned Tiste Edur. I’m thinking about today.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Someone stumbles onto us and we get nasty and dirty, then we bolt according to the plan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And try to stay alive, aye. Great. And what if these Letherii ain’t friendly?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We just keep going, and steal what we need.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We should’ve landed en masse, not just marines. With shields locked and see what they can throw at us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler rubbed at the back of his neck. Then sighed and said, ‘You know what they can throw at us, Gesler. Only the next time, there won’t be Quick Ben dancing in the air and matching them horror for horror. This is a night war we’re looking at. Ambushes. Knives in the dark. Cut and bolt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With no way out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye. So I do wonder if she lit up our transports to tell ‘em we’re here, or to tell us there’s no point in thinking about retreat. Or both.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler grunted. ‘ “Unwitnessed”, she said. Is that where we are? Already?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, Fiddler half rose. ‘Might be, Gesler. Let’s get moving-the birds are twittering almost as loud as we are.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, as they tramped deeper into the wet, rotting forest, Gesler’s last question haunted Fiddler. Is he right, Adjunct? We there already? Invading a damned empire in two-squad units. Running alone, unsupported, living or dying on the shoulders of a single squad mage. What if Bottle gets killed in the first scrap? We’re done for, that’s what. Best keep Corabb nice and close to Bottle, and hope the old rebel’s luck keeps pulling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, the waiting was over. Real ground underfoot-they’d all wobbled like drunks coming up from the strand, which might have been amusing in other circumstances. But not when we could have staggered right into a patrol. Things were feeling solid now, though. Thank Hood. Well, as solid as one could be stumping over moss, overgrown sinkholes and twisted roots. Almost as bad as Black Dog. No, don’t think like that. Look ahead, Fid. Keep looking ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere above them, through a mad witch’s weave of branches, the sky was lightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny more complainin’ from any of you and I’ll cut off my left tit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half-circle of faces ogled her. Good. She was pleased with the way that always worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good thing the swim put you out,’ Bowl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Hellian frowned at the huge soldier. Put out? ‘Heavies are idiots, you know that? Now.’ She looked down and tried counting the number of rum casks she’d managed to drag from the hold before the flames went wild. Six, maybe ten. Nine. She waved at the blurry array. ‘Everybody make room in your packs. For one each.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouchy Brethless said, ‘Sergeant, ain’t we supposed to find Urb and his squad? They gotta be close.’ Then her corporal spoke again, this time in a different voice, ‘He’s right. Bowl, where’d you come from again? Up the shore or down it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t remember. It was dark.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hold on,’ Hellian said, taking a sidestep to maintain her balance on the pitching deck. No, the pitching ground. ‘You’re not in my squad, Bowl. Go away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’d like nothing better,’ he replied, squinting at the wall of trees surrounding them. ‘I ain’t carrying no cask of damned ale. Look at you, Sergeant, you’re scorched all over.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHellian straightened. ‘Now hold on, we’re talking ‘ssential victuals. But I’ll tell you what’s a lot worse. I bet that fire was seen by somebody-and I hope the fool that started it is a heap of ash right now, that’s what I hope. Somebody’s seen it, that’s for sure.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-199.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
