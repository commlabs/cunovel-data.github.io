Published in 1854, it details Thoreau\u0027s sojourn in a cabin near Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau lived at Walden for two years, two months, and two days, but Walden was written so that the stay appears to be a year, with expressed seasonal divisions. Thoreau did not intend to live as a hermit, for he received visitors and returned their visits. Instead, he hoped to isolate himself from society in order to gain a more objective understanding of it. Simplicity and self-reliance were Thoreau\u0027s other goals, and the whole project was inspired by Transcendentalist philosophy. However the house was not in wilderness but at the edge of town, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from his family home, and his mother cooked him meals and cleaned the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/walden.jpg","author":"Henry David Thoreau","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/walden.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:04 PM"}
