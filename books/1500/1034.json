Not only Rochester, even Fitzdurk and Serendela were shocked. The apostles’ consciousness had long become one with Valhalla, so there was no need to see the image inside the central control room. Moreover, that image was originally made for the apostles’ followers, for example, Serendela’s duplicated bodies, these types of people.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe priest in the wind and rain looked just like an ordinary human, even facing the wind and rain a bit strenuous. However, the puppy by his feet was instead extremely lively, it was small and ugly, even when fighting against ordinary people, the most it could do was tug at the trousers. Even so, this type of person made all of the apostles feel a coldness from deep within themselves. That was an instinctive fear, as well as a type of innate hatred. Even though the degree of fear was still less than what was stored within the depths of their memories, it was still extremely similar.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Sixth apostle…:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Creator…:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Where is his biological army?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“The puppy by his feet is precisely it.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Why is there only one?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Because that is an ultra life form…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe three apostles silently communicated, instantly already exchanging a sea of information. When the initial shock passed, Fitzdurk and Serendela both slowly calmed down. Before they met the creator, they were both filled with deep fear, even saying the word creator was a type of taboo. When the creator truly appeared before them, they instead no longer felt that much fear, instead calming down, starting to seriously analyze the creator’s strength and the power difference between them. The two apostles both couldn’t help but recall a maxim from the olden era: only the unknown was true fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe creator stood before them, but his strength was still indistinct like dense fog, difficult for even Serendela to see through him, only able to see a rough outline. However, this made her feel even more at ease, because the creator’s power didn’t possess overwhelming advantage. Even if he maximized all of the unknown negative elements, the apostles still had a chance of winning. Of course, this was on the premise that Madeline took action with full strength. Serendela passed the scouting information to all of the other apostles, including Madeline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eFitzdurk also calmed down, Madeline not showing any reaction. Rochester’s expression was the most complicated. He looked at the creator, slowly saying, “Have you finally awoken as well?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eA copy of Revelation had unknowingly when appeared in the priest’s hands, turning the pages one after another in the rain. There were annotations made all over the pages of the book, this was the crystallization of several decades of meticulous care and wisdom. The priest, while holding Revelation, looked dignified, holy, and humble. When he heard Rochester’s questioning, he lowered his head slightly, saying with a gentle voice, “Not finally, I woke up a long time ago. Thirty years ago, I already opened the sealed memories, knowing my origin and mission. My name, is creator, the sixth apostle, as well as the sword in the unequalled lord’s hand. Only, the sword is not pointed at the lord’s enemies, but rather at the apostles who betrayed the lord.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eRevelation quickly turned page after page, what represented the priest’s past also quickly flipped through. The priest’s voice was gentle and steady, despite the howling winds, torrential rain, lightning and thunder, it still transmitted far in the distance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“No! Do not mention the lord!” Rochester suddenly roared out in alarm, forgetting himself for the first time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhat was unusual was that the priest hesitated for a moment, surprisingly not mentioning the lord again. When his voice stopped, the quickly turning Revelation also stopped. The page opened before the priest was rather clean, lacking annotations. That was the chapter of ‘Judgment Day’, only a single sentence underlined in the entire text.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“The lord is omnipresent.

The lord wasn’t that omnipotent, aloof and remote lord of the olden-era religion, but rather the alternative name of some existence covered in dust deep within their memories. However, perhaps the apostles’ lord and the church’s lord were the same one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eRochester released a long sigh, and then said, “Creator, perhaps the predestination between us has a way of being settled, a way that does not require the annihilation of one side.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“It is the will of this world again…” The priest smiled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“The will of this world isn’t necessarily a bad thing.” Rochester said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe priest surprisingly nodded, agreeing with Rochester’s words. He closed Revelation, speaking with a bit of regret, “Ever since I woke up within your petri dish, I already knew my mission. Destroying you all, is precisely the entire meaning of my existence. At that time, I was reborn again and again within your petri dishes, not because I was captured again and again by you, but rather to observe you better, moreover try to find out where the other apostles were through you. Unfortunately, even though I clearly saw through you, I didn’t obtain any clues regarding the other apostles. That is why after leaving your laboratory, I moved through the wilderness with the identity of a human, trying to find the apostles, and then wipe you all out in one move. Only later did I understand that this was merely an excuse, an excuse that made me temporarily put aside my mission. Meanwhile, excuses, isn’t this a unique characteristic of the will of this world? However, I still feel like the will of this world isn’t bad, at the very least, with its existence, I could temporarily free myself from my instincts and destiny, from this able to look at the world I reside in through a different perspective. It has to be said that the will of the world really is quite wonderful. When you try to look at this world through a different angle, it will almost feel as if you are looking at a completely different world. When the angle is changed again, then it is another new world, this continuing endlessly. It is quite wonderful, don’t you think?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Then, perhaps a battle can be avoided between us…” Rochester asked probingly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“No. You all completely renounced your own missions, while I only temporarily displayed a bit of laziness.
