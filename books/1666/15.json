There was another deck, most likely attached to the loft upstairs. “Your bedroom is the loft?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then the view there has to be much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head to the side. “I also like the view inside my guest bedroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat infused my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin played across his cheeks, almost teasing in nature. “Not that I was watching you. That would be creepy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Yes that would be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eat, Serena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to that again. I set my cup down, but didn’t move toward the bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis commanding attitude sparked a rebellious nature I never knew I had. “Did you make them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “I can cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else can you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s grin spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a lot of things I can do. I’m more than willing to give a detailed breakdown of them, or I’d gladly show you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a sharp breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep, infectious laugh rumbled out of Hunter, and I felt my lips start to spread in response. “Eat,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t talking about those things, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did smile then, only a little, because there was something about his unapologetic nature that was humorous—irritating, but definitely humorous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “I can hear your stomach growling, so it seems pointless that you would fight me on this. And you don’t look like one of those women who starve themselves to have the body of a pubescent girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at him. Should I be offended or not? Hell, I was a woman, so I was going to go with offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re an asshole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, no man—human or other—wants a woman that is straight up and straight down. Men like curves. Men like softness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I had plenty of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to know aliens appreciate hips on a woman,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI muttered, picking up a piece of bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We also like a nice heart-shaped ass, in case you’re wondering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll keep that in mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low, sexy voice, he said, “You do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother change of topic was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t realize I was fighting you on anything. I just don’t like to be bossed around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting his mug down, he folded his hands across his chest…and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, for the love of God,” I griped, shoving the bacon into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a dirty look as I picked up another slice of bacon. Arrogance aside, he made a mean cup of coffee and some damn good bacon. It was sweet with a hint of spice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, things will be easier for you here if you get used to the way it needs to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was going to be a dandy. “And how is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do as I say. It’s that simple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him a moment and then burst into laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. “I didn’t say anything funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, but you did.” I giggled. He couldn’t be serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just because you’re supposed to be protecting me doesn’t give you the power to tell me what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Protecting you has nothing to do with the power I have over you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNibbling on the last of the bacon, I snickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a napkin in sight, I sucked off the leftover grease and salt on my forefinger. “God, arrogant doesn’t even cover what you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It doesn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any warning, Hunter leaned over the table and grasped my wrist. Startled, I let out a little squeak. “And you’re never going to find any words that accurately describe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter pulled my hand toward his mouth, and my eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hunter—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, his lips closed around my finger, sucking the salt and grease right off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tugging motion shot straight through my body like lightning. Another gasp escaped my parted lips as his tongue got involved, tracing upward. A flood of moist heat surged between my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he lifted his head, he was smiling slightly. “I was feeling left out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, but nothing came out. My body ached now, my breasts heavy and full. I watched him let go of my wrist and back away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You taste good,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t have done that,” I said finally, cradling my hand to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” He stood and stretched his arms over his head, back bowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” I sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger rushed through me, partly due to his audacity and my response to him. “I can’t believe you’re asking me why not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explain,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because…because you don’t know me and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to,” he said, as if that was enough of a reason—just because he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “But you can’t do things just because you want to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t?” He laughed then, and it sent a heady shiver down my spine. “I think I just did, and I also know you enjoyed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot to my feet. “How dare—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t even deny it.” He smirked. “I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” My knees felt weak. “Please enlighten me and tell me how you can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can.” He was right in front of me in an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding beside him, his enormous size and strength overwhelming, I wanted to step back, but there was nowhere for me to go. And there was also that part of me that didn’t want to back away, that wanted to see what he was going to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter captured a piece of my hair, untangling it from the rest. Twirling the strand around his finger, he tugged me forward and onto the tips of my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep my balance, I placed my hands out, onto the cool skin of his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin… I never felt anything like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatin stretched over steely muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his head so that his breath danced along my brow. “You are most definitely aroused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark brows rose above the sunglasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could shake my head or take the next breath, his free hand slipped between our bodies and his thumb brushed across the tightened bud. I gasped as the touch shot straight from my breast to my core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter smiled. “I think we both can agree now that you’re aroused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he let go and took a step back. I wobbled to the side, dazed. “That… that was really not proper,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By your standards, not mine, but I was just proving a point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I had thicker clothing. “My standards?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about human standards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just because you’re not human doesn’t mean you don’t have to abide by human standards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. “Is that so? Why won’t you admit you’re aroused?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I’m an Arum and not human?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Was that it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, it weirded me out that he wasn’t human, but honestly, I forgot what he was half of the time. Like when he wasn’t feeding off me it was easy to think he was human. “No. That’s not it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smirk that graced his lips as he strode past me was a work of art. I wanted to smack it off his face, and maybe that was a bitchy thing to think, but he did suck on my fingers, and then some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter said nothing as he disappeared back into the room I was staying in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough tempted to follow him, I remained on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probably expected me to trail after him like a good puppy dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my hands on the railing and closed my eyes, letting the warm breeze wash over my flaming face. I was positive that my stay here was going to turn into something completely insane and out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Hunter had been right, twice now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been aroused—I was still aroused. Several parts of my body were all tingly and warm. I was attracted to him on a base, primal level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the second thing Hunter had been right about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven knowing the truth behind everything, I still really had no idea what kind of shit I’d stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral hours later, I was flipping through a magazine I’d found, but my eyes kept straying to the study doors. Tossing the magazine onto the coffee table, I looked around the living room and exhaled loudly. I swung my legs off the couch and started toward the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart stopping, I placed a hand to my chest as I spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus! Where did you come from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kitchen,” Hunter said, swaggering into the room. He stopped at the arm of the couch, the old tee shirt stretching across his broad shoulders as he swirled a spoon along the inner edges of a bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were you doing, Serena?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason I felt like I’d been caught doing something bad and that ticked me off. “I was looking for you, actually. I thought you were in the study.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne dark brow arched. “I was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the closed door and then raised my brows questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter grinned. “Doors don’t really apply to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. “So you can just squeeze through cracks or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin didn’t fade. “Or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing out a frustrated breath, I watched him finish off whatever he was eating and place the bowl on the coffee table. “Can I ask you something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Depends on the question,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really hadn’t expected a different answer. “How can you go from human form to something that’s not even solid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the edge of the couch, stretching his long legs out. Moments passed and, just when I figured he wasn’t going to do anything other than stare at me, he finally answered. “We’re able to break down molecules and spread them apart. We’re still in a solid form, but to the human eye it doesn’t appear that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, I sat on the couch. “So it’s an optical illusion then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about how he’d worn sunglasses outside earlier. “Does light bother your eyes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it’s bright, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like being in the dark more than you do the light?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested his hands on his knees. “Actually, I prefer the light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that strange…for your kind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We prefer light and warmth. Both things are not inherent to us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI digested that the best I could. “Is that why your skin is cool most of the time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments passed, and then Hunter tipped his head back and closed his eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-15.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
