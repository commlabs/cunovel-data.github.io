Where are you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found my parents sitting in the family room. My mom was finishing a scrapbook and my dad was channel surfing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need your help I continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already gave you your allowance, my mother said, gluing a border on a photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dont need money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm not signing a note asking for you to be dismissed early because you want to watch Dark Shadows. I told you to DVR it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom. This is way important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you suspended? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpelled?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrested?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms in disgust. Are you finished?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm all ears, my mom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander needs some new furniture for the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmI suppose you want something Victorian? You never know what you might find at a yard sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe dont have time to wait for the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about Annies Antiques?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, were doing a makeover. We need to make the Mansion look like our home. Or the neighbors. Or the Mitchells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad came out of his TV coma. Whats going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven needs some tips on making the Mansion appear morenormal. She wants it to look more like our home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father was confused. Our home? But we dont have bats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr spiderwebs, my mom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr creaking floors, my dad added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do have those upstairs, my mom corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you through? I asked, disgusted with my parents teasing. This has to be done immediately. Where are all your catalogs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy all of a sudden do you want to do this makeover? my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander is going to have an interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow exciting, she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasnt as thrilled. Once the reporter sees what the Mansion looks like, Alexander will be the laughingstock of this town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hardly think that will happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou just did it yourself. You both were making fun of it. How will he feelwith some reporters comments published throughout town?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once I had silenced my parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee our problem? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour father and I were just kidding. Youre rightwe really shouldnt have said those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the townthey wont be fooling around. Theyll mean it. You see how Ive been treated for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThats what I dont understand, my dad said. I thought you were all about being yourselfno matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I figured Alexander would be, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he is, I said emphatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no reason, then, my mom said, that Alexander should change who he isor where he lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo where is our nonconforming daughter? my dad asked. What has happened to you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe dont want the whole town to know my boyfriends a vampire. That he sleeps in a coffin and has a cellar filled with bottles of blood, okay? I wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on trial in front of my parents. They waited for the accused to speakto declare if I was guilty of trading in my own belief system. I was asking them to understand why I was changing my whole character in order to impress the very town from which Id been an outcast my entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were correct. Under normal circumstances, Id never go along with Alexander trying to change who he was. But if the town knew he was a vampire, hed be the one in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Alexander doesnt want the town to see his real image, I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts an invasion of his space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you figure that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mansion is his studio, his home, his family. Hes already shared his soul in his paintingsdoes he have to share it in a newspaper, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents agreed. I was beginning to get through to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, its not my decision, I said. Its Alexanders. And he wants the Mansion to appear like any other home in Dullsville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mothers bewilderment turned to joy. Then I guess Im forced to help you shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson and I are going to pick up the furniture after school. I just dont know where to begin, and I thought youd be great in giving me some ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome into my private stash. I followed my mom into her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a man might have stashed Playboys, my mom had hidden her Pottery Barns. She reached underneath her bed and pulled out a large plastic container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have every issue from every home store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hunkered down on her bed like two girls at a sleepover. We spread out the catalogs and pored over the slick pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRugs are a great accent. Framed pictures can make a statement. Clocks can really be striking. She noted pages with Post-its, and with a thick black marker I circled items that reminded me of Trevors home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping for a day like this since you were a little girl, she said, for decorating your roombut Ill settle for decorating Alexanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson and I were armed with catalogs and a credit card. We had to go to the one place Id never imagined the Creepy Man would ever escort me tothe mall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an understatement to say that we were an odd pair. Elderly mall walkers, tweens with cell phones and Vera Bradley backpacks, kissing couples, and families filled the food court. There was only one bald butler and morbidly dressed girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered a home store Id only been in when I was being dragged by my mother and the mall benches were already occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were immediately confronted by a friendly woman with a rock star headset. Do you need help? she asked sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could say that, I said. Wed like to purchase a few things for the home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer forehead wrinkled as she tried to assess the couple who stood before her. Uncle and niece? Father and daughter? Boyfriend and young girlfriend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the expression on her face, I think she settled for Creepy Man and Monster Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts not for my home, I reassured her. Its for his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, then. The saleswoman did her best to hide her discomfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss? Jameson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Lauren, he began in a soft and velvety Romanian accent, I am so delighted that you will be helping us. I can tell you have impeccable taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren was immediately captured by the Creepy Mans compliment. Thank you, she gushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, Miss Lauren, we need to have these delivered quickly, Jameson told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf its in stock, we can have it delivered the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen lead me to those items, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren guided us around the store like a docent in a fine arts museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe picked out a few rugs, a desk and hutch, and furniture covers. She showed us a dozen lamps and pushed one long hanging rug after another until Jameson found one he liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a blast shopping with the Creepy Man. My mom usually took ages to decide between two varieties of the same item, then, after deciding on the most perfect one, went to another store, only to finally come back to the original and buy it, while Jameson instantaneously picked out furniture, rugs, and accessories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren rang up our purchases and Jameson handed over his credit card and signed his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the store with oversized shopping bags like any other normal Dullsvillian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow all we needed was a cleaning company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander wouldnt let me inside until the Mansions makeover was complete. I heard bustling and tried to peek into the window, but the dirt blocked my view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was seated on the stoop when I received a text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey Hottie, What are you doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sender was from an unavailable number. I dismissed the call, and as I waited on the stoop, the Mansions door finally creaked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander stood as Id never seen him before. He was wearing pressed jeans and an oxford shirt, a brown leather belt and shiny loafers. He was unbearably handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is Alexander? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? he asked, nervous about my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are gorgeous! Id never imagined you as an insider, I said, checking him out. You look like you belong in a prep school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood, thats the look were going for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mansion had been transformed into a spread from Homes \u0026amp; Gardens. Everything seemed completely wrong. With the new slipcovers, the couches appeared brand new and the room clean, sweet-smelling, and free of any unwanted eight-legged insects. Hurricane lamps and framed flowers lined the mantel. Bright yellow and white pillows popped out against white linen-covered chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks like someone else lives here, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think so? Sebastian asked, pleased with the results. Alexander will be like any other person living in townonly hell have a butler instead of a few parents. That will accentuate his trust-fund status, he said, thinking out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouve covered all your bases, I said, noticing that a floor-length candelabra had been replaced with a silver floor lamp. Giles Lunken wont have anything to say, except Hes one of our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, Sebastian began, it gets better. Now theres no need for a photographer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Sebastian into a roomformerly the parlor, now a studio with desk, computer, and easel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts almost finished. I just have to print it out, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian went to the printer tray and handed me a glossy photo. I held it in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a picture of Alexander!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be his artists headshot, Sebastian boasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was amazed. For the first time in my life, I held a picture of my vampire boyfriend. I love it! It looks exactly like you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used one of my image-enhancement software programs, Sebastian proudly said, and played around with some photographs I found online. I used Johnny Depp and made a few tweaks to bone structure and added pale skin, and voil��! Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks like a real photograph. And it looks like you! Can I keep it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to give it to Mr. Lunken for the article. But I can print you another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrint a hundred! I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so distracted by finally possessing a photograph of Alexander, I almost forgot that the preppy guy standing in front of me was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boyfriend tugged at the collar of his shirt and fiddled with his shoes. I watched him as he uncomfortably tried to adapt to his new image. He was trying his best to fool even himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe returned to the living room, where he put a log in the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou hate it, dont you, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis house is beautifuldont get me wrong, he lamented. And the clothes look great on a guy in a magazine. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dont want to let you down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe? I said. Ive spent my whole life not conforming. Why would I judge you if you dont feel comfortable in an image that isnt your own?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause if I dont do itif that reporter snoops around or it slips out that I sleep in a coffinthat I drink blood for breakfast Alexanders voice rose. It is dangerous not only for me, but for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand. I, too, was afraid Mr. Lunken would find out and reveal Alexanders true identity. But mostly for Alexanders sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm not sure you do. Is this the life you really want, Raven? The one youve desired all your life? Or is it just about the fantasy of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean? I asked. Being a vampire had always fascinated me. I knew there were drawbacks, but werent there drawbacks to being mortal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are all about showing the world who you truly are. What if you couldnt anymore? he asked sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something I hadnt thought about. Id imagined a life of darkness and mystery, but not one where Id have to hide who I was. I dont know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about it. Me, Sebastian, Jagger, even Luna. Were all in a club that no mortal wants to joinexcept for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you even told your own mother about me? Or Becky?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course not. I thought you didnt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. I dont. He wandered back to the mantel, stoked the fire, and gazed into the crackling flames shooting from the burning logs. But sometimes I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was speechless. Alexander was so much more complicated than I could ever imagine. I did feel sorry for him. I never hid from others my thoughts and tastes, no matter how outlandish, and yet he had to keep secret everything about his lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I want your parents to know, he continued. Just be able to be who I am. And not have them be fearful of me. Not have them run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldnt imagine my parents running from Alexander under any circumstances. Maybe this was my opportunity to let them into his world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you want me to tell them? I moved toward him and drew him in to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be the end of everythingof our relationship, of my living here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it isnt? I asked excitedly. What if they embrace it? Then neither one of us would have to hide it anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think your father wants you dating a vampire? A guy who drinks blood to exist?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheyre former hippies. They might think they were having a flashback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm serious. They arent hippies anymore. They are parents of a teenage girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down on the sofa. Its been great having Sebastian here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you. Its been a long time since Ive been able to be myself, apart from being with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quite the sightAlexander, my once gothic prince, transformed into a handsome quarterback from a boarding school, living in a palatial mansion, pained with loneliness even as I sat right next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my life, Raven, whether I have to hide out in a Mansion, live among my kind, or hide out in the Dungeon at the Coffin Club. Its all about secrecy and survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eId never been about hiding or not getting in peoples faces. Maybe I couldnt be a vampire after all. Could I take the solitude? Or wandering around like Sebastian, trying to find those who were like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Alexander was pushing me awaynot from him, but from the fantasy of being a vampire. So if I was to truly be with him, Id have to show him how much I cared for him and push back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wed live together, I said. Like your parents do. I just want to be with youand I just want everyone to love you for who you are, just like I do. But I understandAlexander, I know Im impulsive, but I want whats best for youno matter what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to me, his eyes soulful and his shiny hair glistening. A gorgeous smile emerged from his serious face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fixed his collar so it rested flatly. Besides, it is only temporary. But dont be mad at me if I slip and call you Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander didnt find my joke amusing, and he rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didnt mean to I started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didnt speak but shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm sorry.
