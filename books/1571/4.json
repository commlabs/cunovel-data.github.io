He looked up at Sil-Chan out of the corners of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mundial native hitched himself forward and leaned an elbow on the desk. \"There\u0027s a new government, Vince, and they\u0027re planning to destroy the Library. And that gourd-head Patterson has been giving in to every order they send. Do this! Do that! He does it! He told us flat out he wouldn\u0027t defy a government order.\" Sil-Chan\u0027s mouth set in a thin line. \"It\u0027s against the Library Code!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is we?\" asked Coogan. \"Huh?\" Sil-Chan looked blank. \"The we you said hasn\u0027t decided whether to exterminate Pchak,\" said Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Sil-Chan leaned back. \"Only about a third of the home staff. Most of the collection crews are joining us fast as they come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan tapped a finger against the desk. Some eight thousand people, more or less, he thought. He said, \"What\u0027s your plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy.\" Sil-Chan shrugged. \"I\u0027ve about fifty men in Section \u0027C\u0027 on the sixty-ninth level waiting for the word to move against Pchak and his bodyguards. Another three hundred are topside ready to jump the government ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan tipped his head to one side and stared at Sil-Chan in amazement. \"Is that your ultimatum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan shook his head. \"No. Where\u0027s Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething decisive meshed in Coogan\u0027s mind. He got to his feet. \"Patterson\u0027s dead. I\u0027m director. What\u0027s your ultimatum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment\u0027s silence with Sil-Chan looking up at Coogan. \"How\u0027d he die?\" asked Sil-Chan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was old,\" said Coogan. \"What\u0027s your ultimatum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan wet his lips with his tongue. \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that, Vince.\" Again he shrugged. \"But this makes our job simpler. You\u0027re a man who\u0027ll listen to reason.\" He met Coogan\u0027s stare. \"This is our plan. We take over this Pchak and his ship, hold him as hostage while we convert every broadcast channel we have to public support. With five thousand channels telling the --\" \"You bone-brain!\" barked Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s as stupid a plan as I\u0027ve ever heard. Adams would ignore your hostage and drop a stellar bomb in our laps!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Vince --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t but, Vince, me,\" said Coogan. He came around the desk and stood over Sil-Chan. \"As long as you\u0027re running around disobeying the orders of your superiors you\u0027ll refer to me as Mr. Director and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan charged to his feet, glared up at Coogan. \"I hate to do this, Vince,\" he said, \"but we have organization and purpose. You can\u0027t stop us! You\u0027re relieved of your directorship until such time as --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Coogan strode around behind his desk, put his hand on a short lever low on the control panel. \"Do you know what this is, Toris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan\u0027s face showed uncertainty. He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the master control for the gravitronic unit,\" said Coogan. \"If I push it down, it shuts off the unit. Every bit of soil, everything beyond the Library shell will drift off into space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pasty color came over Sil-Chan\u0027s features. He put out a hand toward Coogan. \"You can\u0027t do that,\" he said. \"Your wife and family -- all of our families are up there. They wouldn\u0027t have a chance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m director here,\" said Coogan. \"The position is my earned right!\" With his free hand, he moved four switches on the control wall. \"That seals off your sixty-ninth level group behind fire panels.\" He turned back to Sil-Chan. \"Now, get in touch with every insurgent under you and have them turn in their arms to robots which I\u0027ll release for the job. I know who some of your men are. They\u0027d better be among the ones you contact. If you make one move I don\u0027t like, this lever goes down and stays down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" said Sil-Chan. He ground his teeth together. \"I knew I should\u0027ve carried a blaster when I came in here. But no! You and Patterson were the civilized types! We could reason with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start making those calls,\" said Coogan. He pushed his desk visor toward the other man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan jerked the visor to him, obeyed. Coogan gave his orders to robot dispatching headquarters, waited for Sil-Chan to finish. The Mundial native finally pushed the visor back across the desk. \"Does that satisfy you?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Coogan steepled his hands in front of him. \"I\u0027m arming some of the staff I can trust. Their orders will be to shoot to kill if there\u0027s a further act of insurrection.\" He leaned forward. \"In addition, we\u0027re going to have guard stations between sectors and a regular search procedure. You\u0027re not getting another chance to cause trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan clenched and unclenched his fists. \"And what do you intend to do about this Pchak and his Leader Adams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re the government,\" said Coogan. \"As such the Code requires that we obey their orders. I will obey their orders. And, any man on the staff who even hints at disobedience, I\u0027ll personally turn over to Pchak for disciplinary action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan arose slowly. \"I\u0027ve known you more than sixty years, Mr. Coogan. That just shows how little you can learn about a rat. After you\u0027ve lost the Library to this madman, you won\u0027t have a friend left here. Not me, not the people who trust you now. Not your wife or your family.\" He sneered. \"Why -- one of your own sons, Phil, is in with us.\" He pointed a finger at Coogan. \"I intend to tell everyone about the threat you used today to gain control of the Library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Control of the Library is my earned right,\" said Coogan. He smiled, pushed down the lever in the control wall. The wall made a quarter turn on a central pivot. \"Toris, send up a repair robot when you report back to Pchak. I\u0027ve special installations I want to make here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan came to the edge of the desk, staring down at the lever which had controlled the movement of the wall. \"Tricked me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tricked yourself,\" said Coogan. \"You did it the moment you turned your back on our greatest strength -- obedience to the government.\" Sil-Chan grunted, whirled and left the office. Coogan watched the door as it closed behind the other man, thought, If I only had as much faith in those words as I\u0027m supposed to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a pretty woman with hair like glowing coals, small features except for a wide, sensual mouth. Her green eyes seemed to give off sparks to match her hair as she stared out of the visor at Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vince, where have you been?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke in a tired voice. \"I\u0027m sorry, Fay. I had work that had to be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"The boys brought their families from Antigua for a reunion and we\u0027ve been ready for you for hours. What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s this nonsense Toris is bleating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan sighed and brushed a hand through his hair. \"I don\u0027t know what Toris is saying. But the Library is in a crisis. Patterson is dead and I\u0027ve nobody I can trust to hold things together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes went wide; she put a hand to her mouth, spoke through her fingers. \"Oh, no! Not Pat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it was too much for him,\" said Coogan. \"He was old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t believe Toris,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan felt a great weariness just at the edge of his mind. \"You said the boys are there,\" he said. \"Ask Phil if he was part of the group backing Toris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell you myself he was,\" she said. \"It\u0027s no secret. Darling, what\u0027s come over you? Toris said you threatened to dump the whole surface off into space.\" \"It was an empty threat then,\" said Coogan. \"Toris was going to disobey the government. I couldn\u0027t permit it. That would only --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Vince! Have you gone out of your mind?\" Her eyes registered amazement and horror. \"This Adams means to destroy the Library! We can\u0027t just sit back and let him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve grown lax in our training.\" said Coogan. \"We\u0027ve had it too easy for too long. That\u0027s a situation I intend to correct!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m permitted to handle things my way, he won\u0027t destroy the Library,\" said Coogan. \"I was hoping you\u0027d trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I trust you, darling, but --\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/direct-descent/page-4.html","bookId":1571,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM"}
