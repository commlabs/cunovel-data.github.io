That you\u0027re dumping Chloe for her? Remember that, you humongous idiot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" I say, holding up my hands, both of which she smacks at. \"You\u0027re really coked up and you need a tranquilizer and you need to get your facts straight-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying this didn\u0027t happen, Victor?\" she shouts, grabbing at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding her back, I look intently into her face and offer, \"I\u0027m not saying it didn\u0027t happen, Alison.\" I breathe in. \"I\u0027m just saying that I wasn\u0027t conscious when this occurred and I guess I\u0027m saying that you weren\u0027t conscious either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you telling me we didn\u0027t have this conversation?\" she screams. \"Are you telling me I hallucinated it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her. \"Well, in a nutshell, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone starts knocking on the bathroom door, which provokes Alison into some kind of massive freak-out. I grab her by the shoulders and turn her around to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I was doing my MTV \u0027House of Style\u0027 interview\"-I check the watch I\u0027m not wearing-\"ninety minutes ago, so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, it was you!\" she shouts, pushing me away from her. \"You were standing there outside my place telling me that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wasted!\" I cry out. \"I\u0027m leaving and yeah, baby-it is all over.

A whole group of people squeeze past me and though they probably despise Alison they decide to surround her and take notes while she sobs, her face a wreck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not a player,\" is the last thing Alison ever screams at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll slide down the surface of things ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren stands with Jason London and Elle Macpherson exchanging recipe tips for smart drinks even though someone shockingly famous\u0027s penis exploded when his smart drink was mixed with \"the wrong elements\" and everyone goes \"oooh\" but Lauren\u0027s not really listening because she\u0027s watching Damien schmoozing a group that includes Demi Moore, Veronica Webb and Paulina Porizkova, and when Elle kisses me on the cheek and compliments my stubble Lauren abruptly looks away from Damien and just stares at me blankly-a replicant-and I wipe my nose and move toward her, suddenly in a very huggy mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard?\" she asks, lighting a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I\u0027m in dire need of a crisis-management team?
