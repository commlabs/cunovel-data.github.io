Clear Skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day started like any other day, the air clear and dry. Travelers streamed to and fro along the main road leading out of Jinan City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for some people, although the day started like any other day, the end of the day would be completely different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way to put it would be to say that some people might look ordinary on the outside, but are actually anything but.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao was one such person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao, an ordinary person, a businessman, appeared to be quite honest, yet wasn’t the slightest bit stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither fat nor skinny, neither handsome nor ugly, he wore a set of clothing which, though not crafted from the finest material, appeared to be very durable. Covered with dust from time spent traveling, he rode a mule that seemed to be as hard working as himself. Not young, he looked like the kind of person who had some savings somewhere. He just wanted to provide for his wife and children, and maybe make his own life a bit more comfortable when he grew old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knows how many people like this exist in the world. The only difference between him and them is that before sunset on April 15th, no one had ever seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had ever seen him before, not even a single person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could even say—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ordinary businessman Wu Tao didn’t appear in the world until after the death of the multi-millionaire Sun Jicheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn’t appeared at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of big cities are small towns, and small towns always have inns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Village outside of Jinan City had inns, and that was where Wu Tao was staying. [1] He’d arrived late in the night on April 15th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, the moon had already began to set, and the inn’s main gate had been closed. He’d called out for quite some time before they opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chose an inn in this village because at that hour, the city gates of Jinan Prefecture were all closed. As a traveler from another part of China, no matter how much you called out, they wouldn’t be opened. So he had no choice but to stay at an inn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—But was he really traveling from another part of China to Jinan Prefecture? Or was he actually leaving Jinan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the innkeeper and staff had no interest in asking such questions, neither did they notice whether his appearance on the second day was the same as his appearance upon his arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk who had woken up in the middle of the night to receive him hadn’t paid the slightest attention to what he looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, no one paid any attention at all to what he did in his room that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 16th was market day in Liu Village; early in the morning people flocked from everywhere to participate, bringing along their chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, fruit, vegetables, seafood, flowers, rice, flour, and grain to barter for makeup materials, silk cloth, embroidery or pieces of silver to take back to their happy families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, pickpockets and beggars wouldn’t miss this chance to take advantage of all the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the inn opened its main gate, the square and main street across from it was packed with people of all sorts. There were even two Jianghu theatrical troupes performing, so the village bustled even more than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao couldn’t help but go out to soak in the excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he noticed something quite amazing. It seemed the beggars here were extremely organized; the quietly collected their gains into a specific area. If people didn’t give them anything, they didn’t ask for anything. If people gave a lot, they likewise did not call out, not even to say “thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn every group, an older beggar with a burlap sack on his back sat in the rear, dividing up their spoils evenly amongst the other members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would have imagined that beggars would have such systemized rules. Everyone found it quite interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one of the beggars, a fellow with rather large eyes, didn’t seem to understand the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis young man had a round face, and when he smiled, two dimples appeared. Whenever he caught someone’s attention he would smile and stretch out his hands. Perhaps because of his charming appearance, or perhaps because of his ability to judge people’s characters, when he stretched out his hands, they rarely came back empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he collected more and more money, all of which went into his own bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his bag filled up, he began wandering amidst the crowd, and at one point he smacked into Wu Tao and sent him tumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao didn’t give him a single copper coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t the type to give out charity. His money had been painstakingly earned, much more painstakingly than any money this beggar ever earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that the young beggar had bumped into him on purpose. But he was more slippery than a \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/lfbt9o9\"\u003eloach\u003c/a\u003e [2], and immediately after hitting Wu Tao, he ran off, disappearing without a trace in a matter of seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao didn’t pursue him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also wasn’t the type of person to look for trouble or get angry about trifles. And yet, after getting smacked into, his excitement regarding the market disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the inn, mounted his mule, and headed straight for Jinan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really did head straight for Jinan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of where he came from, this was a fact, and no lie. By noon, he had already arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongs and drums clanged and clashed in the marketplace. A young girl, seventeen or eighteen years old, her hair combed into two braids, was performing a tumbling act. Her legs, long, straight, and strong, seemed to be ready at any moment to burst out of the trousers she wore, which were sewn together from multiple pieces of colorful cotton cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis area of the market was much more lively than others, with many people gathering to watch the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar slipped like a loach through the crowd, then squatted down, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that the stingy old man with the gray, pointed face wouldn’t pursue him. He probably still didn’t realize that his coin purse was no longer at his waist, but in the young beggar’s knapsack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis coin purse was not light at all; there must be at least twenty or thirty shiny pieces of silver inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar, his large eyes drawn to the long legs of the girl with the braids, felt quite happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she held out her copper gong and said, “Dear audience, please give a few coins,” the young beggar, who just now been begging others for alms, suddenly became generous. He pulled out a few coins and tossed them into the gong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe braided girl smiled at him sweetly, and the beggar suddenly felt a bit dizzy. Just when he was thinking of giving a few more coins, he suddenly felt hands clamp down on his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two beggars, one pock-marked, the other crippled, and the force of their grip was not light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar might be as slippery as a loach, but in their grip he could barely move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he could do was smile at them with his trademark specialty smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, these two fellow beggars did not seem to be the least bit moved by his round face, big eyes and dimples. Not only did they refuse to release him, the grabbed his arms and dragged him up from the ground and away from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone around was paying attention to the long legs, and not a one seemed to care about the affairs of these three stinking beggars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gongs and drums sounded out again, and a new show started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar was not small. Looking at his face you might put him at between 14-16, although judging on his physique he was probably between 17-19. But in the hands of the pockmarked and crippled beggars, he was like a baby chick, his two feet not even touching the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to laugh, but couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also wanted to cry out, but the pockmarked beggar had already scooped up a handful of mud from the ground. “If you cry out, I’ll stuff your mouth full of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting your mouth filled up with a big handful of mud was no fun, so the young beggar could only make a bitter face and say, “Dear sirs, I didn’t do anything to offend you. My are you treating a poor kid like me in this way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn’t want to have to deal with you,” said the crippled one. Though his face was stiff, his voice was mild. “But you need to come somewhere with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go somewhere? Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To see Uncle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle? Ever since I was young, I never had a mom or dad, where could an Uncle come from?” The young beggar seemed on the verge of tears. “Sirs, I think you must have made some kind of mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ignored him. The sound of drums and gongs from the marketplace grew more and more distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had already reached a small hill outside the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the hillside stood a large, bluish-green tree. Underneath the tree lay a bluish green slab of stone. And on the stone sat a man wearing a bluish green garment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garment, dilapidated, covered with patches, was nonetheless quite clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s face too, was clean, but expressionless, seemingly without any color whatsoever, almost as if he were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully it was the middle of the day; were it the middle of the night, anyone who saw him would either be scared to death or scared so bad they would jump three meters into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if the man in bluish-green hadn’t noticed them. He just sat there, his head tilted at an angle, staring off into the distance, seemingly lost in thought. Perhaps he was recalling some bittersweet memory, or perhaps some unforgettable person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet his ashen face showed no expression, and his cold eyes truly looked like a corpse’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pockmarked beggar and the crippled beggar stood in front of him, not daring to even breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar seemed to have lost his usual nerve, and was too scared to say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite some time passed before the man in bluish-green garment spoke. And when he did, he only said three words: “Let him go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two beggars immediately released their pincer-like grasp on the young beggar. Even as he let out a sigh of relief, he took a closer look and suddenly noticed that the right sleeve of the man’s bluish-green garment was empty. Completely empty and tucked into the waist of his garment. On his back he carried several large burlap sacks, all empty. It looked like there were at least five, and maybe even seven or eight. [3]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother burlap sack lay on the bluish-green rock, and it seemed to be bulging with something, although who knew what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone with experience in Jianghu should be able to tell that the man with the bluish-green garment and missing arm was someone of immense power and influence, with countless disciples under his control. He was clearly one of the esteemed and venerated Elders of the great “Beggar Sect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the young beggar didn’t seem to realize this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t understand rules, and didn’t understand the ways of the world. And what’s worse, things that he shouldn’t understand, he seemed to know a lot about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than stealing chickens and petting dogs, showing his dimples and feigning cuteness and innocence, and making off with other’s money, he also seemed to understand how to appreciate women’s legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one-armed man continued to stare off into the distance for a while before suddenly saying, “Do you know who I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar shook his head vigorously. And then, he suddenly started nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know who you are,” he said. “These two sirs said they were going to take me to see Uncle. You must be him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man didn’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar sighed. “Unfortunately, you aren’t my Uncle. I don’t even have an uncle. So whose Uncle are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly clapped his hands. “I know. You aren’t anyone’s Uncle. People just call you that. It’s your nickname.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man didn’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar laughed, pleased to find himself so intelligent. Even a difficult question like this one was no problem for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the next question wasn’t so easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know why I had them bring you to see me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” When unable to answer a question, the best thing to do is to ask a followup question, a trick often used by worldly-wise people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it turns out this little bastard knew the trick too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt long last, the man in bluish-green turned his head, staring at the young beggar with cold eyes. In an icy voice he said ten words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s because you violated the rules of the our Sect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sect?” The young beggar didn’t seem to understand. “What Sect are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Poor Family Sect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in Jianghu knows that the Poor Family Sect is none other than the Beggar Sect. But it seemed the young beggar didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You made a mistake. I’m not in the Poor Family Sect. I mean, I’m poor, but I don’t have a family. If I did, then maybe I wouldn’t be poor!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter if you aren’t a member of our Sect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because our Sect governs everyone in the world who makes their living by begging.” His voice, though cold and detached, carried the feeling of frightening power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar laughed again, a laugh of pure happiness. And then he said two words that no one could possibly have imagined he would say: “Good bye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually people only say good bye when the time has come to leave — sometimes when they truly must leave, or other times when they don’t at all want to. Sometimes it’s just for show, a way to cajole others in to urging you to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the young beggar really did mean to leave. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he made to depart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, he couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could move a meter, the two beggars with their pincer-like grasps grabbed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you grabbing me for?” protested the young beggar. “There’s nothing here to do with me. I’m not in your Poor Family Sect, and I’m not a beggar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’m not. I recently changed professions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Changed professions to what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a thief.” The young beggar spoke with utmost confidence: “Even if you’re the ancestor of all the young beggars in the world, you aren’t in charge of me, because I’m a thief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he said did make sense. Nobody could say it didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armless man in the bluish-green garment again stared off into the distance. “Things that other people might not be in charge of,” he said coldly. “I take charge of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—“Because I’m not other people.” “Because I am stronger than other people.” “Because I am more powerful than other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say any of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe neither wanted nor needed to. Sometimes saying nothing is the best thing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the bulging burlap sack which lay next to him on the bluish-green rock. “Take a look,” he said. “Take a look at what’s inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young beggar had wanted to look inside from the very beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that whatever was inside, it wasn’t anything nice, and it wouldn’t do him any good whatsoever to look. But curiosity crawled around inside his heart like a caterpillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he wanted to look. He couldn’t not look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after he did, the crawling caterpillar of curiosity in his heart didn’t leave. Instead, it suddenly turned into a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand caterpillars. Wriggling not just in his heart, but also his stomach, his intestines, his pores, his blood vessels, and even in his bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever caterpillars of curiosity could crawl in his body, they did, until he wanted to kick and curse and cry and vomit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, there wasn’t anything special about the things in the bag. They were things that everyone can see everyday, all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bag was filed with some noses, some ears, and some hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman noses, human ears, and human hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a world of people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as you live in the world, and are not blind, then other than when you are sleeping, you will see these things all the time. It would be hard not to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut things like this should not be packed into a burlap sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in bluish-green, his voice cold, said, “Threaten to blackmail, have ears and nose sliced off.
