The Hound coughed blood in thick, hot sprays, pitched forward, head lolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan kicked it in the throat to free his sword, turned then, and found a mass of Liosan wheeling to face him. No quick way through – both flanks had closed up. Slow work ahead —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, from the wound behind him, a sudden presence that lifted the hairs on the back of his neck. Looming, foul with chaotic sorcery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing under his breath, Yedan Derryg swung round, and plunged into Lightfall’s wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf her warriors had gone down, and Yan Tovis could feel herself weakening. She could barely lift her sword. Gods, what is wrong with me? How badly was I injured? I ache – but … what else? She staggered, sagged down on to one knee. The fighting closed in around her. What —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcussions from beyond the Shake line. The Hound screaming in fury and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead spinning, she looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grey, miasmic wave of sorcery erupted from the edge of the flank closest to Lightfall, the spitting, crackling wave rushing close to strike the press of Liosan. Bodies erupted in red mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouting – someone had hold of Yan Tovis under each arm, was dragging her back to the re-formed Shake line – and there was Skwish, rushing to join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Blood of the queen! Blood of the queen! ’ The witch looked ten years old, a child of shining gold. ‘Get her clear! The rest a you! Advance!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, from the wound, a reverberation that sent them all to their knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeafened by a sudden, thunderous crack! from the breach, Aparal Forge saw his Soletaken kin rearing back. Eldat Pressen, the youngest and boldest of them all, so eager to follow in the wake of the Hounds of Light, was pulling her head back from the wound, and in that recoiling motion blood fountained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared, aghast, as brains and gore sprayed down from her shattered skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body shook in waves of savage trembling, her tail thrashing, claws digging into and then tearing up the ground. A blind sweep of her tail sent broken bodies flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer huge torso collapsing with massive shudders, Eldat’s neck and head writhed, and Aparal could now see the terrible sword blow that had struck her head, splitting the skull open, destroying her and all that she had once been – a bright-eyed, laughing woman. He loosed a sob, but could not turn away. Eldat. Playing in the garden, in another age. We were thinking only of peace then. But now I wonder, did it ever exist? That age? Or were we just holding our breath? Through all those years, those decades – she grew into a beautiful woman, we all saw that. We witnessed and it gave us pleasure .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd oh how we all longed to bed her. But she’d set her heart upon the only one of us who would take no woman – or man – into his arms. Kadagar had no time for such things, and if he broke her heart again and again, well, that was the price of serving his people. As father to them all, he could be lover to none .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKadagar, you stand on the battlements once more .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou look down upon her death, and there is no swift mercy here, no sudden stillness. Her mind is destroyed, but her body refuses to yield. Kadagar Fant, what meaning do you dare take from this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled to regain self-control. ‘Clear the area,’ he said to his officers, his voice breaking. He drew a deep breath, cleared his throat. ‘She will not die quickly. Not now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshen-faced, the soldiers set off to relay the commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal looked back at the gate. Hust. You came to meet her, before she was across the threshold. Where, then, are my soldiers on the other side? Where – gods below – are the Hounds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn cascading streams of light, Yedan Derryg groped blindly. His sword’s laughter was slowly dying away. This was the real danger. Getting lost within Lightfall. But he’d seen little choice, and now he needed to return. One Hound remained. How many of his soldiers were dying even now? Whilst he stumbled blindly in this infernal light?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel the wound’s terrible pain, a vicious, biting thing, desperate to heal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan halted. A wrong step now could take him on to the Liosan plain, facing tens of thousands of the enemy. And more dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy, buffeting currents from behind him. He whirled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething, coming through—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hound exploded from the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped low into a crouch, blade slashing. Cutting through both front legs. The beast stumbled – he twisted and chopped down on its neck. The Hust blade sliced through, leapt out from under its throat with a delighted yelp. The head slammed into the ground at Yedan’s feet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-226.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
