If he left Mu Qingyi or the other Elders here and ran away, nothing would happen to them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Mu Qianyu was different. Mu Qingshu desired Mu Qianyu as well as her Vermillion Bird bloodline, and had been drooling over it for a long time. With Lei Jingtian here, there was nothing that Mu Qianyu could do to resist him. As for Mu Qingshu, he was an extremely depraved individual that was capable of any despicable action imaginable. Lin Ming did not dare to imagine the consequences that would happen if he left Mu Qianyu here and escaped by himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf that happened, then even if he escaped and reached the Revolving Core realm in the future, it would be a tragedy that could never be recovered from even if he tore Mu Qingshu into pieces!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming felt the Escape Symbol in his hand, his mind rapidly raced and his forehead was already wet with sweat. He knew that this Escape Symbol was precious, but he didn’t think that it was precious to the point that even Mu Qianyu wouldn’t have one. Before this, Mu Fengxian must have thought that Mu Qianyu would never be any fatal danger; she never imagined that Mu Chihuo would have ignored the bloodstain contract and rebelled against the sect!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lei Jingtian held the Thunder Light Sword in his hand, a hazy purple electric light spun around the blade, like an ephemeral dream. This unique Disenchanting Dream Light was like thunder and also light; it was elusive and confounding. They didn’t even need Mu Chihuo – just Lei Jingtian was enough to deal with everyone present.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, Lin Ming, I want to see just what tricks you have up your sleeve this time!” Mu Qingshu disdainfully said as he sneered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, he hadn’t started speaking again before the silent Lin Ming suddenly shot out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the blood of the Ancient Phoenix shined with a dazzling red glow between his eyebrows, the Heretical God Force also erupted.

In front of Lin Ming, he simply didn’t have the ability to defend. He did not want to die. He was just about to see Lin Ming die and obtain Mu Qianyu! If he died here, he would have nothing at all!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Humph, how naïve!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLei Jingtian waved his palm, and a normal-looking purple thunder that seemed like electricity and light instantly launched into the crimson vortex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs soon as the attacks struck each other, the crimson vortex violently burst apart. The 15 Blood Drinking Seals were blasted in all directions. Lin Ming coughed and flew backwards, soaring dozens of feet until he smashed into the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe had tried to instantly kill Mu Qingshu to save himself from future troubles, but Lin Ming’s plan had failed. His strength wasn’t at its peak condition. Compared to Lei Jingtian, the strength difference between the two at this moment was just too great!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha! You idiot! You want to hurt me? Dream on!” Mu Qingshu contemptuously laughed. Seeing Lin Ming in this state, his thoughts were smoother and his inner energy felt better; his entire body was incomparably comfortable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming!” Mu Qianyu’s eyes blazed as she rushed towards Lin Ming’s side. “Lin Ming, are you alright!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’m fine.” In fact, Lin Ming hadn’t been wounded. He looked deeply into Mu Qianyu’s eyes and said with a true essence sound transmission, “Wait for me at the entrance to the bloody wilderness…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What?” Mu Qianyu paused. She didn’t know why Lin Ming would suddenly say this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s eyes flashed with determination. He clenched the Escape Symbol in his hand, spoke the incantation, and then pressed it into Mu Qianyu’s hand…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm, this is…” Mu Qianyu felt something cool slip into her hand. Before she could react, a dim light emerged from her palm. Mu Qianyu’s heart suddenly surged with a discomforting restlessness, “Lin Ming, you…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Wait for me there!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e These simple words were firm, confident, and filled with the air of one unafraid of death! As they fell into Mu Qianyu’s ears, every word sunk into her being. In that moment, the sound of countless thunderclaps exploded in Mu Qianyu’s ear, and a deep, agonizing, and inexplicable pain filled her heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs these words echoed in her mind, they began to distort, as if sound itself was being endlessly stretched out… In that moment, Mu Qianyu felt as if she had lost something important. The faint restlessness in her heart became stronger and stronger. Mu Qianyu’s eyes widened as her body was suddenly surrounded by a strange energy. Lin Ming’s features blurred as they faded into an infinite expanse of space, going farther and farther away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu cried out.

What trick is this!?” Mu Qingshu could only watch helplessly as Mu Qianyu was covered by a hazy white light, instantly disappearing. He could not believe this had happened, and he could also not accept that this had happened!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu had been sent off by Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Mu Qianyu disappeared, then how would he give vent to this rage in his heart?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, I will kill you!” Mu Qingshu cried out, his eyes turning mad.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Chihuo’s complexion was also ugly. He was able to recognize that what Lin Ming had just used was Mu Fengxian’s Escape Symbol. “It’s a bit troubling for that girl to escape. Brother Lei, let’s not delay any further and kill Lin Ming. Then we can look for Mu Qianyu. It wouldn’t be good if that girl managed to get a message back to Divine Phoenix Island!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, alright!” Lei Jingtian smiled with indifference. Whether or not news of this matter returned to Divine Phoenix Island, it would not impact him. In truth, all he wanted to do was kill Lin Ming and obtain the ancient devil art techniques in his spatial ring, as well as his Purple Comet Spear and two Thunder Souls!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn addition, what was most important was that Lei Jingtian wanted to know just how Lin Ming had managed to fuse two Thunder Souls into one. If he could also achieve this feat, then it would be of great advantage to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe reason that Lei Jingtian was willing to come and kill Lin Ming was first because of the old hatred between them, and second because Mu Chihuo had promised that as long as he killed Lin Ming, all of the secrets, cultivation method manuals, and other treasures that Lin Ming had would belong to him. Just as long as Mu Chihuo was able to keep Lin Ming’s corpse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This boy is too emotional, he cares about this sort of sentimental love too much. He gave a woman his only chances to escape… what an idiot!” Lei Jingtian laughed. In his opinion, this sort of self-sacrificing action was for the stupid.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qingyi had watched from the side and witnessed the entire process. Lin Ming had given his chance to escape to Mu Qianyu. This action caused her heart to ache with pain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, hurry up and run! We will hold him off!” As Mu Qingyi spoke, a chilling sword light covered her as she slashed her sword at Lei Jingtian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFragmented Ice Cloud!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Humph! You think you are qualified?” Without waiting for Lei Jingtian, Mu Chihuo stepped forwards and shot out his palm. Without even needing his sword, a brilliant inferno of roaring flames suddenly shot out, cracking the ice crystals and then directly pulverizing them!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMeanwhile, Mu Yanzhuo stopped Mu Bingyun, and Lei Jingtian attacked Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sound of rolling thunder filled the air. It mixed with a shining dream-like light, turning into a thick purple beam that pierced towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe beam of light penetrated through the earth, causing rocks to scatter into the air. Lin Ming jumped back, avoiding the frontal attack. However, he was still injured by the shockwaves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs that endless purple light touched Lin Ming’s body, it was like countless steel needles had pierced his spiritual sea.

With Lei Jingtian’s formidable strength, he was able to overcome the suppressive laws of this world to a certain extent and fly. With a speed two or three times faster than Lin Ming’s, he chased after him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damn.” Lin Ming grit his teeth and galvanized Golden Roc Shattering the Void to the limit, shooting forwards like a bolt of lightning. But no matter how amazing Golden Roc Shattering the Void was, Lin Ming’s attainments were limited to a general understanding of the Concept of Wind. He hadn’t even yet crossed into the Concept of Space, so how could his speed compare to the late Revolving Core master Lei Jingtian?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just a few blinks of the eye, Lin Ming was overtaken by Lei Jingtian!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLei Jingtian pressed down his palm at Lin Ming!
