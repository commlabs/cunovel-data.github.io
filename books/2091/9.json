I knew that as well as I knew my bra size. So why were my hands shaking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Place is getting to you,\" I muttered. \"Haunted houses. Werewolves in the swamp. Voodoo priestess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should talk to Cassandra. If anyone would know why I\u0027d seen a dead man walking, that someone would probably be her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept it was well past midnight and there was no way I was going out on the street in the dark - even if it was lit up like Mardi Gras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I returned to my research, found several articles about dead people in the swamp, cross-referenced them with the phases of the moon, and came up with a list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found no mention of rabid animals, rogue beasts, or a serial killer. Which struck me as odd. Had no one but me and Frank noticed bodies were piling up under the crescent moon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied the dates. Over the past ten years there hadn\u0027t been more than three bodies found per annum. Which was probably why there hadn\u0027t been an outcry. Especially in an area where death lived everywhere and had for a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to my Internet sources, my guidebook, and my memories, New Orleans could have been called the Big Epidemic instead of the Big Easy. As it was located below sea level, between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, yellow fever had loved the place. From 1793 to 1905 there were twenty outbreaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the plagues, they had starvation, war, pestilence. The usual. However, in New Orleans the troubles seemed multiplied. Which is probably why when they partied, they did so for days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to search for deaths, disappearances, locations. About 2:00 A.M. my eyes drooped. I was so tired, I barely got my clothes off before I fell into bed. The next thing I knew, the sun was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo dreams. No visitations. No flowers. A good night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a shower, snagged some coffee, and headed for Cassandra\u0027s. On the street, shopkeepers sprayed the side-walks, flushing away the refuse left over from the nightly celebration. Water dripped from balconies and onto my head as residents watered their plants. I dodged people meandering down Bourbon Street with cocktails in plastic glasses. Had they ever gone home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the shop was locked. I glanced at my watch, then the sign on her window. Two hours until she opened for business. I needed to talk to her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d just lifted my hand to knock when she opened the door. My eyes narrowed. \"How did you know I was here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, leaving the door open. I stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lazarus?\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze, one foot in, one foot out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mind shutting that?\" she called. \"If he sees the daylight, he\u0027ll bolt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed at the thought of Lazarus bolting over my sneakers, or maybe up my leg, and slammed the door. \"How does a snake bolt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is he out of his cage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I let him out at night.\" Cassandra went down on her knees, peeking under one of the display cases. \"Would you want to be stuck in a cage every minute of your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus was a snake. Did he have wants and needs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething skittered across the open space. \"There he is,\" I said, just a little too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra started, bumping her head on the case before giving me a disgusted glare. \"I thought you were a scientist. How can you be afraid of snakes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who said I\u0027m afraid of snakes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me crazy,\" I said stiffly, \"but I don\u0027t like being in a small confined space with a freaking python.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not interested in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight thud caused me to turn. Lazarus was right behind me. I stared at the odd growth in his throat Or was that his neck? Maybe his body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are!\" Cassandra hurried over and snatched him up, popping the snake into his cage, then flipping the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have a tumor?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Horrified, she bent and peered at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThai ing bump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were a zoologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crypto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still - didn\u0027t you study reptiles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As little as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a hand on her hip and tilted her head. \"What do snakes eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rodents.\" The light dawned. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s in his throat\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another reason I set him free at night He\u0027s much better man a cat. Never, ever, brings me a present\" Cassandra shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never had a cat never had a pet Can you imagine my mother allowing an animal to walk on her winter-white carpet? She\u0027d rarely allowed me there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I knew cats liked to share. Or maybe brag. I could see Cassandra\u0027s point, though I\u0027d stop short of befriending a python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra turned away from the snake. \"What brings you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. It was one thing to consider asking the advice of a voodoo priestess in the middle of the night and quite another to actually do it in the daylight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tea?\" She pushed through the beaded doorway without waiting for my answer, which would have been \"ack\" if I hadn\u0027t known that was rude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her into a quaint kitchen. \"Don\u0027t suppose you have coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You suppose right. The stuff will stunt your growth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted a brow at her petite form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" Cassandra set the tea on the table and motioned me into a chair. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself telling her everything. Since Simon\u0027s death I\u0027d had no one to confide in, no one to bounce ideas off of, no one to trust Why I\u0027d chosen Cassandra I wasn\u0027t sure. She just had a way about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her youth, she seemed wise. Her eyes were a little sad, as if she\u0027d seen more than she should. I sensed she\u0027d lost someone, too, someone she\u0027d loved. Despite our differences, I felt a kindred spirit and I responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened to all that I told her, not speaking until I was through. \"Comparing a news photo and a man you saw from pretty far away is a stretch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could be a relative of the deceased. Resemble him just enough to throw you off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra took a sip of her tea, swallowed, set the cup down with a click, and met my gaze. \"Then why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I here? I\u0027m not the spooky type. I don\u0027t believe in this stuff. Yet here I am, asking a voodoo priestess why a dead guy was following me down Bourbon Street Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve lost your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m starting to wonder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you just need a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my gaze. \"That pathetic, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra smiled. \"Not at all. You travel a lot How could you make friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I was any good at it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem pretty good at it to me.\" I half-expected her to reach over and pat my hand. \"Anyway, you came to the right place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a Mend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, too. I like you, Diana. I think I have something that\u0027ll help you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra stood, then headed into the shop. I followed. A quick glance into the snake cage revealed Lazarus at work on his breakfast. At least cats ate their prey, eventually; they didn\u0027t wear it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you see the guy again, blow this into his face.\" She handed me a tiny burlap bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More gris-gris?\" I asked, my fingers searching for, then finding the one I\u0027d stuffed into my back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. This\u0027ll tell you if he\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at the sack. \"It\u0027ll tell me if the man who\u0027s following me down the street is dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassandra, what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brow furrowed. \"Zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zombies!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced. \"You don\u0027t have to shout. What were you asking me about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dead guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was walking. Add them together and that equals zombie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In New Orleans maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In any damn place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. I had come to ask about zombies; I just hadn\u0027t wanted to ask. But now that she\u0027d answered...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are zombies raised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not exactly sure.\" Her lips pursed. \"There are a lot of theories, spells, but I\u0027ve never been able to raise one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve tried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It takes a lot more power than I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Power?\" I couldn\u0027t believe I was talking about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raising the dead is serious business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t believe, even though you\u0027ve seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what I saw. Probably the guy\u0027s cousin, uncle, twin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use the powder; then you\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if I blow this stuff into a zombie\u0027s face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who raises the zombie gives it purpose and strength. His or her power keeps the zombie moving physically. Mentally they just aren\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was starting to get the drift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I blow this in his face - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The magic dies.
