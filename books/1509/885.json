He could travel thousands of kilometers in a blink, but no matter how far or how fast he moved there seem to be no exit. He didn’t know where to go, or which way to focus his power. Despite his god-like strength his attacks struck nothing but empty space wherever he directed them. Through his perception this reality he found himself was as stable as it was infinite, and there appeared to be no breaks for him to exploit. He found himself trapped in a never-ending expanse, a hostile territory with no border he could assault.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat to do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe gravity of his situation began to dawn on him.

From the very beginning they had attacked this monster with their strongest abilities, never letting up.

They knew the definitive moment was near, when it would be determined if humanity would continue or be snuffed out. Prayers were said for the North, the East and the West.

Interestingly, in Chinese this is ‘without lips the teeth suffer cold.’]. If Monarch perished the humans could use this terrible power to destroy everything they labored to build. Their immortal realm could be wiped from existence and all their dreams destroyed. More importantly the Violet Prince was not himself a full immortal.

The one the monster Prince chose to deal with first was not Ultus’ bearer, but Lan Jue. Of all these humans Lan Jue was the one he was most familiar with. There was no sense of kinship among the aliens, but the Prince and Princess had worked closely for years. She had been slain by his hand. It was also Lan Jue’s deception that helped them abscond with Ultus, right from under their nose. He was the reason they were in such a precarious position.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFor these reasons the Prince hated Lan Jue, loathed this arrogant human meat sack.

The mechas raced toward them to help but they were too slow. They had the heart but not the ability. Although Lan Jue was in many ways Captus after their joining, in the midst of the Banishing Strategy he could not defend himself. All he could do was pour all of himself into his task and hope it was enough.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe light of his vitality blazed around him like an inferno.

It was not constrained by either time or space and appeared instantly where it was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Queen of Heaven Guanyin, Qianlin, was the main focus of that faith. Westerners especially placed their belief in her after what she did for their people. But beyond her they said their prayers for the Banishing Strategy itself and the courageous Paragons who were willing to sacrifice everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith their own eyes spectators watched as Paragons were felled one after the other, mostly in giving their own lives so that others can continue the fight or to weaken the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a universe of difference between a normal person and a Paragon. To the common man Paragons were living legends, hardly believable except for the fact that they were often in the public eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of that power still was not enough for many of them, who were slain or gave their lives against an enemy that still threatened their species. This fact put a stark point on the fact that this enemy was powerful beyond belief.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to be united. Unity is strength!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the key the Clockmaker pointed out. All the soldiers of the armada bowed their heads in prayer, hoping against hope for the Banishing Strategy to overcome their foes. Those in other worlds who had yet to lend their faith did so at the Clockmaker’s demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfluenced by this universal favor, Lan Jue and the others continued to grow stronger. They no longer worried about failing to sustain the Strategy, even as its bottomless hunger continued to feed unabated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the Strategy itself the multicolored light became more intense. An archaic and mysterious diagram was beginning to appear between the sword bearers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Ke, who stood beside the Pharmacist, was shocked to discover that some of the people’s faith was directed toward him. His first instinct was to flee, but the gravitational power of the Pharmacist’s halo held him fast. He could feel the energy of prayer seep into him, nourishing his soul. It was comfortable beyond words, a sensation he hadn’t felt since being captured by the monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pharmacist’s face went from strained to peaceful. She could see her late husband’s spectral body becoming more corporeal before her very eyes. He looked almost whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people were not stingy with their prayers. Seeing this spirit beside the Harbinger Faerie, helping her, they assumed he was as important to the Strategy as she was. They had prayers enough for him as well, and thus did he benefit from this disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first to break through was, of course, Lan Jue. There were no dramatic signs to mark it, all of a sudden he just felt like a veil had been lifted from his eyes. Suddenly there was more to everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe universe became a rich and complicated tapestry. Everything he saw and felt was completely different than it had been before. His consciousness felt boundless and untethered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Infinite! Was this what it felt like to truly be one with everything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to the dangerous instability of his breakthrough to Nirvana, now he felt only comfort. With this breakthrough all the damage he’d done in burning away his vitality was reversed. His spirit was restored, and even his Core underwent a qualitative shift. Instead of a solid, crystal-like center it became gas-like, suspended as a cloud of energy in his chest. Its power flickered to life amidst the many-hued halo that enveloped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStranger still, Lan Jue could sense something in the depths of space calling out to him. Whatever it was, it felt as though it were gathering around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were fragments of memories. Somehow he knew that they were pieces of the old masters left behind. Shards of what had been the Middle Heaven Great Emperor of the North Star of Purple Subtlety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stream of purple light extricated itself from him – the image of the Great Emperor. However the depth and wisdom in his eyes was more profound than it ever had been. He was towering, stately, and radiated an aura of godliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the true Emperor of the North Star! A piece only, yet still possessed of the great power the immortal once commanded. Lan Jue could see that was the mighty spirit gazed upon the Strategy there remained a lingering fear of the destruction it manufactured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the time of his reign the Emperor was slightly more than half again as powerful as Celestial Masters Yuan Shi and Taishang. If the Emperor in his fully glory was present, the Strategy may not have been enough to destroy him outright but would certainly have been a threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next one to break through was Zhou Qianlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment of her breakthrough a heavenly chorus rang out through space. As the soothing tones reverberated, ripples of white light radiated out around her. It continued to spread until it enfolded Lan Jue, Lan Qing and the Pharmacist as well. Thus connected the four bearers felt more intimately joined. Each of them absorbed faith different up to this point, Qianlin enjoying the most benefit. However, with her breakthrough it was now evenly distributed among all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiara of water drops glittered like crystal against her forehead. Her dharma also appeared, but like Lan Jue’s was different than before. Her head was covered by a white gossamer veil, and a lotus flower bloomed beneath her feet. In her right hand she held a willow branch, and in the other a jar of pure water. Though just a shadow of the beloved Goddess of Mercy, her appearance was stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuanyin, one of the most beloved of the Buddha. It was nothing short of amazing that Qianlin’s dharma would be revealed as this ancient goddess upon breaking through to the Infinite. Her Paragon title was more apt than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Qing and the Pharmacist broke through at nearly the same moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVairochana’s image appeared from Lan Qing in all its glory and split, replete with an aura of benevolence. Three mighty Buddhas of the past, present and future shone with divine light. Lan Qing opened his eyes, and from them emerged an ethereal golden mist to match the aura that encased him. He was surrounded by the soothing hum of chanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pharmacist’s change was more sensational. Her dharma had always been herself, but that appeared to have changed. In breaking through her abilities assimilated some inexplicable power, and instead of a dharma she was surrounded a burning garnet hue. The contrast was striking when set beside Lan Qing’s luminous aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the borders of that red light was a terrifying scene. Mountains of corpses and seas of blood stretched far and wide. Ghouls and spirits wandered the hellscape howling in rage. Other figured, visible only barely, wandered aimlessly throughout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So long as hell hath sinners, I will not ascend!” Ten words boomed into existence like a voice from the depths. The frightening vision of hell subsided and was replaced by the stern visage of the Pharmacist’s dharma. Its hands were pressed together before its chest, and the being was clad in the simple garb of a monk. Her dharma was revealed as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yama_(Buddhism)#Yama_in_Chinese,_Korean,_and_Japanese_mythology\"\u003eYama\u003c/a\u003e, King of the Underworld!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne after the other their breakthroughs were complete. It took only a matter of moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four sword bearers revealed their legendary lineages, manifest by the power of faith; Middle Heaven Great Emperor of the North Star of Purple Subtlety; Vairochana; Guanyin; King Yama. Each one a figure from the highest echelons of the ancient pantheon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong them Vairochana held the highest status, though the others were considered lesser by small degrees only. As the fragments of these all-powerful beings stood in attendance, the vast powers of the universe gathered to their side. The Banishing Strategy grew ever more powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue and the others had arisen to the vaulted heights of the Infinite, and yet they were not assailed by the threat of universal protogenia. However this was not due to the protective aura from Zhou Qianlin. It simply wasn’t present, as though it ignored them entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe polychromatic light of the Banishing Strategy was an energy that was born at the creation of the universe. Even the immortal qi surrounding Monarch dissolved under its all-pervading dominance. This was similarly true of universal protogenia, a derivative of this energy. So long as they remained within the embrace of the Strategy, the Lan Jue and the others did not need to fear destruction at the universe’ hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real blessing in disguise! None of them expected this Strategy that they were ready to give their life for would protect them in this way. Slowly the Strategy was nearing completion, their plans finally coming to fruition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d expected to only accomplish the minimum of what the Banishing Strategy could do, and use that to kill Monarch. Now, with the power of faith, it was growing stronger than they thought they could manage. Whether or not they would succeed was no longer the question, it was to what extent. This was, after all, the greatest weapon under heaven!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpno sensing this critical change, Lan Jue delivered a message to the Wine Master. “Tell everyone to fall back to Angel. We’re fine from here on out. The Banishing Strategy will be complete any moment, and Monarch will be slain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard this the Wine Master breathed a sigh of relief. It was finally going to end. However, in his eyes there was also sorrow. They had lost so many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatan, the Pontiff, the Terminator, the Keeper, the Bookworm, the Pauper. Jue Di, the Photographer, Poseidon, the Gods of Wine. They had all perished to see this war won.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 900: The Complete Banishing Strategy!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly nine Paragons remained. They were all that was left of humanity’s greatest Adepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wine Master quickly relayed Lan Jue’s command. He also told Kang Hui aboard Tyrannosaurus, which thankfully could still fly. As commander of the armada it was his responsibility to give the order to fall back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pass on my directive. Everyone is to fall back to Angel. Bastions take up the rear. Leave a couple reconnaissance vehicles behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more need be said. Everyone could see the dancing lights within the Strategy. Compared to when they first started the energy surging from it was inconceivable. Even laymen could tell that they were on the cusp of completion. Victory was eminent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five remaining Paragons stayed behind to bear witness while Kang Hui and his soldiers began to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the soldiers were falling back, there was no decrease in the faith afforded to the four sword bearers and their Strategy. Though, it wasn’t just their Strategy anymore. Everyone, all throughout the galaxies, had a hand in its completion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonarch would never have believed that he would be caught by the wiles of man, but such was the case. He struggled and railed against his prison, sure that he could escape if only he found the right place to attack. Before his attacks felt blocked, like they were caught in a mire of that chaotic energy. Now that sense was gone. All of it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe confusion was gone and reality came back into focus, free from the flows of chaos. This lauded Strategy had its limits, he was glad to discover. Monarch was pleased that his golden immortal abilities were able to defeat their ploy. He grinned arrogantly to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at his surroundings as they once more became clear, and reached out with his perception. To his North was Ultus; to his South, Occisus; on his West arose Captus; at his East was Demortus. Before him arose a gate, and from it issued a murderous aura and an evil wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is…\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flashed behind his eyes. He wasted no time, moving quickly toward Ultus. It was the sword he was most familiar with, the one he’d left his mark upon. It would likely be the easiest one to conquer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever as he moved forward to take the sword a portal appear. He slipped through, and was transported back to where he started. He hadn’t gained any ground toward Ultus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Banishing Strategy’s suffocating pressure had dissipated once his surroundings became clear again. It led him to believe the danger was passed. But he was wise, and understanding was clear in his face. Instead of moving forward to seize the weapons himself, instead he lashed out with a punch in each direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaced with Monarch’s all-mighty powers the swords simply flickered. Monarch’s explosions of energies vanished without foundation. He was the most powerful being in a millennia, so he sensed the flows at they reacted to one another. He felt it as the manifestation of his power was shattered and swallowed up like it was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis manufactured human heart sank. Without question, he no longer possessed the power to threaten the trap he’d been caught in. It was in this moment a flash of purple caught his eye. It caught him off guard and he nearly feinted away, but turned fast enough to catch who it was. The Violet Prince was at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prince was ablaze in violet light. Monarch recognized that he was consuming the essence of his Core to empower his abilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monarch!” The Prince greeted weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immortal regarded his progeny with an ominous glare. “Why are you here? Did I not order you to destroy the Strategy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The humans staunchly resisted,” the Prince explained. “Moments before I could break free and attack the sword bearers, the Strategy changed. I was caught.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGazing upon the lesser alien’s beaten and crippled body, he knew it to be true. It meant that the humans had obtained some unknown power to aid them. Whatever it was, it had been enough to help them complete the Strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now Monarch found it difficult to believe that his strength was incapable of breaking them free. The humans were no greater than Nirvana-level, how could they possibly contend against him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was well known that the gulf between an Adept of Nirvana and a denizen of the Infinite was vast. The difference between the Infinite and Immortality was larger still. The potential of an Immortal was vast as the heavens themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his level of cultivation it would require another ten thousand years before he arose to the next degree of domination. If crossing the threshold from one Paragon rank to another was a herculean task, rising in status as an immortal took eons.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonarch’s face darkened. Finally he realized that perhaps he’d overestimated himself. At the final moment, when he thought victory was his, human beings proved their strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing in the genetic material he stole from mankind that told him what this trap was. How could it? There were so few humans who knew of the existence of the Banishing Strategy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monarch, what should we do?” The Prince asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonarch fixed him with a serious gaze. “The only thing we can do is try to break free. Perhaps we can overwhelm their ability to hold us here. I don’t believe these humans can maintain this trap for long. The amount of energy required to hold me here must be immense, and the moment they begin to falter that will be our chance. It’s a test of endurance, how can they challenge me in such a trial? This trap they’ve lain has only kept me stationary – it does not cause any harm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment these words left his lips, the four Banishing Blades glowed brighter. As more portals appeared all around them reality became lest distinct. The areas around them started to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden the swords seemed leagues away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep and booming voice thundered through the interior of the Strategy. “In all of history you are the first to assume this trap lacks bite. Monarch, you must know what it is you face. Regardless, I shall tell you: it is called the Banishing Strategy. In the days of immortals it was called the greatest weapon under heaven. Is it not your goal to attain the highest state of immortality? I may as well tell you, even if you succeeded this very moment the Strategy would reduce you to dust. Were this not so, would its title be so audacious? What you face terrified the gods of old. You – will – die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was Lan Jue’s. It was cold and callous, full of dark promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonarch responded with a dismissive sniff. “Very well! I’m eager to see what your so-called super weapon is capable of!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monarch. Are… are you sure we’ll be fine?” The Prince at his side sounded less than convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScorn dripped from Monarch’s voice. “This is nothing more than a trick to shake our confidence. Greatest weapon under heaven… they have no means to kill me-“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis haughty affirmation were cut short when suddenly reality began to tremble. In the distance eight glimmering portals revealed themselves. Shimmering around them the rainbow of color started to fluctuate. Monarch shook and the Prince quailed. The lights went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Prince looked at his master he was surprised to see shock on Monarch’s face. Before his eyes miniscule cracks appeared upon the immortal’s body, spurting golden light. They started on his head, but quickly spread until they criss-crossed every inch of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a loud clap, Monarch’s body broke apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beam of golden light escaped from where its head had been. It tried wildly to flee in any direction it could. However the flows of sword-energy that had vanished suddenly reemerged from the darkness. The moment the golden light crashed into these lights it froze, and revealed its true nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Monarch, though a miniature copy. The tiny golden homunculus was nimble, but was now frozen with an expression of disbelief writ plain on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Don’t kill me. I’ll surrender the immortal realm. I can teach you how to make one of your own. I can –“ Before he could finish Lan Jue’s voice rumbled from within the tempest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your pleas are useless. Did you think we would allow you to live, after what you did to our people? With every murder you only thought about consuming more – you never spared a thought for those not of your ilk. Goodbye, Monarch. You should be proud to die by the might of the Banishing Strategy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the last syllable hung in the air, an unending torrent of cutting light descended upon him. Monarch’s immortal spirit was cut to ribbons and drifted away to nothing in the emptiness of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Violet Prince witnessed the whole scene. His face had gone ghastly pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonarch – the ascendant, he who consumed the power of both Queen and Consort, the master of their immortal realm – was dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was this possible? How could they have killed a god?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood still, frozen in place, shaking ever so slightly. No thought of confrontation entered his mind, for in the face of that terrifying storm he felt insignificant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it swept through the Violet Prince was rent asunder until nothing remained. He was beneath even a final word from Lan Jue.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-891\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-901\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-896","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:08 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:08 AM"}
