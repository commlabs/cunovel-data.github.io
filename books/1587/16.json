Has it crossed your mind that she may feel obligated to accept your advances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What advances? Nothing happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t decline your invitations. In her mind, you\u0027re putting her into a position where she must accept your overtures or risk being sent back to a hel ish planet where she might be put to death on arrival. You\u0027re putting her into a very difficult position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his hand at her. \"Nothing. Happened. It wasn\u0027t that kind of dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? What did you talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. She asked about Castil a and then I asked her about her childhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Venturo! Do you not see the writing on this wal ? She is a talented girl, smart, efficient, and conscientious. If you keep pushing this, she may quit to escape. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find an admin who can actual y tolerate you, Ven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, incredulous. \"You didn\u0027t even want to hire her! I hired her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However she came to work here, she is here now, she is doing exceptional y well , and I don\u0027t cherish the prospect of having to replace her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenturo raised his hand. \"Enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not fair to her, it\u0027s not -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, enough!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force of Ven\u0027s mind tore out. Lienne fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you wearing a biosuit at this hour?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLienne checked her tablet. \"The log says you\u0027ve been logged into the bionet for the last thirty-five hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve met a psycher,\" he said. \"Young. Female. Grade A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How powerful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen met her gaze. \"She iced me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous. Nobody has been able to ice you since you were sixteen years old...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLienne fell silent. \"For how long?\" she asked final y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLienne dropped into a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she DDS?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"She iced me and took off. I traced her to a portable hub and the connection went dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to find her, Ven. If DDS gets a hold of a psycher who can ice you, Castil a will kil you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, who would you berate then?\" He grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Lienne\u0027s tone was soft. \"Find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLienne rose. \"And Ven...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About our previous conversation: there are ways to go about those things. Your mother knew this and so did your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenturo blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bit extreme, but who will tel you no?\" Lienne shrugged and left the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire kept her haze firmly on her desk. Lienne\u0027s worries were misplaced. She could\u0027ve told her that. The end of the conversation made no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen stepped out of the office. \"Claire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" She forced a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clear my schedule for the rest of the week. Split my shift between Victorio, Rukah, and Daneb. I\u0027m not available for anyone for anything unless it\u0027s an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, looked like he was going to say something else, and returned to his office instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire sipped her tea. It was Friday, and she sat in a soft blue chair of the fourteenth floor recreation room. The room, shaped like a horseshoe, was positioned so the straight wal faced the diagrid. The wal was glass and sometimes Claire stood next to it, looking down the long sheer drop to the lobby. She liked to watch people, knowing that she was all but invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday she just wanted solitude. She\u0027d dimmed the glass wal to near darkness, shutting off the bright light of the afternoon streaming in through the solar panels of the diagrid until only the pale purple and blue mood lighting remained. Her head hummed. Being a replacement Venturo Escana was a tiring business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire took another sip of tea and checked the tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassion raspberry. Hmm. Delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was thirty minutes past five. The building was mostly empty. The support personnel had gone home, eager to escape and start their weekend, with the exception of the psycher assistance unit. Both Rukah and Angelia were logged in, although Rukah was coming to the end of his shift and Angelia was just beginning hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past week Claire had made more executive decisions than she cared to admit. Venturo spent every waking hour logged into the bionet. Attempting to reach him proved futile. He simply brushed her off. Lienne carried her own workload and the couple of times Claire consulted her, the older woman defaulted to \"Ask Venturo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end she resolved most of the problems herself, under the banner of Ven\u0027s authority. If Lienne or he ever realized who had handled most of the arising problems, she would be fired on the spot for overstepping. Claire smiled to herself. Right now getting fired didn\u0027t seem overly tragic. Sure, she would have to find a new job, and her probation period had shrunk to mere six weeks instead of twelve, but it might be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be worth it to be free of Ven. To be free of the fantasy that would never come to pass. She was too proud to spend the entirety of her life as his silent shadow, while he imagined her beating off the prospective assassins with her tablet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen\u0027s mind approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire sipped her tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged from the shadowy hal way, the bionet suit adhering to him like second skin. She ogled him quietly, looking through her eyelashes while pretending to drink from her cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen dropped a stack of pseudo paper next to her and landed on the couch. \"I found you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost panicked, but her shel was firmly in place and thick enough to withstand a probe. \"I wasn\u0027t hiding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you were. Lights are off, your desk is organized, as if you\u0027ve left. If it wasn\u0027t for your bag, I wouldn\u0027t know you were in the building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My desk is always organized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked exhausted. The laugh lines around his eyes seemed more pronounced. His cheeks were withdrawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he radiated a kind of magnetic sexual energy that made her watch him. Being in his presence was like having sex without ever approaching orgasm - she could watch and imagine, but he would never be hers and he would never want her the way she wanted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprawled on the couch, resting his head on the padded arm rest, straightened his legs, and winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCramped. Clocking nearly eighty hours in the bionet in one week will do it to you. She\u0027d done it before and it was unpleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen nodded at the pseudopaper. \"I found these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire glanced at the sheets. The Quattrone Family quote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know Lienne didn\u0027t approve this. Nor did she compile the data for the quote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t feel like lying. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lienne has a best friend, Fotina Heleni. When they were both sixteen, Deo Quattrone stood her up. They were at a party together, and he saw his ex-girlfriend in the crowd with another kid and made a giant scene. It got ugly. Lienne despises him and the whole family. If her hate were a plasma converter, she could launch a thousand spaceships into orbit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire laughed. \"Are you trying to hint that your aunt holds grudges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not hinting. I am saying it. So who helped you with these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"Would it be so terrible if I had done them myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The quote shows a detailed knowledge of the bionet,\" he said. \"Who is the co-conspirator, Claire? I promise I won\u0027t punish anyone. In fact, I may give this person a raise and unload the rest of the quotes on them. Although that would be a punishment in itself, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration boiled up in her. \"You\u0027re right, Ven. A drone like me couldn\u0027t possibly understand the expense involved in structuring the spiral cel protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused on her. \"You are not a drone. We\u0027ve discussed that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you never like to repeat yourself.\" She had to stop talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen sat up, propping himself on the armrest. \"Why are you upset with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay nothing. Say nothing. Claire forced her voice to sound even. \"I am not upset. I\u0027m just tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get it,\" he said. \"Unloading all of my work on your shoulders wasn\u0027t fair. But I have no choice. You can keep your helper a secret, if you wish. I\u0027ll find out eventual y anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you won\u0027t. You can\u0027t find someone who doesn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re stil looking for your mystery woman?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting right here. \"What\u0027s so important about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up. \"Have you ever seen a silver shark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVen reached for her tablet and pul ed up the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers flew over the keys. A large digital screen ignited in the opposite wal . It was intense, deep blue, suffused with rays of pale green light, and she realized she was looking at the depths of the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething stirred far in the distance. A hint of movement shifted the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pale silver star winked in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother ignited close by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire leaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore stars ignited and shimmered with nacre fire, shifting through the entire rainbow spectrum. A serpentine shape swam to her, graceful, beautiful, sheathed with silver scales and rippling with color. The sleek creature paused in front of the camera and coiled, displaying a multitude of wide fins bristling with spikes. There was something hypnotic in the way its body moved, sliding its coils through the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what she was...?\" Claire asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s a silver shark serpent off the Coral Coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept she was more like this.\" Venturo tapped the tablet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea serpent grew, swel ing, fil ing the screen. Her head sprouted ivory horns, tinted with intense electric azure. A mane of silver and blue sheathed her spine, flaring around her head. Some of her fins widened, turning into razor-sharp blades, others grew into wide wheels, rippling with iridescent rainbows. A line of pale blue lights ignited along the serpent\u0027s body. She gathered herself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/silver-shark-kinsmen-2/page-16.html","bookId":1587,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:19:44 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:19:44 AM"}
