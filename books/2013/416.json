She did not know what prompted her to push past Fear Sengar-and attributed no special significance to Clip’s hanging back. A strange tug took hold of her soul, a sudden, excruciating yearning that overwhelmed her growing dread. All at once, the stone spear she held in her hands felt light as a reed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness, a momentary flicker, as of distant light, then she was stepping onto gritty stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cavern. To either side, the raging maws of more gates, flooding all with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her, Silchas Ruin halted and his swords hissed from their scabbards. Someone was standing before him, but in that moment Seren Pedac’s view was blocked by the White Crow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw a barbaric warrior standing further back, and behind him, a lone silhouette standing in the mouth of a tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her left Fear Sengar appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another step, to bring her round Silchas Ruin, to see the one who had made the albino Tiste Andii pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all at once, the terror began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Fear Sengar’s face, an expression of profound horror-even as he surged past Seren Pedac. A knife in his raised hand. The blade flashing down towards Silchas Ruin’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen all of Fear’s forward motion ceased. The out-thrust arm with its knife flailed, slashed the air even as Silchas Ruin-as if entirely unaware of the attack-took a single step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrible gurgling sound from Fear Sengar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning round, Seren Pedac saw Clip standing immediately behind Fear. Saw the chain between Clip’s hands slide almost effortlessly through Fear Sengar’s throat. Blood lashed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond Clip, Udinaas, with Kettle now held tight in his arms, sought to lunge away, even as a shadow erupted beneath him, writhed about his lower limbs, and dragged the Letherii down to the stone floor, where Wither then swarmed over Udinaas. ‘\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip released one end of his chain and whipped the length free of Fear Sengar’s throat. Eyes staring, the expression of fierce intent fixed upon his face, the Tiste Edur’s head sagged back, revealing a slash reaching all the way back to his spine. As Fear Sengar fell, Clip slid in a deadly blur towards Udinaas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrozen in shock, Seren Pedac stood rooted. Disbelieving, as a scream of raw denial tore from her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin’s swords were singing as he closed in deadly battle with whomever stood before him. Staccato impacts as those blades were parried with impossible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWither had wrapped shadow hands around Udinaas’s neck. Was choking the life from the ex-slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKettle pulled herself free, then twisted round to pound tiny hands against the wraith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, a ferocious will burgeoned within Seren Pedac. The will to kill. Launched like a javelin towards Wither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wraith exploded in shreds-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– as Clip arrived, standing over Udinaas and reaching down one hand to grasp Kettle’s tunic between the girl’s shoulder blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip threw the child across the floor. She struck, skidded then rolled like a bundle of rags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith focused punches of Mockra, Seren Pedac hammered at Clip, sending him staggering. Blood sprayed from his nose, mouth and ears. Then he whipped round, a hand lashing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething pounded Seren Pedac high on her left shoulder. Sudden agony radiated out from the point of impact and all her concentration vanished beneath those overwhelming waves. She looked down and saw a dagger buried to the hilt-stared down at it in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no time to think. Trull Sengar was left with naught but recognition. One, then another, arriving in shocks that left him stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the gate emerged an apparition-and Trull Sengar had stood before this one before, long ago, during a night’s vigil over fallen kin. Ghost of darkness. The Betrayer. No longer weaponless, as he had been the first time. No longer half rotted, yet the coals of those terrifying eyes remained, fixed now upon him in bright familiarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, in a low voice, almost a whisper, the Betrayer said, ‘Of course it is you. But this battle, it is not-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Trull Sengar saw his brother. Fear, the god of his childhood, the stranger of his last days among the Tiste Edur. Fear, meeting Trull’s wide eyes. Seeing the battle about to begin. Comprehending-and then there was a knife in his hand, and, as he surged forward to stab the Betrayer in the back, Trull saw in his brother’s face-in an instant-the full measure of Fear’s sudden self-awareness, the bitter irony, the truth of generations past returned once more, one last time. Silchas Ruin, an Edur knife seeking his back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-416.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
