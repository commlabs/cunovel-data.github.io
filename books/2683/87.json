Something about Satan escaping from hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few nods, some appreciative murmuring. I close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking at this place, Victor,\" Damien says. \"And do you want to know what I\u0027m thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvoluntarily I shake my head, realize something, then nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking, Jesus, the zeitgelst\u0027s in limbo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything. Damien spits on me, then grabs my face, smearing his saliva all over my nose, my cheeks, reopening a wound on my mouth where Hurley hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel, Victor?\" he\u0027s asking. \"How do you feel this mornng?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel very... funny,\" I say, guessing, pulling back. \"I feel very... unhip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look the part,\" Damien sneers, livid, ready to pounce, the veins in his neck and forehead bulging, grasping my face so tightly that when I yell out the sounds coming from my mouth are muffled and my vision blurs over and he abruptly lets go, pacing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you ever come to a point in your life where you\u0027ve said to yourself. Hey, this isn\u0027t right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything, just continue sucking in air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it\u0027s beside the point to tell you you\u0027re fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, don\u0027t say anything, have no idea what kind of expression is on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, what do you think you are?\" he asks, baffled. \"A reliable sales tool? Let\u0027s just put it this way, Victor: I\u0027m not too thrilled by your value system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod mutely, not denying anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s good in this business, Victor, and there\u0027s bad,\" Damien says, breathing hard. \"And it\u0027s my impression that you can\u0027t discern between the two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly something in me cracks. \"Hey,\" I shout, looking up at him. \"Spare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien seems pleased by this outburst and starts circling the chair, raising the cigar to his mouth, taking rapid light puffs, its tip glowing off then on then off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes even the desert gets chilly, Victor,\" he intones pretentiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please continue, O Wise One,\" I groan, rolling my eyes. \"Fucking spare me, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smacks me across the head, then he does it again, and when he does it a third time I wonder if that third slap was in the script, and finally Duke pulls Damien back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may park wherever I feel like it, Victor,\" he growls, \"but I also pay the f**king tickets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien breaks free from Duke and grabs my cheek at the place Hurley\u0027s fist struck and twists it upward between two fingers until I\u0027m shouting out for him to stop, reaching up to pull his hand away, but when he lets go I just fall back, limp, rubbing my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just like...\" I\u0027m trying to catch my breath. \"I\u0027m just like... trying to fit this into... perspective,\" I choke, slipping helplessly into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien slaps my face again. \"Hey, look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, you\u0027re shooting from the hip.\" I\u0027m panting, delirious. \"I admire that, man.\" I take in air, gasping. \"I go to jail, right? I go directly to jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, studying me, rubs a hand over his face. \"You act very hard to be cool, Victor, but really you\u0027re very normal.\" Pause. \"You\u0027re a loser.\" He shrugs. \"You\u0027re an easy target with a disadvantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to stand up but Damien pushes me back down into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you f**k her?\" he suddenly asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t say anything since I don\u0027t know who he\u0027s talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you f**k her?\" he asks again, quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll, um, take the Fifth,\" I mumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll take what, you sonofabitch?\" he roars, the two goons rushing over, holding him back from beating the shit out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The photograph\u0027s a lie,\" I\u0027m shouting back. \"The photo was faked.

I duck. They scatter around me, one hitting my lap, faceup, the rest falling to the floor, different photos of Lauren and me making out. In a few shots our tongues are visible, entwined and glistening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are... these?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep them.

They weren\u0027t altered, f**khead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien crosses the room, gradually calming himself down, closes and locks a briefcase, then checks his watch. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-87.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
