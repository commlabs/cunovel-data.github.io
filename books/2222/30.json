She filled the glass with orange juice and drank it down slowly, but I had stopped watching her long before then, turning my attention instead to a foursome of golfers lofting their second shots toward an elevated green beyond St. Ana’s backyard. I knew when I was being played, and while I usually didn’t mind, my inner voice kept repeating, She’s only a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later a woman stepped through the French doors onto the patio. Priscilla St. Ana was handsomely approaching forty-five. Not quite as young and attractive as her air-brushed photo would suggest, I thought, but pretty enough that she could pass for younger. The fact that she had changed her hairstyle helped. Piled high in the photo I had downloaded, it was now cut short. She was dressed in a crisp white shirt, tailored to accentuate her generous bosom and slender waist, and a long, thin black skirt with a silver buckle—two swans with necks intertwined. The skirt’s front slit revealed a graceful leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk took her towel and her orange juice and moved past her as she approached the table. “Your guest,” she said as she passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I see,” Priscilla said. “Mr. McKenzie.” She extended her hand. Her eyes were neither warm nor cold, and they didn’t give much away—a poker player’s eyes. I shook her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I offer you something?” The maid seemed to materialize out of thin air behind Priscilla’s shoulder. “Caroline makes an outstanding iced tea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tea will be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Caroline,” Priscilla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maid disappeared into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I appreciate your taking the time to see me,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at all. Please, sit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat. “You have a lovely home, Ms. St. Ana.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. Please, call me Cilia. I was christened Priscilla by my parents, but I prefer Cilia, the name of my favorite character in Johnny Tremain. No one would call me that while my father was alive. Now everyone does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Caroline reappeared carrying a silver tray with both hands. The tray supported a glass pitcher filled with tea, a bowl of ice, a dish of sliced lemons, a sugar bowl, and two crystal tumblers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Caroline,” Cilia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maid departed, leaving Cilia to fill both glasses herself, offering me one. The umbrella protected us from the hard afternoon sun but not from the heat, and I found myself drinking the tea much too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, help yourself,” Cilia said in a voice that was more polite than friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured another glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilia tossed her head a little so that her blond hair swung and I could see the auburn under the chemicals, close to the scalp. She smiled easily. The heat didn’t seem to bother her at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was pleased before to notice you not noticing my niece,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I noticed her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t ogling. Most men do. I find it distasteful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I make it a point not to ogle women who haven’t voted in at least three presidential elections.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you are an exception to most men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No doubt about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe regarded me carefully over the rim of her glass. “How may I help you?” she asked. Her tone reminded me of my high school math teacher—not antagonistic, merely commanding. I refused to be intimated, as I had been by the math teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to talk about Merodie Davies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you said over the phone. I knew, of course, that Merodie was in trouble. I assumed she would seek my help. I am a bit bewildered that she hasn’t.” Cilia topped off my glass with iced tea. “What would you like to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured toward the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Silk is Merodie’s daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. How did you guess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw a photo of her mother when she was about Silk’s age.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a resemblance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What exactly is your relationship with Merodie Davies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simple question. The answer is a bit more complicated. Why is it important that you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ms. St. Ana, your personal check in the amount of forty-one hundred dollars and change was discovered in Merodie’s house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilia’s eyebrows seemed to knit together as she gazed past the patio and adjacent pool toward the golf course, not seeing any of it. She said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cilia?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cilia. The check.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been paying Merodie an allowance for quite some time now,” she said. “Why does that matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you tell me why you’ve been paying her an allowance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is the mother of my niece. I can’t just let her go homeless, can I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what you told the Anoka County Sheriff’s Department when they questioned you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They haven’t questioned me. Why would they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy inner voice was shouting at me. The cops haven’t pressed Vonnie Lou Lowman or questioned Priscilla St. Ana? What gives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cilia, the check was dated August first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is correct.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t mailed; the envelope had no postmark. You must have hand-delivered it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On August first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably. Why is that significant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the day Eli Jefferson was killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilia’s voice rose in protest. “Are you suggesting . . .?” She stopped herself. A puzzled expression crossed her face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-30.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
