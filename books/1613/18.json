Soap said it was a special shipment.” She began to follow Vieve out the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgatha, who had been listening with interest, said timidly, “You aren’t going outside in your nightgown, Sophronia? What if someone catches you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loan me Sidheag’s duds?” asked Sophronia. “I’ll take the blame if she gets upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgatha puffed out her cheeks but then nodded, disappeared, and reappeared with a familiar set of shirt and trousers. Sometimes even Agatha had gumption. Sophronia put them on and knotted her hair at the base of her neck. She was supposed to put her hair up in rags each night, but she rarely found the time. Plus, the only person any good with curling rags was Monique. Sophronia wasn’t about to ask her for help, even at Lady Linette’s insistence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed Vieve down into the lower part of the rear of the airship, where storage chambers thrummed to the loud hum of the massive propeller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was via this warehouse that Sophronia had first entered Mademoiselle Geraldine’s Academy for Young Ladies of Quality—an ignorant covert recruit. There was a massive hatch and a moving glass platform, used for loading students or goods. The cavernous storage chamber was lit only by a flickering orange glow coming through the slats from guidance engineering. There, specially trained sooties, greasers, and firemen manned the propeller’s boilers and engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise of the propeller allowed the girls to be less cautious with their footsteps, but they still hugged the wall. At the far end, near the propeller room, was a small shed. Usually it housed cleaning supplies, but these were now stacked outside. Inside, someone had lit a gas lamp and was talking quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia held Vieve back. The propeller was loud, but if it was Professor Braithwope inside that shed, he might still be able to smell them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Sophronia decided to risk it, inching forward slowly, her bare feet whisper-soft. Vieve took her cues from the older girl. They reached the side of the shed, and Sophronia pulled out her ear trumpet. She crouched low and pressed it against the small space at the bottom where wall met floorboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“… too bad these were delayed. We could have used this information months ago,” Professor Braithwope was saying. “How could the intermediary let them all pile up like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She seized an opportunity to infiltrate flywaymen. The messages kept coming, but she was afloat, so no one was left to alert us. It wasn’t until I realized we hadn’t had a shipment that we thought to go after them ourselves.” Of all the possible teachers with the vampire, it appeared to be Sister Mattie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are they all from her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. She’s our best, but even she is not that prolific.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But all hers say the same thing, whot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed they do. The question is—how many are involved?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire’s tone was resigned. “And why? They know we have to enter the results of the test into public record.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we overlooking something, Aloysius? Are we certain this is only about the technology?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t it always, whot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose we should head to bed, then. We aren’t getting anything new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVieve and Sophronia dove to the back of the shed, squeezing in behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two teachers emerged, illuminated by a lantern Sister Mattie held high in one hand. She stood by while Professor Braithwope locked the door to the shed. Once finished with the task, the vampire tucked the key into his waistcoat pocket and turned to offer the lady his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stiffened, cocking his head to one side. “Who’s there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia and Vieve barely dared breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might as well come out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two girls exchanged terrified looks, and then Vieve got a very set expression. “You stay,” she mouthed at Sophronia. “I owe you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVieve unclipped the obstructor about her wrist and passed it over. Then she carefully nicked one finger with the sharp edge of her shirt pin, drawing blood. She’s hiding my smell, Sophronia realized. Vampires senses could be befuddled by fresh blood. Then Vieve stuffed her hands into the pockets of her jodhpurs, pulled her cap over her eyes, and sauntered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What ho, Professors,” she said jovially. Just as though she strolled about the ship at all hours turning up where least wanted—which, Sophronia supposed, was exactly what she did do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire looked none too pleased to see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it’s only little Genevieve,” said Sister Mattie, relief in her voice. Really, thought Sophronia, she ought to be better at hiding her emotions. Then again, acting was Lady Linette’s speciality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are a scamp, aren’t you, whot?” said the vampire, not relaxing. “How much did you hear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Mattie said wisely, “A little lovage is a dangerous thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you mean knowledge,” corrected Vieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I do not.” Sister Mattie was very opinionated on the subject of herbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicker than the eye could follow, even had it been broad daylight, the vampire reached out and grabbed Vieve’s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you hear?” he repeated, sounding much more vampirelike than Sophronia had thought he could. His mustache even managed to quiver with malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something about a technology, and whether they were interested or not. And how many.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Mattie clucked. “Now, now, Professor, don’t damage the girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVieve began to struggle. The vampire lifted her by the ear. She struck and kicked out. “Stop it, sir! There’s nothing more, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s odd behavior, thought Sophronia. Not odd for a ten-year-old girl, but Vieve rarely acted like an actual ten-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVieve began to whimper and scrabbled more, raking at the front of the vampire’s chest. “Lemme go, that hurts!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s quite a show, thought Sophronia, but it’s definitively a show. Vieve was no more an actress than Sister Mattie. What is she up to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You realize I will have to report this transgression to your aunt?” The vampire set Vieve down, still angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVieve sullenly rubbed her abused ear. “I suppose so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you do, do you? You’re too young to have transgressions. Now, here, wrap this handkerchief around that finger and come along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, the two professors, trailing a protesting Vieve, walked the long stretch across the warehouse floor and left, shutting the door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of blood, all that propeller noise, and Vieve’s whining had effectively hidden Sophronia’s presence. She wondered if the same trick would work on a werewolf. I must really learn more about the limits of supernatural abilities. She sent a thought of thanks after Vieve. I guess that’s a fair exchange for betraying my sootie visits to Dimity and Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was mystified as to why the girl had thrown such a tantrum. She felt around the floor where the vampire had shaken Vieve. Sure enough, as she patted, she happened upon the key to the shed. Professor Braithwope had put it into his waistcoat pocket, and Vieve had thrown her fit in order to pinch it for Sophronia. Blast it, Sophronia thought, now Vieve is one up on me and I owe her! I shall have to put some serious thought to getting rid of Shrimpdittle so she can go become an evil genius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia put the key in the shed door and turned it slowly. The bolt clicked over, but if the cargo was that important, there would be more than a lock guarding it. Inside Sophronia could just make out that the shed was set up like a lady’s sitting room. There were multiple low couches, a very ornate chaise longue—all brass fittings and cream brocade—and fifty or more embroidered throw cushions. There was even a tea trolley near the door, complete with teapot and a plate of small cakes. She had no doubt those were from Mademoiselle Geraldine’s collection. Sophronia was not fooled by all the detail; no one set up a shed like this unless they were trying to hide something in plain sight. She checked the doorway for traps. She ran her hand cautiously along the jamb on each side and down the center for a trip wire. Nothing. Most atypical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautiously, she moved into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ornate chaise across the way emitted a puff of steam from under its brocade ruffle and whirled to life. It had an affronted aspect, as though it were a mother goose and the decorative pillows strewn all about were its eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chaise charged Sophronia, who leapt to one side, bounced up onto a couch, and, in lieu of any other weapon, grabbed one of the cushions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chaise whirled on one of its legs, tassels flying. Its gilt decoration and upholstery disguised copious elaborate mechanisms. It faced Sophronia again, skittering from one side to the other, unable to jump up after her and unwilling to charge and break the other couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia waived the pillow at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chaise puffed smoke out a back slat and waved two tassels with obvious menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, it didn’t seem to be able to sound the whistle alarm like a maid mechanical, nor the trumpeting blast like a soldier mechanical, but it was not going to let her out of the shed, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts protocol probably dictates that it hold infiltrators here and not allow them to escape until someone checks. I could be at this all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia glanced around. There was no way out except the door by which she’d entered, and the chaise had that defended. She couldn’t see any weapons mounted on the angry furnishing. In fact, it seemed nothing more than a rather cushy—albeit autonomous—couch. Nevertheless, it looked as though it would crush her if she went for the door. It was certainly fast and heavy enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia considered firing her hurlie and swinging over the chaise and out like a circus acrobat, but there was no hooking point. Plus, she would not have gotten what she came for: the information Professor Braithwope and Sister Mattie had extracted from this room. There must be messages stashed somewhere in the arrangement of the shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were at an impasse, Sophronia and the chaise longue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feinted left and the sofa followed. She feinted right. It mirrored her on the ground. She made as if to throw the pillow, and it huffed out smoke in indignation and reared on its two stubby back legs, fighting the air with it forelegs like an angry horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia frowned. They had been taught various forms of secret communication—quilting, knitting, crocheting, and lacework code. Perhaps the embroidery on the pillows conveyed information from active intelligencers trained at Mademoiselle Geraldine’s. If it contained communiqués from London, this would make for important cargo indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the enraged chaise, which was holding position, Sophronia squinted at the cushion she held. It was too dark to make out any of the crewelwork. The code was probably contained in the colors and numbers of threads as well as the details of each image. It’d be impossible to interpret the meaning without a companion cypher book. Perhaps Sister Mattie had the cypher memorized and that’s why she’d been along. Whatever the case, there was no point in Sophronia’s stealing a pillow, tempting as it may be. Sophronia suddenly remembered that Vieve had loaned her the obstructor. She wasn’t certain it would work on a mechanical without a track, but it was worth a try. She aimed at the perturbed furniture and let loose a silent blast. The sofa froze. It suffered this indignity with an aura of perturbation. Sophronia dropped the pillow, jumped down, and then leapt onto another couch before the chaise came back to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt whirred into animation, let out a puff of affronted smoke, and whirled to charge Sophronia at her new location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia blasted it again and repeated the process until she perched precariously atop the tea trolley, which sat closest to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit the chaise with one last obstructor blast before swinging herself around the jamb, crashing open the door with both feet, and landing on one knee in the warehouse beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sofa clattered back into motion and came after her but was confined to the shed. It stopped in the doorway, glaring at her and shaking threatening tassels—if an object without eyes can be said to glare. Sophronia felt sorry for the chaise longue, but she wasn’t going to risk being caught in order to mollify a gaudy piece of furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning Mademoiselle Geraldine’s left its Dartmoor home and began to float out over more populated areas. The students were reminded curtly at breakfast by Sister Mattie that “people who live in dirigibles should not throw chamber pots.” The remark was met with censure by Mademoiselle Geraldine but appeared to have been predicated on action taken by the visiting boys, who snickered knowingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe propeller could no longer be activated during the day, for it blew too much of their cover away. They lost speed and bobbed up most of the time, trying to catch breezes heading toward London. Suddenly, Sophronia understood the excitement over Giffard’s accomplishment. Riding those impossibly high-up aether currents would allow them to move with both speed and stealth. At present, only on cloudy days and at night could they could fire up the propeller and move with any kind of purpose. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/curtsies-conspiracies-finishing-school-2/page-18.html","bookId":1613,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:25 PM"}
