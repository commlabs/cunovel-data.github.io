KOLANSII CITIZENS had emerged from the city, and after five days of hard labour the vast trenches, revetments and redoubts had been transformed into long barrows. Three such barrows now stood to mark the Battle of Blessed Gift, where the Letherii, Bolkando, Gilk and Teblor had fought the army of Brother Diligence; and at the foot of the fissured ruin of the Spire, three large barrows of raw earth rose to commemorate the fallen Imass, Jaghut, K’Chain Che’Malle and Kolansii, with one smaller mound holding the remains of two Malazans. And it was at this last place that figures now gathered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemaining at a respectful distance, close to the now-abandoned work camps of the diggers, Lord Nimander stood with Korlat and his uncle, Silchas Ruin. Along with Skintick and Desra, and Apsal’ara, they had accompanied the troops commanded by Captain Fiddler on this long, tedious journey to the coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not hard to mourn the death of brave men and women. Nor even reptilian soldiers bred for war. There was no shame in the tears that ran from Nimander’s face when he came to learn of the slaughter of the Imass in the moment of their rebirth. The survivors had departed some days ago now, into the north – seeking their leader, he had been told, whose fate after the battle remained unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the brother of his father, standing now at his side, had grieved over the destruction of an old friend, Tulas Shorn, in the draconic War of Awakening. The sword strapped to Silchas Ruin’s hip still held bound to its blade the souls of three surviving Eleint from Kurald Emurlahn. The details of this binding were still unclear to Nimander, and his uncle seemed to be a man of few words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore rain threatened from the east, and Nimander watched the dark grey wall of clouds drawing ever closer. He glanced over at Korlat. Something had awakened her own grief, and it had struck deep in the Sister of Cold Nights. And as the distant figures now closed about the small barrow, he saw her take a half-step forward and then halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Korlat,’ said Nimander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught herself, turned to him wretched eyes. ‘Lord?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is not our place to intrude upon them at this time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I understand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I believe it is nevertheless fitting that we convey our respect and honour in some fashion. I wonder, could I ask you, Sister of Cold Nights, to represent us by attending their ceremonies on our behalf?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was released from her face, suddenly softening it, awakening once more her extraordinary beauty. She bowed to him. ‘Lord, I shall go at once.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander watched her make her way towards the ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Silchas Ruin said, ‘She was ever favoured by your father, Lord.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Silchas, she gave her heart to a human, a Malazan, who died in the conquest of Black Coral.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white-skinned man was silent for a moment, and then said, ‘He must have been … formidable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My experience with these Malazans has thus far been brief – I recognize the uniforms from my … attempt on Letheras. To say that they have earned my respect is something of an understatement. I would not willingly cross them again.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander looked at his uncle, wondering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentative, weakened by a sudden feeling of temerity, Korlat’s steps slowed when she was still forty or more paces away from the gathering of dignitaries. Off to her left, assembled in formation, stood the ranks of Malazans – the army known by the name of Bonehunters. Beyond them, arrayed on a higher vantage point, were the far more numerous ranks of the second Malazan army, the Host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her right, where the K’Chain Che’Malle had encamped, the Ve’Gath and K’ell Hunters had formed up in a facing line, the Matron foremost among them. A human woman was walking out from that formation, on a route that would intersect Korlat’s own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps she would find strength in that company. Failing that, she doubted she would manage to get much closer. Her heart felt laid bare – she had believed her days of deepest grief were past. But seeing those Malazan marines – seeing Hedge, Quick Ben and Kalam – had cut her open all over again. When they had seen her – when at last Nimander had judged it time to approach that fated barrow – they had but nodded in greeting, and she could admit now that the distance they had maintained since had hurt her in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps they thought that she had been intent on stealing their sergeant away from them. Perhaps, even, they blamed her for his death. She did not know, and now she had been commanded to join them once more, at this place where two Malazan marines were interred. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-465.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
