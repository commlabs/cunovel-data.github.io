She pushed past him, stepped into his foyer, and took a look around. Books were piled everywhere. Some had fallen, looking like crumbling towers. There were framed photographs on the table. Loren studied them. She picked one up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This your wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the picture down and turned to him. It would be corny to say that his past was written on his face, that prison had somehow not only changed the inside, but the outside as well. Loren wasn\u0027t a fan of that stuff. She didn\u0027t believe the eyes were the windows to the soul. She had seen killers with beautiful, kind eyes. She had met brilliant people who had that open-eyed vacancy thing going on. She had heard jurors say, \"I knew he was innocent the minute he walked in the court- you can just tell\" and knew that it was total, awful nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that said, there was something in Matt Hunter\u0027s stance, in the tilt of the chin maybe, in the line of the mouth. The damage, the defensiveness, emanated from him. She couldn\u0027t put her finger on why, but it was there. Even if she hadn\u0027t known that he\u0027d served hard time after a fairly comfortable childhood, would she still feel this unmistakable vibe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought the answer was yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren couldn\u0027t help but think back to Matt as a kid, a good, goofy, sweet-natured kid, and a pang of sorrow skipped through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you tell Lance?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked him if I was a suspect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A suspect in what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was evasive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a suspect,\" she said. \"Not yet anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that sarcasm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt Hunter shrugged. \"Could you ask your questions quickly? I have to be someplace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have to be someplace\"- she repeated, making a production of checking her watch-\"at this hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m something of a party animal,\" he said, stepping back onto the stoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I somehow doubt that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren followed. She glanced about the neighborhood. There were two men drinking out of brown paper bags and singing an old Motown classic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the Temptations?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four Tops,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always mix those two up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to him. He spread his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly Livingston, is it?\" Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you\u0027re moving back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a nice town to raise a family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I wouldn\u0027t go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That a threat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s meant to be literal. I, me, Loren Muse, would never want to live there again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To each his own then.\" He sighed. \"We done with the small talk now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. So what happened to this nun, Loren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even remember what Lance told me her name was. Sister Mary Something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister Mary Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. So how do I fit in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren debated how to play this. \"How do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and started to walk past her. \"Good night, Loren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, okay, that was dumb. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt turned back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her phone logs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister Mary Rose made one call we can\u0027t figure out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt\u0027s face showed nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know her or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt shook his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the log shows that she placed a call to your sister-in-law\u0027s residence in Livingston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"She called Marsha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sister-in-law denied receiving any calls from anyone at St. Margaret\u0027s. I also talked to that Kylie girl who rents from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Kyra, not Kylie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, whatever. Anyway, I know you stay there a lot. I know, in fact, that you stayed there last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt nodded. \"So you figured- drumroll, please- that I must be the one this nun called,\" he finished for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t this the part where I get all angry and say it only makes sense because you have a bias against an ex-con, even though he\u0027s served his time and paid his debt to society?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made her smile. \"What, you just want to skip the indignation? Move right to your denial?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would speed things up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t know Sister Mary Rose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. For the record, I don\u0027t know any Sister Mary Rose. I don\u0027t even think I know any nuns. I don\u0027t know anybody connected with St. Margaret\u0027s, except, well, according to Lance, you went there, so I guess the answer would be: only you. I have no idea why Sister Mary Rose would call Marsha\u0027s house or even if indeed she called Marsha\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren decided to shift tracks. \"Do you know a man named Max Darrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he call Marsha too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a straight answer, Matt? Do you know a Max Darrow from Raleigh Heights, Nevada, yes or no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolt. Loren saw it. A small one- the smallest of tells on Matt\u0027s face. But it was there- a slight widening in the eyes. He recovered in less than a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never heard of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never. Who is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll read about him in the paper tomorrow. You mind telling where you were yesterday? I mean, before you got to Marsha\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about telling me anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked off, closed his eyes, opened them again. \"This is beginning to sound more like a full-fledged, suspectlike interrogation, Detective Muse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inspector Muse,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either way, I think I\u0027ve answered enough questions for tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re refusing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m leaving.\" Now it was Matt\u0027s turn to check his watch. \"I really have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I assume you\u0027re not going to tell me what you\u0027re up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You assume correctly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren shrugged. \"I could always follow you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll save you the time. I\u0027m heading to the MVD offices in Newark. What I do once I\u0027m inside remains my own business. Have a pleasant night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This might sound weird,\" Loren said, \"but it was good seeing you. I mean, I wish it were under different circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost smiled. \"Same here.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-24.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
