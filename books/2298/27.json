And then he laughed. \"And what a sweet treat you will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, Vicki stared at him. Pushing her fear aside, she tried to remember what Duncan had told her about making a vampire depart. But Falco was on her before she could form the words. His hand closed around her throat, squeezing, tighter, tighter, until all she could see were his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista made his way down a street crowded with parents and kids, most of them in costume. Ballerinas, devils, elves, witches, warlocks, and vampires. On this one night, his dark clothing and long black coat fit right in. Knowing that Tom Duncan now considered him fair game, Battista kept his senses alert as he turned down the street toward Victoria \u0027s house. He glanced at the night sky, quietly cursing the need that had sent him in search of prey. He was late tonight. She had probably already left for the diner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing at the end of the walkway leading to her house, he lifted his head and sniffed the wind. \"Falco.\" The man\u0027s foul stench polluted the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying up the stairs, Battista knocked on the door. There was no answer. The door opened at the touch of his hand. Her handbag and keys lay on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith preternatural speed, he hastened to the diner. Hoping against hope, he glanced in the window, his gaze sweeping the inside. There was no sign of Victoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying through the front door, he cornered Bobbie Sue. \"Where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes grew wide. \"I… I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she come to work tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"N… No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore a vile oath. \"He\u0027s got her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who… Who\u0027s got her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Falco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your hands off her and step away, Battista.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, Antonio came face-to-face with Tom Duncan. \"Falco has taken Victoria,\" he said, unable to hide the desperation in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m taking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you not hear what I said?\" Battista demanded. \" Victoria \u0027s life is in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First you,\" Duncan said resolutely, \"and then him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista snorted. \"Are you going to stake me here, in front of all these people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan glanced around. Though their conversation had been too low to be heard by others, the diner\u0027s customers were all looking in their direction, curious as to what was going on between the two men and the waitress. To onlookers, it no doubt looked like two men arguing over a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are wasting time that we cannot afford to waste,\" Battista said. Dropping Bobbie Sue\u0027s arm, he left the diner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, wait a minute!\" Duncan hurried after Battista, but when he reached the sidewalk, there was no sign of the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloaked in the shadows of the night, Battista closed his eyes and sought for the sound of Victoria\u0027s heartbeat amongst the hundreds of others in the town, thanking whatever Fates there were that she had allowed him to take her blood the night before. Doing so had forged a link between them that could not be broken so long as one of them survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took only moments for him to separate hers from all the others. Like a wolf on the scent, he followed the beat of her heart. It led him out of Pear Blossom Creek, across the state highway and the weed-infested field beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heartbeat grew louder as he climbed a hill and descended the other side. There, he found a small house built of weathered wood and stone. There were iron bars on the windows, iron-barred security doors at the front and the back. A chain-link fence surrounded the property. A padlock secured the gate. Two large Dobermans paced the length of the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo lights shone in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed softly, wondering how he had missed finding this place before. It provided little consolation to know that Duncan hadn\u0027t found it, either, he thought, uttering a wordless sound of disdain. He was surprised the hunter could find his way home without a map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDissolving into mist, Battista floated over the fence, then slipped under the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside the cottage, he assumed his own shape. Standing in the dark, he listened to the sounds of the house, then followed the siren call of Victoria \u0027s heartbeat. It led him through a small door in the kitchen and down a flight of stairs that ended in the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frantic beat of her heart came to him more loudly now, as did the sound of her breathing, rapid and afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second door led into a larger room swathed in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Victoria chained to the wall across from the door, her arms drawn over her head, held in place by a pair of heavy silver manacles that gleamed even in the dark. A second set of manacles bound her ankles. For a moment, her appearance startled him, and then he realized she was wearing a Tinkerbell costume and the odd protrusions at her back were wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved quickly to her, wondering, fleetingly, how Falco had managed to bind her with silver chains, but his relief at seeing her alive and well overcame every other thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped when he placed his hand on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh, my sweet one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antonio! Oh, Antonio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Antonio.\" From the doorway, Dimitri Falco\u0027s voice mimicked Victoria \u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista whirled around, quietly cursing as Falco\u0027s familiar stink stung his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him!\" Falco\u0027s voice echoed off the stone walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hulking shapes moved past Falco. With his preternatural sight, Battista saw the vacant expression in their eyes, knew that Falco had bent their minds to his will. Two of the zombies carried long wooden stakes. The other two carried vials of holy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalco screamed, \"What are you waiting for? Kill him, you fools!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies carrying the holy water threw it in Battista\u0027s direction. He raised his arms to protect his face, swore as drops of water sprayed over his hands, face, and neck like acid rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie nearest him lunged forward, the wooden stake clutched in his fist driving toward Battista\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a cry, Antonio dissolved into mist and fled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraveling on the wings of the night, he returned to the diner in search of Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the hunter seated at a back table devouring a steak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom looked up, startled, when Battista suddenly appeared in the chair across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire looked even worse than he had before. Fresh blisters spread like freckles across his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help,\" Battista said urgently. \"Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no time to waste. I know where \u0027 Victoria is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan dropped his fork on the table. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue hurried toward them. \"Tom, where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To get Victoria. See ya later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! I want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! You stay here!\" Duncan said, and followed Battista out into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My car\u0027s this way,\" Duncan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, they were at the house in the hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan killed the engine and turned off the light. \"You think she\u0027s still here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Battista said curtly. Getting out of the car, he started toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on a minute,\" Duncan called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista grimaced as Duncan opened the trunk of the Camaro and pulled out a stake, a hammer, and a large bottle of holy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan grinned. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped grinning when two Dobermans materialized out of the darkness, barking frantically. \"You got a plan for getting past the dogs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking hold of the padlock in one hand, Antonio gave a sharp jerk and it came away in his hand. \"Wait here,\" he said, and slipped through the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing, both dogs walked stiff-legged toward him. And then, as his gaze met theirs, they dropped to the ground, tails wagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout waiting to see if Duncan was following, Antonio headed for the back door. As expected, the iron security door was locked. Grasping two of the bars, he gave a good hard yank. There was an unearthly screech as the bolts were torn out of the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the iron grate aside, he kicked in the wooden door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no sooner done so than the four zombies rushed toward him out of the darkness, illuminated by a faint shaft of moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed the first one and broke its neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, Duncan drew his revolver and fired three quick shots. It dropped the remaining zombies in their tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunting softly, Battista hurried down the stairs to the basement. The smell of fresh blood grew stronger as he neared the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria \u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the door, he rushed to her side, grief and rage welling from deep within him when he saw the gaping wound in the curve where her neck and shoulder met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing back his head, he howled his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan stood in the doorway, stake in one hand,.38 in the other. \"Is she dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\" Antonio reached for the manacle that spanned her right wrist, only to jerk his hand away, hissing with pain, as the silver blistered his flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s a key?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll have to do it the hard way. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista stroked Victoria \u0027s brow. \"My sweet one, can you hear me?\" He stroked her cheek with his uninjured hand. Her skin was cold beneath his fingertips, her breathing shallow. Ripping a strip of cloth from his shirttail, he wrapped it around the hideous wound in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up as Duncan ran into the room, a pair of bolt cutters in his hand. In moments, he had cut through the chains. \"Let\u0027s get out of here. We\u0027ll worry about the cuffs later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, Battista put his arms around Victoria, holding her upright while Duncan cut the chains at her feet. As soon as she was free, Antonio swung her into his arms and carried her up the stairs and out of the house. The dogs whined softly when he went out of the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched impassively as Duncan set fire to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t be coming back here, that\u0027s for damn sure.\" Duncan glanced at Victoria. \"Is she…?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-27.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
