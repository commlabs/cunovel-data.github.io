THE COOK FEELS THAT ALL THE WORLD NEGLECTS HIM, AND THEN HE GETS A LETTER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Sir Richard Blunt left the shop, and Johanna had just time to conceal the scrap of paper which she had found in the waistcoat, and to seem to be busy at the fire, when Todd made his appearance. She had never seen such a grim smile upon Todd\u0027s face as it now wore. He was for once in his life fairly pleased. When had he made such a morning\u0027s work as that? Not even in his acquisition of those fatal Pearls had he gained so much as by that one slight push that had sent Mrs. Lovett and her claims into the river so neatly. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No wonder Sweeney Todd was elated and delighted. He had all the money now to himself. There was no one now to say to him \"Where is my share?\" He had all the produce of another\u0027s awful criminality to add to his own. Was he not thus a very happy man for a little while?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sunshine of the heart was not a thing to last long in such a bosom as Sweeney Todd\u0027s. His was not that sweet and lasting hilarity of soul that can alone arise from a deep and sincere consciousness of right. No! The fierce delight of a successful stroke of villany may for a time resemble happiness, but it is a resemblance as weak as that between the faint watery ray of a winter\u0027s sun and the full blaze of the god-like luminary in all the beauty of the vernal season.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But for the time, we say, Todd was pleased, and the demoniac triumph of his soul beamed forth from his eyes and played around the puckered corners of his huge mouth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Charley,\" he said, \"how goes it with you, my lad?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Johanna stared as well she might to hear Todd speak in such a mild pacific sort of way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir?\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I say, how goes it with you, my good boy. How have you passed the time in my unavoidable absence upon a little business?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Quite tolerable, sir, thank you, with the exception that a dog pushed his way into the shop, and, as you see, sir, has made some confusion.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A dog?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir. A large one, black and white. I had no strength to turn him out, so he had his will in the shop, and tossed the things about as you see, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My malediction upon that confounded dog. He is mad, Charley, I tell you, he is stark, staring mad. Why did you not throw open razors at him until one had transfixed him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t like touching the razors, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t—you don\u0027t? He! he! What will he think when one touches him?\" muttered Todd to himself as he turned aside and made a movement as though cutting a throat. \"You don\u0027t like touching the razors, Charley?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir, I thought you would be angry if I had, so the dog had all his own way here. I would have put the place to rights, but I thought you aught to see it as it is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Right, my boy—right. To-morrow will be quite time enough to put it to rights. Yes, to-morrow. Has any one called, Charley?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well I am glad of that, for when one is off upon an action of charity one don\u0027t like one\u0027s business to suffer as well. It\u0027s quite unknown what I give away, and I always like to see the object myself, you know, Charley, as I find I can then better adapt my benevolence to their real wants, which is a great—a very great object.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think it was, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are a clever observant lad, Charley, and you will, when you leave me, I feel convinced, drop into a genteel independence. You will want for nothing then, I feel quite assured, Charley.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are very good, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I strive to be good, Charley, and by the help of the gospel we may all be good to some extent—sinners that we are. Now, simple as is, it\u0027s really a great thing to be supplied in an unlimited manner with cold water.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No doubt of it, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I have supplied the person to whom my benevolence has extended this morning, with, I hope, an unlimited quantity, and always fresh. He!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd here executed one of his awful laughs, and then went into his parlour grinning at his own hideous facetiousness over the murder he had committed. Johanna had managed to say, from time to time, what was expected by way of answer to him, but it was with a shuddering consciousness that he had been about some great crime that she did so; and when he had left the shop, she said faintly to herself—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He has murdered Mrs. Lovett.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was sufficient, if Todd went out with an enemy and came home jocular, to conclude what had happened. That person then might be fairly presumed to be no more, and hence, with a shudder of horror pervading her frame, did Johanna whisper to herself—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He has surely murdered Mrs. Lovett.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The first thing that Todd did when he was alone in his parlour, and the door fast, was to produce the memoranda he had made of all that he had to do previous to leaving England. One item ran thus:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mem. To pay Mrs. Lovet in full.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After that item he wrote paid, and then he laughed again in his hideous way, and leaning his head upon his hand, or rather his chin upon it, he spoke in a chuckling tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She will turn up some day—yes, she will turn up some day, and the swollen disgusting mass, that was once the bold and glittering Mrs. Lovett, will be pulled through the river mud by a boat-hook, and then there will be an inquest, and a verdict of found drowned, with a statement that the body was in too advanced a state of decomposition to be identified. Ha!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd actually rubbed his hands together, and then he took a good drop of brandy, and felt himself quite a pleasant sort of character, and one upon whom the fickle goddess, Fortune, had taken to smiling in her most bland and pleasant way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When I am snug and comfortable at Hamburgh,\" he said, \"how eagerly I shall look for the London papers, to let me know how far the fire in Fleet Street, that is to happen to-night, has extended. How I shall laugh if it travel to the old church, and burns that down likewise. Ha! I think I shall take to laughing as a regular thing when I am fairly abroad with all my money, and safe—so safe as I shall be, so very—very safe.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yes, there sat Sweeney Todd rejoicing. He might have said with Romeo in Mantua—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My bosom\u0027s lord sits lightly in his throne,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And all this day an unaccustomed spirit\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But as it was with the young husband of the sainted Juliet, the day of reckoning was coming to Todd, and the spirit that spoke of comfort, joy, and security to his heart and brain, was after all a false one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But we must leave Todd to his self-felicitations, while we request the reader\u0027s kind company to Bell Yard, for certain things had taken place in the establishment of Mrs. Lovett which it is highly necessary should find a place in this veracious and carefully collected narrative.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Mrs. Lovett, with a full notion of the projected perfidy of Todd, left home for the purpose of bringing that individual to a sense of his wrong doings, and insisting upon a settlement, she did not awaken popular remark or popular interest by shutting up her shop, but she took such measures as she believed would last very well until she got back again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was not sanguine upon the subject of getting back very soon, for she had made up her mind that back she would not come without the money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Previously, then, to leaving, she sought the narrow opening in the strong iron-door through which she was accustomed to speak to the discontented cook, and fastening a bottle of wine by the neck to a piece of cord, she let it down into the prison-house of pie-manufactory, saying as she did so—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I keep my word with you. Here is wine. I trust that you will keep your word with me. A batch is wanted at twelve to-day, as you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well,\" said the cook. \"Very well. They shall be ready. But you promised me freedom, Mrs. Lovett.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did, and freedom you shall have shortly. All you have to do now is to attend to business for a little while. When I ring at twelve, send up the batch.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will—I will. But yet—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you only could fancy, Mrs. Lovett, what it was to pass one\u0027s time in this place, you would have some feeling for me. Will you send or bring me some real butcher\u0027s meat?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bang went the wicket-door, and the cook found himself once again shut out from the world in those dismal vaults of Mrs. Lovett\u0027s house.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Twelve o\u0027clock,\" muttered Mrs. Lovett, as she proceeded to her parlour. \"I shall surely be home by twelve. Todd will find out that I am too persevering for him. His fears will force him to pay me, although his justice never would. I will threaten him into payment. The odious villain! to attempt yet to deprive me of all that I have toiled for, with the exception of what of late I have had the prudence to keep in the house!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next thing that Mrs. Lovett had to do was to get some one to effectually mind the shop in her absence, and for that purpose she pitched upon a Mrs. Stag, a tall, gaunt-looking female, who acted as a kind of supernumerary laundress in Lincoln\u0027s Inn. With this person Mrs. Lovett felt that she need have no delicacy as regards locking-up and so forth; and as Mrs. Stag laboured under a defect of hearing, she would not be likely to pay any attention to what might take place below; but still Mrs. Lovett was determined to leave nothing to chance, and she left Mrs. Stag a note which was to go down on the movable platform to the cook in case she, Mrs. Lovett, was not at home at the twelve o\u0027clock batch. This note contained the following words, which, as Mrs. Stag\u0027s parents and guardians had omitted to include reading in her education, were perfectly safe from her scrutiny—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Send up the four o\u0027clock batch, and you will be free within twenty-four hours from then.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This she concluded would keep him quiet; and within twenty-four hours Mrs. Lovett felt that her affairs must be settled in some way or another; so that it was a very safe promise, even if she had not still retained in her own hands the means of breaking it if there should be occasion so to do.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Truly, Mrs. Lovett was, in the full acceptation of the term, a woman of business.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Stag was sure to look in the first thing in the morning upon Mrs. Lovett; so that as soon as that useful and submissive personage made her appearance in Bell Yard, she was duly installed in authority in the shop—the parlour being properly fastened up against Mrs. Stag and all intruders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will be so good as to sit here until I come back, Mrs. Stag?\" said Mrs. Lovett; \"and sell as many pies as you can. I am going to the christening of a friend\u0027s child, who is anxious that I should be its godmother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What a delightful godmother Mrs. Lovett would have made!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" said Mrs. Stag.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think I shall be back at twelve o\u0027 clock; but if I am not, you can let this note go down with the empty tray on the trap-door after you have slid off it the twelve o\u0027 clock batch of pies.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will answer no questions to any one. All you have to say is, that I am out in the neighbourhood, and may come home at any minute, as indeed I may. I shall, of course, pay you, Mrs. Stag, for your whole day. Pray help yourself to a pie or two, as you feel inclined. Good morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good mornin\u0027, ma\u0027am, good mornin\u0027. She\u0027s a very pleasant woman,\" said Mrs. Stag, after Mrs. Lovett had left; \"she\u0027s a remarkably pleasant woman. What a delicious pie, to be sure!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Stag was deep in the mysteries of a yesterday\u0027s veal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s very odd,\" added the laundress, as she wiped the gravy from the sides of her mouth; \"it\u0027s very odd that Mrs. Lovett is so very particular in shutting up her parlour always, when she might know what a likely thing it is that anybody may want to look at the drawers and cupboards. It\u0027s a most remarkable thing to think what she can have there that she will lock up in such a way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upon this, just with a faint forlorn sort of hope that the door might be left open, Mrs. Stag tried it, but it was fast; and, with a sigh of disappointment, she returned to her seat again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In another moment a yesterday\u0027s pork yielded up its fascinations to the appetite of Mrs. Stag.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This, then, was the sort of life that Mrs. Stag passed in the shop. Lamentations and gravy—gravy and lamentations; and while she was thus occupied, the cook was pacing the cellars in rather a discontented mood, with his hands behind his back, reflecting upon things past, present, and to come, and upon his own dismal situation in particular.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I cannot stand this,\" he said, \"I really cannot stand this. I have had promises from Mrs. Lovett of freedom, and I have had similar promises from he who came to the grating in the door, but none of the promises have been fulfilled. I cannot stand this any longer, it is impossible. I am driven mad as it is already. I must do something. I can no longer exist in this way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The cook looked about him, as many people are in the habit of doing when they say they must do something, without having a very clear notion of what it is to be; but as he at length fixed his eye upon that piece of machinery, far up to the roof, by which the batches of pies went up to the shop, and by which flour and butter and other matters, always excepting meat, found their way down to him, an idea took possession of him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What that idea was will show itself in another place.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89659.html","bookId":510,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:25:46 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:25:46 AM"}
