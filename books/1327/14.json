PANIC-STRICKEN","content":"\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Is this reason? \u0026nbsp;Is this humanity? \u0026nbsp;Alas! it is man. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning Jack Meredith was awakened by his servant Joseph before it was fully light. It would appear as if Joseph had taken no means of awakening him, for Meredith awoke quite quietly to find Joseph standing by his bed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Holloa!” exclaimed the master, fully awake at once, as townsmen are.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joseph stood at attention by the bedside.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Woke you before yer time, sir,” he said. “There\u0027s something wrong among these \u0027ere darkie fellers, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wrong! what do you mean?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meredith was already lacing his shoes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not rebellion?” he said curtly, looking towards his firearms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir, not that. It\u0027s some mortual sickness. I don\u0027t know what it is. I\u0027ve been up half the night with them. It\u0027s spreading, too.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sickness! what does it seem like? Just give me that jacket. Not that sleeping sickness?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir. It\u0027s not that. Missis Marie was telling me about that—awful scourge that, sir. No, the poor chaps are wide-awake enough. Groanin\u0027, and off their heads too, mostly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you called Mr. Oscard?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Call him and Mr. Durnovo.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Met Mr. Durnovo, sir, goin\u0027 out as I came in.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a few moments Jack joined Durnovo and Oscard, who were talking together on the terrace in front of the house. Guy Oscard was still in his pyjamas, which he had tucked into top-boots. He also wore a sun-helmet, which added a finish to his costume. They got quite accustomed to this get-up during the next three days, for he never had time to change it; and, somehow, it ceased to be humorous long before the end of that time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, it\u0027s nothing,” Durnovo was saying, with a singular eagerness. “I know these chaps. They have been paid in advance. They are probably shamming, and if they are not they are only suffering from the effects of a farewell glorification. They want to delay our start. That is their little game. It will give them a better chance of deserting.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At any rate, we had better go and see them,” suggested Jack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, don\u0027t!” cried Durnovo eagerly, detaining him with both hands. “Take my advice, and don\u0027t. Just have breakfast in the ordinary way and pretend there is nothing wrong. Then afterwards you can lounge casually into the camp.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right,” said Jack, rather unwillingly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It has been of some use—this scare,” said Durnovo, turning and looking towards the river. “It has reminded me of something. We have not nearly enough quinine. I will just take a quick canoe, and run down to Loango to fetch some.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He turned quite away from them, and stooped to attach the lace of his boot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can travel night and day, and be back here in three days,” he added. “In the meantime you can be getting on with the loading of the canoes, and we will start as soon as I get back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood upright and looked around with weatherwise, furtive eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Seems to me,” he said, “there\u0027s thunder coming. I think I had better be off at once.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the course of his inspection of the lowering clouds which hung, black as ink, just above the trees, his eyes lighted on Joseph, standing within the door of the cottage, watching him with a singular half-suppressed smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” he said hurriedly, “I will start at once. I can eat some sort of a breakfast when we are under way.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked beneath his lashes quickly from Jack to Guy and back again. Their silent acquiescence was not quite satisfactory. Then he called his own men, and spoke to them in a tongue unknown to the Englishmen. He hurried forward their preparations with a feverish irritability which made Jack Meredith think of the first time he had ever seen Durnovo—a few miles farther down the river—all palpitating and trembling with climatic nervousness. His face was quite yellow, and there was a line drawn diagonally from the nostrils down each cheek, to lose itself ultimately in the heavy black moustache.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before he stepped into his canoe the thunder was rumbling in the distance, and the air was still as death. Breathing was an effort; the inhaled air did not satisfy the lungs, and seemed powerless to expand them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Overhead the clouds, of a blue-black intensity, seemed almost to touch the trees; the river was of ink. The rowers said nothing, but they lingered on the bank and watched Durnovo\u0027s face anxiously. When he took his seat in the canoe they looked protestingly up to the sky. Durnovo said something to them rapidly, and they laid their paddles to the water.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Scarcely had the boat disappeared in the bend of the river before the rain broke. It came with the rush of an express train—the trees bending before the squall like reeds. The face of the river was tormented into a white fury by the drops which splashed up again a foot in height. The lashing of the water on the bare backs of the negroes was distinctly audible to Victor Durnovo.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the black clouds split up like a rent cloth, and showed behind them, not Heaven, but the living fire of Hell. The thunder crashed out in sharp reports like file-firing at a review. With one accord the men ceased rowing and crouched down in the canoe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Durnovo shouted to them, his face livid with fury. But for some moments his voice was quite lost. The lightning ran over the face of the river like will-o\u0027-the-wisps; the whole heaven was streaked continuously with it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly the negroes leaped to their paddles and rowed with bent back, and wild staring eyes, as if possessed. They were covered by the muzzle of Durnovo\u0027s revolver.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Behind the evil-looking barrel of blue steel, the half-caste\u0027s dripping face looked forth, peering into the terrific storm. There was no question of fending off such torrents of rain, nor did he attempt it. Indeed, he seemed to court its downfall. He held out his arms and stretched forth his legs, giving free play to the water which ran off him in a continual stream, washing his thin khaki clothing on his limbs. He raised his face to the sky, and let the water beat upon his brow and hair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The roar of the thunder, which could be FELT, so great was the vibration of the laden air, seemed to have no fear for him. The lightning, ever shooting athwart the sky, made him blink as if dazzled, but he looked upon it without emotion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He knew that behind him he had left a greater danger than this, and he stretched out his limbs to the cleansing torrent with an exulting relief to be washed from the dread infection. Small-pox had laid its hand on the camp at Msala: and from the curse of it Victor Durnovo was flying in a mad chattering panic through all the anger of the tropic elements, holding death over his half-stunned crew, not daring to look behind him or pause in his coward\u0027s flight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is still said on the Ogowe river that no man travels like Victor Durnovo. Certain it is that, in twenty-seven hours from the time that he left Msala on the morning of the great storm, he presented himself before Maurice Gordon in his office at the factory at Loango.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!” cried Gordon, hardly noticing the washed-out, harassed appearance of the visitor; “here you are again. I heard that the great expedition had started.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So it has, but I have come back to get one or two things we have forgotten. Got any sherry handy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course,” replied Gordon, with perfect adhesion to the truth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He laid aside his pen and, turning in his chair, drew a decanter from a small cupboard which stood on the ground at his side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here you are,” he continued, pouring out a full glass with practised, but slightly unsteady, hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Durnovo drank the wine at one gulp and set the glass down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!” he said, “that does a chap good.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Does it now?” exclaimed Maurice Gordon with mock surprise. “Well, I\u0027ll just try.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The manner in which he emptied his glass was quite different, with a long, slow drawing-out of the enjoyment, full of significance for the initiated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you be at home to-night?” asked Durnovo, gently pushing aside the hospitable decanter. “I have got a lot of work to do to-day, but I should like to run in and see you this evening.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, come and dine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Durnovo shook his head and looked down at his wrinkled and draggled clothing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I can\u0027t do that, old man. Not in this trim.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Bosh? What matter? Jocelyn doesn\u0027t mind.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, but I do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was obvious that he wanted to accept the invitation, although the objection he raised was probably honest. For that taint in the blood that cometh from the subtle tar-brush brings with it a vanity that has its equal in no white man\u0027s heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I\u0027ll lend you a black coat! Seven o\u0027clock sharp!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Durnovo hurried away with a gleam of excitement in his dark eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Maurice Gordon did not resume his work at once. He sat for some time idly drumming with his fingers on the desk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I can only get her to be civil to him,” he reflected aloud, “I\u0027ll get into this business yet.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At seven o\u0027clock Durnovo appeared at the Gordons\u0027 house. He had managed to borrow a dress-suit, and wore an orchid in his buttonhole. It was probably the first time that Jocelyn had seen him in this garb of civilisation, which is at the same time the most becoming and the most trying variety of costume left to sensible men in these days. A dress-suit finds a man out sooner than anything except speech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jocelyn was civil in her reception—more so, indeed, than Maurice Gordon had hoped for. She seemed almost glad to see Durnovo, and evinced quite a kindly interest in his movements. Durnovo attributed this to the dress-suit, while Maurice concluded that his obvious hints, thrown out before dinner, had fallen on fruitful ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At dinner Victor Durnovo was quite charmed with the interest that Jocelyn took in the expedition, of which, he gave it to be understood, he was the chief. So also was Maurice, because Durnovo\u0027s evident admiration of Jocelyn somewhat overcame his natural secrecy of character.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027ll hear of me, Miss Gordon, never fear, before three months are past,” said Durnovo, in reply to a vague suggestion that his absence might extend to several months. “I am not the sort of man to come to grief by a foolish mistake or any unnecessary risk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To which sentiment two men at Msala bore generous testimony later on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The simple dinner was almost at an end, and it was at this time that Jocelyn Gordon began once more to dislike Durnovo. At first she had felt drawn towards him. Although he wore the dress-clothes rather awkwardly, there was something in his manner which reminded her vaguely of a gentleman. It was not that he was exactly gentlemanly, but there was the reflection of good breeding in his bearing. Dark-skinned people, be it noted, have usually the imitative faculty. As the dinner and the wine warmed his heart, so by degrees he drew on his old self like a glove. He grew bolder and less guarded. His opinion of himself rose momentarily, and with it a certain gleam in his eyes increased as they rested on Jocelyn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not long before she noted this, and quite suddenly her ancient dislike of the man was up in arms with a new intensity gathered she knew not whence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And,” said Maurice, when Jocelyn had left them, “I suppose you\u0027ll be a millionaire in about six months?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He gently pushed the wine towards him at the same time. Durnovo had not slept for forty hours. The excitement of his escape from the plague-ridden camp had scarcely subsided. The glitter of the silver on the table, the shaded candles, the subtle sensuality of refinement and daintiness appealed to his hot-blooded nature. He was a little off his feet perhaps. He took the decanter and put it to the worst use he could have selected.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not so soon as that,” he said; “but in time—in time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lucky beggar!” muttered Maurice Gordon, with a little sigh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t mind telling you,” said Durnovo, with a sudden confidence begotten of Madeira, “that it\u0027s Simiacine—that\u0027s what it is. I can\u0027t tell you more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Simiacine,” repeated Gordon, fingering the stem of his wine-glass and looking at him keenly between the candle-shades. “Yes. You\u0027ve always been on its track, haven\u0027t you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In six months your go-downs will be full of it—my Simiacine, my Simiacine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By God, I wish I had a hand in it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Maurice Gordon pushed the decanter again—gently, almost surreptitiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And so you may, some day. You help me and I\u0027ll help you—that is my ticket. Reciprocity—reciprocity, my dear Maurice.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, but how?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can\u0027t tell you now, but I will in good time—in my own time. Come, let\u0027s join the ladies—eh? haha!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But at this moment the servant brought in coffee, saying in his master\u0027s ear that Miss Jocelyn had gone to bed with a slight headache.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2775/76803.html","bookId":1327,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:51:20 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:51:20 AM"}
