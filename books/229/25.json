{"id":7074,"no":25,"title":"The Thirteenth Tuesday We Talk About the Perfect Day","content":"\u003cp\u003eMorrie wanted to be cremated. He had discussed it with Charlotte, and they decided it was the best way. The rabbi from Brandeis, Al Axelrad-a longtime friend whom they chose to conduct the funeral service-had come to visit Morrie, and Morrie told him of his cremation plans.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And Al?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure they don\u0027t overcook me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe rabbi was stunned. But Morrie was able to joke about his body now. The closer he got to the end, the more he saw it as a mere shell, a container of the soul. It was withering to useless skin and bones anyhow, which made it easier to let go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We are so afraid of the sight of death,\" Morrie told me when I sat down. I adjusted the microphone on his collar, but it kept flopping over. Morrie coughed. He was coughing all the time now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I read a book the other day. It said as soon as someone dies in a hospital, they pull the sheets up over their head, and they wheel the body to some chute and push it down. They can\u0027t wait to get it out of their sight. People act as if death is contagious.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI fumbled with the microphone. Morrie glanced at my hands.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not contagious, you know. Death is as natural as life. It\u0027s part of the deal we made.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe coughed again, and I moved back and waited, always braced for something serious. Morrie had been having bad nights lately. Frightening nights. He could sleep only a few hours at a time before violent hacking spells woke him. The nurses would come into the bedroom, pound him on the back, try to bring up the poison. Even if they got him breathing normally again-\"normally\" meaning with the help of the oxygen machine--the fight left him fatigued the whole next day.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe oxygen tube was up his nose now. I hated the sight of it. To me, it symbolized helplessness. I wanted to pull it out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night . . .\" Morrie said softly. Yes? Last night?\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened. \"Mitch, it was a most incredible feeling. The sensation of accepting what was happening, being at peace. I was thinking about a dream I had last week, where I was crossing a bridge into something unknown. Being ready to move on to whatever is next.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut you didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie waited a moment. He shook his head slightly. \"No, I didn\u0027t. But I felt that I could. Do you understand?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we\u0027re all looking for. A certain peace with the idea of dying. If we know, in the end, that we can ultimately have that peace with dying, then we can finally do the really hard thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhich is?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Make peace with living.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe asked to see the hibiscus plant on the ledge behind him. I cupped it in my hand and held it up near his eyes. He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s natural to die,\" he said again. \"The fact that we make such a big hullabaloo over it is all because we don\u0027t see ourselves as part of nature. We think because we\u0027re human we\u0027re something above nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at the plant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not. Everything that gets born, dies.\" He looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you accept that?\" Yes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he whispered, \"now here\u0027s the payoff. Here is how we are different from these wonderful plants and animals.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on-in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was raspy, which usually meant he needed to stop for a while. I placed the plant back on the ledge and went to shut off the tape recorder. This is the last sentence Morrie got out before I did:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Death ends a life, not a relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for me,\" Morrie said, dismissing it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn all the time he was sick, Morrie never held out hope he would be cured. He was realistic to a fault. One time, I asked if someone were to wave a magic wand and make him all better, would he become, in time, the man he had been before?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No way I could go back. I am a different self now. I\u0027m different in my attitudes. I\u0027m different appreciating my body, which I didn\u0027t do fully before. I\u0027m different in terms of trying to grapple with the big questions, the ultimate questions, the ones that won\u0027t go away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the thing, you see. Once you get your fingers on the important questions, you can\u0027t turn away from them.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd which are the important questions?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"As I see it, they have to do with love, responsibility, spirituality, awareness. And if I were healthy today, those would still be my issues. They should have been all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI tried to imagine Morrie healthy. I tried to imagine him pulling the covers from his body, stepping from that chair, the two of us going for a walk around the neighborhood, the way we used to walk around campus. I suddenly realized it had been sixteen years since I\u0027d seen him standing up. Sixteen years?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat if you had one day perfectly healthy, I asked? What would you do?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-four hours?\" Twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see . . . I\u0027d get up in the morning, do my exercises, have a lovely breakfast of sweet rolls and tea, go for a swim, then have my friends come over for a nice lunch. I\u0027d have them come one or two at a time so we could talk about their families, their issues, talk about how much we mean to each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027d like to go for a walk, in a garden with some trees, watch their colors, watch the birds, take in the nature that I haven\u0027t seen in so long now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In the evening, we\u0027d all go together to a restaurant with some great pasta, maybe some duck-I love duckand then we\u0027d dance the rest of the night. I\u0027d dance with all the wonderful dance partners out there, until I was exhausted. And then I\u0027d go home and have a deep, wonderful sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was so simple. So average. I was actually a little disappointed. I figured he\u0027d fly to Italy or have lunch with the President or romp on the seashore or try every exotic thing he could think of. After all these months, lying there, unable to move a leg or a foot-how could he find perfection in such an average day?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen I realized this was the whole point.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI felt a shiver. I do not know how Morrie knew this was on my mind. I had been trying to call my brother in Spain for weeks, and had learned-from a friend of histhat he was flying back and forth to a hospital in Amsterdam.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch, I know it hurts when you can\u0027t be with someone you love. But you need to be at peace with his desires. Maybe he doesn\u0027t want you interrupting your life. Maybe he can\u0027t deal with that burden. I tell everyone I know to carry on with the life they know-don\u0027t ruin it because I am dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027s my brother, I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Morrie said. \"That\u0027s why it hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI saw Peter in my mind when he was eight years old, his curly blond hair puffed into a sweaty ball atop his head. I saw us wrestling in the yard next to our house, the grass stains soaking through the knees of our jeans. I saw him singing songs in front of the mirror, holding a brush as a microphone, and I saw us squeezing into the attic where we hid together as children, testing our parents\u0027 will to find us for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I saw him as the adult who had drifted away, thin and frail, his face bony from the chemotherapy treatments.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie, I said. Why doesn\u0027t he want to see me?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy old professor sighed. \"There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In business, people negotiate to win. They negotiate to get what they want. Maybe you\u0027re too used to that. Love is different. Love is when you are as concerned about someone else\u0027s situation as you are about your own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had these special times with your brother, and you no longer have what you had with him. You want them back. You never want them to stop. But that\u0027s part of being human. Stop, renew, stop, renew.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him. I saw all the death in the world. I felt helpless.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll find a way back to your brother,\" Morrie said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow do you know?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie smiled. \"You found me, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. The story is about a little wave, bobbing along in the ocean, having a grand old time. He\u0027s enjoying the wind and the fresh air-until he notices the other waves in front of him, crashing against the shore.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\" `My God, this is terrible,\u0027 the wave says. `Look what\u0027s going to happen to me!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave, looking grim, and it says to him, `Why do you look so sad?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The first wave says,\u0026nbsp;`You don\u0027t understand! We\u0027re all going to crash! All of us waves are going to be nothing! Isn\u0027t it terrible?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The second wave says, `No, you don\u0027t understand. You\u0027re not a wave, you\u0027re part of the ocean.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI smile. Morrie closes his eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of the ocean, \" he says, \"part of the ocean. \" I watch him breathe, in and out, in and out.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2476.html","bookId":229,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:49 AM"}
