How Kriemhild thought on Vengeance for her Wrongs","content":"\u0026nbsp;Amid all this honour and glory—herein doth the bard sing true— \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dwelt they in love together till the seventh year onward drew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the midst of the years unto Kriemhild was born a noble son.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the life of Etzel never had a brighter dayspring shone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never she ceased from pleading till she won her love’s reward\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That unto the font baptismal of the faith of Christ the Lord\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Brought was the child of Etzel, and Ortlieb they named the boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then all King Etzel’s kingdom rejoiced with exceeding joy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the selfsame paths of virtue that Helka had trodden erst\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The feet of the Lady Kriemhild paced day by day from the first;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By Herrat, the stranger princess, in the ways of the land were they set,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While her secret heart for Helka bore a burden of long regret.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The son of the land and the stranger with one accord confessed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That never had any kingdom of any king possessed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n More bounteous queen and gracious: true witness they held it of her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such was her praise mid the Hunfolk still till the thirteenth year.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now when she marked how no man opposed him to her will—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even so unto wives of princes knights wont to bear them still—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And that twelve kings stood in her presence aye as the years passed on,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the pain and the wrong she brooded that was dealt to her years agone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She thought withal on the honour that of yore in the Niblung land\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of right unto her was rendered, whereof had Hagen’s hand\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Utterly despoiled her when Siegfried by him had been slain:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she pondered how she might compass that his wrong should become his bane:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 190}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Into this land could I but bring him, then might my vengeance betide!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She dreamed a dream, how that walking anear her, close at her side,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Was Giselher her brother, and she kissed him again and again\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In slumber—what meant that vision was thereafter all too plain!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Foul Fiend was it surely that whispered Kriemhild’s heart\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In outward-seeming friendship from Gunther the King to part,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with kiss of feigned forgiveness, in Burgundia years ago.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the old pain woke, and her vesture was drenched with the hot tears’ flow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On her heart lay morning by morning, and evening by evening lay\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The thought, how they had constrained her the faith of her youth to betray\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By taking to husband a heathen, when will thereto she had none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This wrong unto her had Hagen and her brother Gunther done.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How she might wreak her vengeance still thought she day by day:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now am I waxen so mighty, I have such far-reaching sway,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I of them that have wronged me could exact the penalty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gladly with Hagen of Troneg would I deal as he dealt with me!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For my belovèd mourneth my spirit within me still.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Might I but draw them hither which have worked me all this ill,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, then might I have vengeance at last for my Siegfried’s death.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Scarce can I endure this waiting!” she moaned with passionate breath.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well was she loved of all men of Etzel’s vassal-array\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which were named the Knights of Kriemhild: good cause in sooth had they.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Friends many were won by Eckwart her treasurer’s open hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The will of the Lady Kriemhild might none in the realm withstand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Each day was she thinking, thinking: “I will make my request to the King\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If so of his grace and his goodness he may haply grant this thing\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That my friends be bidden to see me here in the Land of the Hun.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the guileful purpose of Kriemhild the while was divined of none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One night, when the Lady Kriemhild beside King Etzel lay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he held her in arms enfolding, even as his wont was aye\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 191}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In his love for the noble lady who was dear as his life unto him,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then on her enemies thought she, and her thoughts were guileful and grim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She spake unto King Etzel: “My dearly-belovèd Lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I would make unto thee my petition, if this thy grace would accord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou suffer mine heart to be gladdened, if my love hath deserved this meed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the proof of mine eyes that my kinsmen be dear unto thee indeed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake the King, and, speaking, was guileless his heart within:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hereof will I certify thee: whatsoe’er to thine hero-kin\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Is done for their honour and profit, for mine own joy shall it be done;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For never by love of woman nobler kin have I won.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto him the Queen made answer: “Well known is this unto thee,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That indeed I have high-born kinsmen; but sorely it troubleth me\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That, since I wedded thee, never their faces have I seen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In sooth, of all thy people am I known for ‘the Kinless Queen’!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer and spake King Etzel: “O wife, heart’s dearest mine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If not too great be the journey, I will bid them over Rhine\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hither to this my kingdom, the friends thou art fain to see.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then for the word that spake him her ally glad was she.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If thou, my lord,” she made answer, “thy kindness to me wilt show,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Worms, to the city of Rhineland, forth let thy messengers go;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So will I send mine heart’s wish to the friends in the far-away home;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so knights noble and gentle full many to us shall come.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He answered: “If this thou askest, thereto hast thou my consent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thyself in the sight of thy kinsmen shall be never so well content\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As I, in beholding the faces of noble Uta’s sons.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I grieve that these have been strangers so long from the land of the Huns.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My wife, my well-belovèd, if this be thy pleasure,” he said,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As messengers unto thy kinsmen straightway of me shall be sped\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Burgundy-land our minstrels, the lords of the viol-string.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Into his presence the minstrels he bade them straightway bring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then came the King’s two servants to the presence of their lord\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Where he sat by the Queen, and Etzel delivered to them his word\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 192}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That he would they should be his heralds unto far Burgundia-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for their arraying in vesture right goodly he gave command.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For good knights four-and-twenty were provided mantle and vest;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For to these withal with the minstrels was given the King’s behest,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even to bear his bidding unto Gunther and his men.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the Lady Kriemhild set her to commune with them privily then.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Said the mighty King: “Now hearken, that mine hest ye may so fulfil:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I send unto those our kinsmen all love and all good will,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And I pray them to ride to my country unto them that love them here.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never in all my life-days guests have I known so dear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And if these peradventure be minded to grant the thing that I pray,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even the kinsmen of Kriemhild, I beseech them not to delay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But to come in the summer season of this year unto my feast:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So by these my marriage-kinsmen shall the joy of my life be increased.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer the viol-minstrel, and Schwemmel the knightly replied:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When, O my Lord, in the Hunland shall fall thy festal tide,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the end that unto thy kinsmen by Rhine we may certainly say?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer and spake King Etzel, “On next Midsummer Day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We will do after thy commandment,” straight Werbel made reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Kriemhild caused the heralds to be summoned secretly\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto the closet royal, and there she communed with the twain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereof unto many a good knight was begotten ruinous bane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She spake in her guile to the heralds: “Ye shall earn of me rich meed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If ye keep in your hearts my counsel, and perform it with diligent heed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And speak in mine ancient home-land the word of my desire;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then rich in goods will I make you, and give to you royal attire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When at Worms beside Rhine-river your messenger feet shall be brought\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the presence of those my kinsfolk, see ye confess this not\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That here ye have ever beheld me in grief as of widowhood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And bear ye my love-greeting to the heroes valiant and good,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And pray them to grant this favour, even my lord’s request,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thereby to bring me riddance from the constant grief of my breast,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 193}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even this, that I seem ‘the Kinless’ here in the Hunfolk’s sight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For me, full oft to the Rhineland would I come, were I but a knight!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Gernot withal my brother, the noble prince, say ye\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That none unto him more loving than I on earth can be;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And pray that he bring with him hither all our noblest kin\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To greet us here in the Hunland: high honour so shall we win.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to Giselher’s remembrance withal be this thing brought,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That never through him to Kriemhild hath wrong or despite been wrought:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Him therefore here in the Hunland gladly mine eyes would see;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, sorely I long to greet him for his love and his faith unto me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What glory here hath crowned me do ye to my mother say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And, if haply Hagen of Troneg would fain hang back from the way,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who then through those strange marches shall be guide to the mighty ones?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For hath not he known from childhood the paths to the land of the Huns?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the messengers knew not wherefore so fixed it was in her mind\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That they should not suffer Hagen of Troneg to tarry behind\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Beside the Rhine. To their sorrow were they to learn it yet,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When with grim death many a hero face to face should be set.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto these were messages given and tokens from Etzel’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With wealth enriched they journeyed: they might bear them as lords of the land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair leave of their liege-lord Etzel and his comely wife took they,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they went forth splendour-vestured in royal-rich array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90350.html","bookId":422,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}
