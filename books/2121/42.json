Then slowly it began to vanish, the metallic tinge turned white and invisible as the cold night air hit the liquid. Vampire blood...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss stared at her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t remember. She had blacked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memories began to flood back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw herself get inside the car with her parents, saw them nod at her. They were expecting her to accompany them. How strange. It was like being in a movie. She could see out of her eyes, but she could not move her arms or legs or even speak. Someone else was doing that for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else was inside her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in the white suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am you. You are me. We are one, my daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrived at a hilltop mansion, and Bliss remembered hiding in the shadows until the time came. She had watched the killing unfold with an overwhelming sense of horror. The massacre she had inflicted with her own hands. She had been imprisoned in her own body, a helpless figure, trapped inside her head while the other took over. Inside she had raged and wept and screamed. But she was powerless, with absolutely no ability to stop herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she began to remember what happened during her blackouts. Began to realize the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was the one who had attacked Dylan that first night at The Bank. She had wanted to drain him, but something - a vestigial attraction to him - had stopped her, so she had taken Aggie instead. She had attempted to take Schuyler twice. That was why Schuyler\u0027s bloodhound had barked at her - Beauty knew her true nature even if Schuyler did not. Then she had attacked Cordelia, had almost taken her, if Dylan had not stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan had been a problem. He knew but did not know. That was why his memory was so screwed up all the time. He knew the truth even though she\u0027d tried to wipe it from his consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat first time he had returned to warn her about the Silver Bloods had resulted in that bloody scene in the bathroom. She remembered his blood-soaked leather jacket, the scratches on her face and the bruise on her neck. But he had escaped, and she\u0027d had to send others to track him down. But the Venators got to him first. Oliver was wrong. They were not Silver Bloods. They had let Dylan go when they discovered he was innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was free to return to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stupid, stupid boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who the Silver Blood is,\" Dylan had said that night he crashed through the window. \"It\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right then and there, she had changed his memory. Made him think it was Schuyler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small, sad voice inside her began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved him. I loved Dylan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe love no one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one but ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForsyth had known all along. That\u0027s why she could never bring herself to ask him about Dylan, because somewhere in her subconscious she knew the reason why her father was keeping things from her. Because part of her could not accept who she really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as she left the burning house, taking a car that had a body stuffed in the trunk. Dylan. She had taken him to the mountaintop, where Lawrence and Schuyler were waiting. Taken him to Corcovado, where he would be a sacrifice. There, she had shaped him in his image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had brought him to his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lawrence\u0027s blade that struck, but it was she who had killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she had killed so many others. She heard the voices of everyone she had taken. They were all there, inside her head, screaming, crying. SILENCE! Nan Cutler was part of it, she realized. Nan was the Warden who had checked for the Mark of Lucifer on her neck. She\u0027d been the one who had cleared Bliss of suspicion during the investigation. Bliss suddenly had an idea, and lifted her hair from her neck and touched her fingers to her skin. She felt it at once. She turned to the mirror and saw it. A small star-shaped scar that branded her as the devil\u0027s own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? the small, sad voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that the one who calls herself \"Bliss.\" Is she still there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, said the same tiny voice. It was the voice of Bliss Llewellyn. The same voice of Maggie Stanford before her. It was always the same way. Every cycle. They never wanted to accept the truth of their heritage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not want this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour desires are immaterial. Now pick yourself up and walk toward your friends. Not everything went to plan. Some of us were killed. We must bide our time again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know who you are now, \"Bliss\" said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are Lucifer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightbringer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorningstar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe former Prince of Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer true and immortal father. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-42.html","bookId":2121,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
