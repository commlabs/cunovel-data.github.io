We\u0027d been following a twisting road which led along one exposed edge of a high mountain valley when I spotted an empty car park. Emma didn\u0027t want to drive. We decided to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked the car, stopped the engine and got out. A stupid thing to do, perhaps, but it didn\u0027t seem to matter anymore. If any bodies were near by (and I couldn\u0027t see any) then what could they do to us? What could they take from us? We had nothing and we could lock ourselves into the Landrover if we needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in a beautiful place, and for a short time nothing seemed to matter. The moon was high and proud in the sky and the night was still. Across the valley a steep, jagged mountain-face climbed away from us. It was as remote and inhospitable a place as we could have hoped to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You all right?\u0027 Emma asked as she walked round to stand next to me. I nodded and instinctively pulled her close. The warmth of her body was comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Want to keep going?\u0027 she asked me suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I answered truthfully. \u0027Do you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is there any point?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s got to be somewhere we can go,\u0027 I said. \u0027Somewhere they can\u0027t get to. Another Penn Farm...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down into her face and stopped talking. She was half-smiling, and her expression seemed to be telling me that although she really did want to believe me, she didn\u0027t. Tears of pain and frustration began to roll down her delicate cheeks from her tired eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn silence we clambered into the back of the Landrover together and lay there on the floor, holding each other tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll be okay,\u0027 I heard myself say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled briefly and then buried her head in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had nothing left to lose but our lives. We lay there in the darkness and waited for morning. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-48.html","bookId":2557,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM"}
