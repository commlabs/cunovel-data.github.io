After which, while being stared at by countless onlookers, a light was glimmering in the distance before eight figures appeared in the sky. Leading this group, was a man dressed in green clothes. His looks were fairly ordinary, but the arrogance that covered his face left a deep impression on anyone who saw him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, this green clothed man’s hands were crossed over his chest. He wore a look of contempt as he stared at the distant Luo Tong.

Following which, he saw a familiar figure behind that green clothed man. It was actually Duan Tao.

He did not see that person when he was at the Dragon tribe. However, the aura radiating from the latter caused him to be stunned. In fact, he had already surpassed an ordinary Samsara stage expert and vaguely touched Reincarnation. Nonetheless, he was still a little lacking compared to first elder Zhu Li from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, and first elder Mu Di from the Nine Phoenix tribe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter Lin Dong’s Mental Energy cultivation advanced to the Symbol Grandmaster level, he was officially considered as part of the global elite. However, those within the Samsara stage were also ranked accordingly. Moreover, the ranking system was fairly unique and it was not determined by the strength of one’s Yuan Power. Instead, it was determined by who had a deeper understanding of Reincarnation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnce one was able to comprehend Reincarnation, one would be considered as an expert who has touched Reincarnation.

However, those individuals like first elder Zhu Li and Mu Di had already touched Reincarnation. Therefore, though these two groups were technically on the same cultivation level, there was a huge difference in their strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, that green clothed man had clearly reached the stage, whereby he had made contact with Reincarnation. However, his understanding of Reincarnation was a little weaker compared to old demons like Zhu Li and Mu Di. Nonetheless, an ordinary Samsara stage expert was definitely no match for him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That is Liu Qing from the Dragon tribe… An extremely powerful person. It is rumoured that he is crazy about training and he is also the youngest person in the Dragon tribe’s Elders Council. Additionally, he personally received pointers from Qing Zhi before. Therefore… he also practises the Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill.” It seems like Little Marten was quite familiar with that person as he replied Lin Dong.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Oh? He has also learnt the Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill?” Lin Dong was slightly startled. Promptly, his interest was piqued. Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill was considered as a top-tier martial arts of the Dragon tribe. However, other than Qing Zhi, he had yet to meet anyone else who practised it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Hey, regardless, Lin Dong is the Punishment Elder of our Dragon tribe. Are you trying to humiliate our Dragon tribe by speaking of him in this manner?” Liu Qing was hovering in the sky with his hands crossed over his chest, before he chuckled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLuo Tong had a somewhat ugly expression. However, he did not dare to retort owing to Liu Qing’s fearsome reputation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Oh? It is actually that little brat Liu Qing from the Dragon tribe. This old man has always been a straight shooter. In fact, even if your tribe leader is here, I will still say what I want to.” Mu Di frowned and said after he saw Liu Qing butting in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Blah, old fellow, you should stop trying to use your age to put me down. I would very much prefer to talk directly using our fists rather than seniority.” The corner of Liu Qing’s mouth was curled and his tone was extremely impolite. Although he was indeed ranked a little lower than Mu Di in terms of seniority, he was extremely powerful. If they were to exchange blows, it was likely that he had no need to fear this first elder of the Nine Phoenix tribe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Humph, ignorant and arrogant fool.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMu Di’s expression darkened before the space around him gradually became contorted. After which, a faint and mysterious ripple spread. That ripple might be extremely faint, but countless individuals felt an extremely powerful pressure radiating from it. That pressure had the taste of Reincarnation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Little fellow, though you touched Reincarnation within merely a hundred years, I’m afraid it’s still too early for you to act arrogantly in front of me!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, old fellow, if you feel upset, you can take a swing at me with your fists. Then, you’ll find out if I am qualified to act this haughtily!” Liu Qing was not the least bit fearful when he saw an enraged Mu Di. Instead, it seems like he was eager to fight as his laughter resounded across the place.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eStanding on a mountaintop, Lin Dong chuckled when he heard this.

Just as he was about to lose control and attack Liu Qing to teach him a lesson, an elderly laughter suddenly resounded across the sky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, it seems like this place is really lively.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe space became distorted when the laughter sounded.

I didn’t even utter a single word before the other party came knocking on my door.” Lin Dong spread his hands in an innocent manner. The Nine Phoenix tribe was the party who came looking for trouble today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Moreover, first elder, the reason why all of you hurried over… Is it because you guys are interested in the Devouring Divine Palace?” Lin Dong glanced at first elder Zhu Li and asked. However, he intentionally said the second sentence with a softer voice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I am aware that you own the Devouring Ancestral Symbol.” First elder Zhu Li looked at Lin Dong with a deeper meaning in his eyes, before he said, “You are the one with the highest potential to obtain the inheritance of the Devouring Master. The main reason why tribe leader sent me here is to assist you. Although you have advanced to the initial Symbol Grandmaster level, there are many powerful hidden individuals in the Demon Region. Hence, it’ll likely be no easy task for you to obtain the inheritance with your current strength.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“In that case, please help me to convey my thanks to the tribe leader.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong laughed and he felt some gratitude in his heart. The Devouring Master’s inheritance was extremely tempting. Yet, the Celestial Demon Marten tribe actually chose to assist him. This was indeed a huge favour.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, brother Lin Dong, how have you been.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnother familiar laughter was transmitted over while Lin Dong was chatting with first elder Zhu Li. Lin Dong turned his head before he saw the group of Dragon tribe experts walking towards him. The person laughing heartily was Duan Tao.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong cupped his hands towards Duan Tao and smiled. Then, he rotated his eyes and paused on Liu Qing, who was currently staring at him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Heh, are you that Lin Dong who caught the eye of Lord Qing Zhi?” The pride on Liu Qing’s face did not diminish as he smilingly looked at Lin Dong. Instead, his eyes were filled with some heat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Yes, I am.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Liu Qing’s face was plastered with arrogance, he did not hold any ill-intent towards Lin Dong. Hence, Lin Dong smiled and replied.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLiu Qing laughed out loud. A moment later, he took a step forward. Immediately, green light surged around him before an earth-shaking dragon roar sounded. After which, thousands of green dragon light tattoos rose. The aura caused many huge cracks to appear on the mountain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Heaven Dragon Demon Commander, Little Flame and the rest were all startled upon seeing this. They were just about to stand in front of Lin Dong, when the latter waved his hand to stop them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Since big brother Liu Qing wants to test my Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill, I will likely cause senior Qing Zhi to throw his face if I refuse.

Promptly, he clenched both his hands before purple-gold dragon light tattoos surged out from within his body. An ancient and pure dragon pressure, which resembled that of a huge dragon, slowly awakened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1159\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1161\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1160","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM"}
