My back was on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, twisting awkwardly, trying to see in the mirror above the sink. The long, furrowed mark pulsed bright red, as if infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scar had never bothered me once it healed. Sometimes I even forgot for an hour or two at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the matter now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened, rubbed my hand over my face, and looked again. The scar was just a scar. Puckered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite. Healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was losing my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw on some clothes, retrieved my weapons, and left the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remnants of the nightmare faded as I drove into Crow Valley. It wasn\u0027t as if I\u0027d never had one before. I\u0027d just never had one in the daytime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich disturbed me. I\u0027d been able to keep the nightmares at bay by sleeping when the sun shone. If that re-lief was gone to me, would I ever be able to sleep again? I didn\u0027t want to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I didn\u0027t. I\u0027d become very good at pushing aside anything I didn\u0027t want to dwell on. If I hadn\u0027t been, I doubt I\u0027d be functional at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow Valley was as busy in the light of an October afternoon as it was empty of an October midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolk of every age, shape, and color walked up and down the picturesque streets. Some even waved as if they knew me. They probably did. In small towns gossip traveled at the speed of sound. One of the reasons I didn\u0027t stay long in any one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove to Jessie\u0027s apartment. It was nearly five o\u0027clock. I\u0027d slept, and dreamed, the day away. But since she didn\u0027t go on duty until the sun went down, we still had time to do our job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie opened the door before I even knocked, and shoved the fax into my hand. \"About time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up your ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned on me, and I blocked her punch with my forearm. She might have slammed me against the wall once, but that didn\u0027t mean I\u0027d let her do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in no mood to play nice,\" I warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitch, bitch, bitch.\" She stalked away, plopping onto the couch with a scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" I tried a more pleasant version of the same question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at me. \"Will\u0027s not back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you call him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cell phone\u0027s off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he forget to turn it on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every damn day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you worried about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see - werewolves, vampires, zombies, witches, and all sorts of other things I don\u0027t even know about. Then there are car accidents, mass murderers, blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, and various acts of God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"Gee, how do you sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he\u0027s not here, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I looked closer, there were dark circles under her eyes; lines of stress bracketed her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was really worried, and I couldn\u0027t say that I blamed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you call any friendly state cops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m a fool? Of course I called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was exactly what I\u0027d been talking about when I said attachments were a bad thing. Jessie wasn\u0027t thinking of werewolves and serial killers; she was thinking of Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If anything had happened, they\u0027d know about it, Jessie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea. But if I gave voice to any of my thoughts, she\u0027d only try to slug me again, so I glanced at the sheet of paper in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open Serial Killer Cases Where Cannibalism Is Suspected.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What a lovely title. There were only two. Herman Reyes and some guy named Louis-Francois Charone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said Hector was on here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check out the place where they last saw Herman Reyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. Topeka - in the year my life ended. Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my gaze. \"Then Hector is Herman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie held out a photo. Dizziness rushed over me in a nauseating wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuerida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word whispered through the room. I swayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Suddenly Jessie was there, catching me around the waist and holding me up. \"I guess I don\u0027t have to ask if that\u0027s him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" She yanked out one of the dining room chairs. \"Sit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. She shoved my head between my knees, none too gently. \"Now breathe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated taking orders, especially from her. But I hated fainting even more, so I breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glass of water appeared between my feet. I sat up and sipped. Jessie leaned against the table reading the rest of the faxed report. She lifted her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for her to ask if I was OK, if I needed to lie down, take a pill, see a doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess he changed his name,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to pretend I hadn\u0027t nearly taken a nosedive onto her carpet. I was going to let her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess. But why? Hector died in 1977. No one would think the two were the same man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why take a chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis explained why I hadn\u0027t been able to find him anywhere that I\u0027d searched. He\u0027d no doubt changed his name again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie continued to read. Her lips tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me, then back at the paper. \"All of his victims have been the same type of woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I wasn\u0027t going to like this, but I asked anyway. \"What type?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blond, petite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Hector planned on killing me, too? Why hadn\u0027t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see that report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could make you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. \"I doubt that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I was still dizzy and my hands were shaking, she was probably right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a serial killer then and is a Weendigo now,\" she murmured, \"satisfying his need for like flesh in both forms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how did he become a Weendigo in the first place? Isn\u0027t that an Ojibwe warrior cursed by the great spirit?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The great mystery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. Hector was a lot of things, but Ojibwe wasn\u0027t one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure how the whole cursed-by-a-mystery works. We\u0027ll have to ask Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reminder that Cadotte wasn\u0027t back yet when he should have been caused a shadow of fear to tighten her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think Hector\u0027s here?\" I blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll know soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted the photo. \"I show this to my deputy. El-wood is a nosy old coot. He knows everyone in Crow Valley. If Hector is in town, Elwood\u0027s met him. We\u0027ll nail Herman/Hector\u0027s ass within a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad she had confidence, because I didn\u0027t. I\u0027d dealt with Hector. He was one scary dude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was up to something. I just knew it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-19.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
