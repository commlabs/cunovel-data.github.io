Not until we get some leads or something. I don’t want her knowing anything until we know for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. One more lie, but I could understand why. “How are you going to get leads?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you saw Bethany with Vaughn, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I happen to know where he lives. And he probably knows where Beth is and what happened to Dawson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know where he lives?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, a bit evilly. “I have my ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new panic dug in with icy fingers. “Wait. Oh no, you can’t go after him. That’s insane and dangerous!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon arched a coal-black brow. “As if you care what happens to me, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open. “I do care, jerk-face! Promise me you won’t do anything stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching me a few seconds, his smile turned sad. “I won’t make promises I know I’ll break.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Argh! You’re so freaking frustrating. I didn’t tell you so you’d go off and do something stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going to do anything stupid. And even if what I plan is risky and insane, it’s a well-thought-out level of stupidity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “That’s reassuring. Anyway, how do you know where he lives?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since we’re surrounded by people who potentially want to do my family harm, I tend to keep tabs on them like they keep tabs on me.” He leaned back, stretched his arms until his back bowed. Good God, I had to look away. But not before I caught the gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. “He’s been staying at a rental in Moorefield, but I’m not sure which one it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted on the couch, yawning. “What are you going to do? Stake out his block?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Do you have a James Bond fetish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Possibly,” he replied. “I just need a car not easily recognizable. Does your mom work tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows rose. “No, she’s off in the evening and will probably be sleeping, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her car would be perfect.” He shifted his weight on the couch and was now so close, his bare arm pressed into mine. “Even if Vaughn has seen her car, he won’t suspect it belongs to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooted over. “I’m not letting you take my mom’s car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” He inched over, grinning. A charming smile—the same he’d used on my mom the first time they’d met. “I’m a good driver.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not the point.” I moved against the arm of the couch. “I can’t just let you take her car without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. “You’re not getting involved in this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wanted to be involved in this, because it did involve me. I shook my head. “You want my mom’s car, then you get me along with it. It’s a two-for-one special.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon tipped his chin now, peering up through thick lashes. “Get you? Now that sounds way more interesting of a deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flushed. Daemon already had me, but he just didn’t know. “As in a partnership, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm.” Daemon flickered to the door. “Be ready after school tomorrow. Ditch Bartholomew by any means necessary. And do not speak a word of this to him. You and I will be playing spy alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking up some lame excuse about having to spend time with my mom, I successfully ditched a very pouty Blake. Getting the keys from my mom wasn’t too difficult, either. She’d crashed from a double shift as soon as she got home, and I knew she wouldn’t be awake to notice her car was gone. We’d waited until darkness fell, which clocked in around five thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon met me outside and tried to take the keys. “Nope. My mom’s car means I’m driving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at me but got into the passenger seat. His long legs were no match for the cramped seating. He looked like he’d outgrown the car. I laughed. Daemon scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned on a rock station, and he changed it to an oldies station. Moorefield was only fifteen minutes away, but it would be the longest damn drive of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how did you drop Butter-face?” he asked before we even pulled out of the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a dirty look. “I told him I have plans with my mom. It’s not like I spend every waking minute with Blake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I glanced at him. He stared out the window, one hand on the oh-shit handle. As if my driving was that bad. “What?” I repeated. “You know what I’m doing with him. It’s not like we’re hanging out and watching movies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I really know what you’re doing with him?” he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands tightened on the wheel. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscle worked in his jaw, and then he turned, angling his body toward me the best he could given the limited space. “You know, your whole life doesn’t have to involve training with Bradley. You can take time off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could also join us. I liked it…when you helped out, when you were there,” I admitted, feeling my cheeks burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. “You know my stance on that, but you need to stop avoiding Dee. She misses you. And that’s just messed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt chewed at me with small, razor-sharp teeth. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sorry?” he said. “What for? For being a crappy friend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a second, anger flashed through me, wild and hot like a fireball. “I’m not trying to be a crappy friend, Daemon. You know what I’m doing. You’re the one who told me to keep her out of this. Just tell Dee I’m sorry, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar challenge was in his voice. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we not talk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that would also be a no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t say anything else while he gave me directions to the subdivision where Vaughn lived. I parked the car halfway between the suspected six houses, grateful that my mom tinted the windows of her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Daemon started in again. “How has your training been going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you got over yourself, you’d know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked. “Are you still able to freeze things? Move objects around?” When I nodded, his eyes narrowed. “Have you had any unexpected outbursts of power?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the whole mini cyclone in my living room after seeing Bethany, I hadn’t. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why are you still training? The whole purpose was for you to get control. You have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to bang my head against the steering wheel, I groaned. “That’s not the only reason, Daemon. And you know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously I don’t,” he retorted, pushing back against his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, I love how you’re all up in my personal business but don’t want to be involved in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like talking about your personal business. It’s usually entertaining and always good for a laugh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I don’t,” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sighed as he twisted in his seat and tried to get comfortable. “This car sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was your idea. I, on the other hand, think the car is a perfect size. But that might be because I’m not the size of a mountain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snickered. “You’re the size of a little, itty bitty doll.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you say a vacant doll, I will hurt you.” I wound the necklace chain around my fingers. “Got that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared out the windshield, caught between wanting to just be angry with him—because that was easy—and wanting to explain myself. So much bubbled up in me that nothing would come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “You’re worn down. Dee’s worried. She won’t stop bugging me to check on you and see what’s wrong, since you won’t hang out with her anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, so we’re back to you doing things to make your sister happy? Are you getting bonus points for asking?” I asked before I could stop myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” He reached out, catching my chin in a gentle grasp, forcing me to look at him. And when I did, I couldn’t breathe. His eyes churned. “I’m worried. I’m worried for a thousand different reasons and I hate this—I hate feeling like I can’t do anything about it. That history is on repeat and even though I can see it as clear as day, I can’t stop it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words opened up a hole in my chest and suddenly I thought of Dad. When I was little and would get upset, usually over something stupid like a toy I wanted, I could never really put my frustration into words. Instead, I’d throw a fit or pout. And Dad…he always said the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse your words, Kitty-cat. Use your words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords were the most powerful tool. Simple and so often underestimated. They could heal. They could destroy. And I needed to use my words now. I wrapped my fingers around his wrist, welcoming the jolt that touching him gave me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon looked confused. “About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About everything—about not hanging out with Dee and being a terrible friend to Lesa and Carissa.” I took a deep breath and gently pulled his hand away. I looked out the windshield, blinking back tears. “And I’m sorry about not being able to stop training. I get why you don’t want me to. I really do. I understand that you don’t want me in danger and that you don’t trust Blake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sat back against the seat and I forced myself to continue. “Most of all, I do know you fear that I’m going to end up like Bethany and Dawson—whatever really did happen to them—and you want to protect me from that. I understand. And it…it kills me knowing that it hurts you, but you’ve got to understand why I need to be able to control and use my abilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me finish, okay?” I glanced at him and when he nodded, I took another breath. “This isn’t just about you and what you want. Or what you’re afraid of. This is about me—my future and my life. Granted, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life when it came to college, but now I face a future where if I step out of the range of the beta quartz, I’m going to be hunted. Like you. My mom will be in danger if an Arum sees and follows me home. And then there’s this whole DOD mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my hand around the obsidian. “I have to be able to defend myself and the people I care about. Because I can’t expect you to always be there to protect me. It’s not right or fair to either of us. That’s why I’m training with Blake. Not to piss you off. Not to get with him. I’m doing it so that I can stand beside you, as your equal, and not be someone you need to protect. And I’m doing this for myself, so that I don’t have to rely on anyone to save me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s lashes lowered, shielding his eyes. Seconds passed in silence and then he said, “I know. I know why you want to do this. And I respect that. I do.” There was a “but” coming. I could feel it in my bones. “But it’s hard to stand back and let this happen.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-35.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
