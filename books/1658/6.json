Through the pink branches she saw a light blue sky with no veins of Aether, no coating of glowing clouds. That had been the sky three hundred years ago, before the Unity. Before a massive solar flare had corrupted the Earth’s magnetosphere, opening the door to cosmic storms. To an alien atmosphere that was unimaginably devastating. Aether. This blue sky was what she pictured over the Still Blue—bright and open and calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her gaze and found Consul Hess sitting at a table twenty paces away. Small, with a marble top and two iron chairs, the table belonged in a bistro in a European square. Whatever Realm Hess chose, that detail never changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria looked down at herself. A kimono had replaced her black pants, shirt, and boots. This garment was made of thick cream brocade, patterned with red and pink flowers. It was beautiful, and far too tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this necessary?” she asked, as always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHess watched in silence as she walked over. He had a severe face, chiseled, with wide-set eyes and a thin mouth that gave him a lizard-like appearance. “It befits the Realm,” he said, his gaze traveling up and down her body. “And I find your Outsider clothing unsavory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria sat across from him, shifting uncomfortably in the chair. She could barely cross her legs in the dress, and what was the waxy coating on her lips? She touched her finger and came away with scarlet lipstick. Really. This was too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your clothes don’t befit the Realm,” she said. Hess was in Dweller grays, as usual—clothes similar to those she’d worn in Reverie all her life, the only difference being that his grays had blue stripes along the collar and sleeves to show his position as Consul. “Neither does this table or the coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHess ignored her and poured coffee into two delicate cups as pink petals sprinkled the table. Aria studied the gurgling sound, which was clear and sharp but oddly shapeless. The fragrant, rich scent set her mouth watering. Everything was the way it’d been for the past months. A fanciful Realm. This table and chairs. Strong, dark coffee. Except Hess’s hands were trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a sip. When he set the cup down, it struck with a clack. He raised his eyes to hers. “I’m disappointed, Aria. You’re late. I thought I had impressed the urgency of your task upon you. Now I wonder if you need to be reminded of what’s at stake if you fail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what’s at stake,” she said tightly. Talon. Reverie. Everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And yet you’ve taken a little detour. Do you think I can’t tell where you are? You’ve gone to see the boy’s uncle, haven’t you? Peregrine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHess was tracking her movements through the Smarteye. It didn’t surprise Aria, but she felt her pulse pick up anyway. She didn’t want him to know anything about Perry. “I can’t go north yet, Hess. The pass to the Horns is frozen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward. “I could have you there tomorrow on a Hover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They hate us,” she said. “They haven’t forgotten the Unity. I can’t go charging in as a Dweller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re Savages,” he said, waving a hand dismissively. “I don’t care what they think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria became aware of how quickly she was breathing. Roar sat up. He watched her intently in the real, sensing her tension. Savages. She’d once thought of them that way too. Now Roar’s presence anchored and calmed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to let me do this my way,” she said to Hess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like your way. You’re late reporting in. You’re wasting time with some Outsider. I want that information, Aria. Get me coordinates. A direction. A map. Anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, she noticed the shiftiness in his small eyes and the red flush creeping up his collar. In all their meetings over the winter, he’d never been this nervous and combative. Something had him worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to see Talon,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not until you get me what I need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said. “I need to see him—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything stopped. The cherry blossoms froze, suspending in midair around her. The sound of the wind vanished, and a sudden dead silence fell over the Realm. After an instant, the petals rose up in reverse, then seemed to catch and flitter down again, normally, floating to the ground as sounds returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria saw the shocked look on Hess’s face. “What was that?” she asked. “What just happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come back in three days,” he snapped. “Don’t be late, and you’d better be on your way north by then.” He fractioned out, disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hess!” she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria, what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar’s voice. She shifted her focus. His eyebrows were drawn with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m all right,” she said, quickly running through the commands in her mind to take off the Eye. Aria gripped it in her hand, rage blurring her vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar moved closer. “What happened?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. She wasn’t entirely sure herself. Something had gone wrong. She’d never seen a Realm freeze before. Had Hess done that on purpose to scare her? But he’d been nervous too. What was he hiding? Why the sudden urgency that she go to the Horns?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria,” Roar prompted. “Talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hess knows I’m here. And he wants me to head north right away,” she said, choosing her words carefully, making no mention of Talon. “He doesn’t care that the pass is frozen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a bastard, Hess.” Roar’s gaze moved beyond her, up the beach. “But I’ve got good news for you. Here comes your chance to break the glass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEREGRINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry walked down the beach toward Aria, aware of his every step. They’d only have a few minutes together at best, and he couldn’t reach her fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met Roar halfway. “Keep an ear out?” Perry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Roar said, cuffing him on the shoulder as he walked past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stood as he reached her. She pulled her dark hair over one shoulder. “Are you sure this is all right?” she asked, looking past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a little while,” he said. “Roar’s listening. Reef’s farther in on the trail.” It felt wrong to have men guarding him from his own tribe, but he was desperate to be alone with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you find Cinder?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Not yet. I will, though.” He wanted to reach for her, but he scented her temper. She was nervous about something. He had an idea what that was. “Twig—he’s an Aud—he told me what happened in the cookhouse. What people were saying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nothing, Perry. Only gossip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give them a week,” he said. “It’ll get easier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away and didn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry ran a hand over his jaw, not sure why it felt like they were still pretending around each other. “Aria, what’s going on?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed her arms, and her temper cooled and cooled, turning to ice. Perry fought against the weight of it settling over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hess knows I’m here,” she said at last. “He’s making me leave. I need to go in a few days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the name. Hess was the Dweller who’d thrown her out of the Pod. “Does he know it’s not safe to go north yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said. “He doesn’t care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fear gripped him suddenly. “Did he threaten you?” Perry asked, his mind churning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shook her head, and it hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has Talon. He’s using Talon, isn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “I’m sorry. This is one time I really wish I could lie to you. I didn’t want to burden you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry fisted his hands, squeezing them until his knuckles ached. Vale had planned the kidnapping, but he still felt responsible. That wouldn’t go away until Talon was home safe. His gaze moved up the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is where he was taken,” he said. “Right here. I watched the Dwellers kick him in the stomach and then drag him into a Hovercraft at the top of that dune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stepped toward him and took his hands. Her fingers were cool and soft, but her grip was firm. “Hess won’t hurt him,” she said. “He wants the Still Blue. He’ll give us Talon in exchange.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry couldn’t believe he had to buy his nephew. It was little different from what he would have to do to get Liv home, he realized. Vale had traded them both for food. Everything pointed to Perry going to the Horns. He needed the Still Blue—for his tribe, and for Talon. And he had to settle a debt with Sable for Liv not showing. Maybe then his sister would finally come home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s sooner than I thought,” he said, “but I’m going with you. We’ll leave in a few days and hope the pass is clear by then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if it’s not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “We’d battle against the ice. It would probably take us twice as long, but we could do it. I could get us there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria smiled at what he’d said. He didn’t know why, but it didn’t matter. She was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” she said. She wove her arms around him, turning her head to his chest. Perry brushed her hair away from her shoulder and breathed her in, letting the strength of her temper bring him back. One breath at a time, his anger faded into desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe traced the line of her spine with his thumb. Everything about her was graceful and strong. She drew back and met his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This …” He was going to tell her that this was how they should’ve come together, days ago in the woods. This was what he’d thought about all winter—what he’d missed. But he couldn’t get past the way she felt, or the way she was looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said. “This.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry bent and kissed her lips. She curved against him, her sigh a warm drift against his cheek, and then nothing existed beyond her mouth and her skin and the feel of her body against his. They didn’t have long. People nearby. He could barely hold the thoughts in his mind. She was everything, and he wanted more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Roar’s warning whistle, he froze, his lips on her neck. “Tell me you didn’t hear that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he heard Roar’s signal, louder this time, insistent. Perry winced and straightened, taking her hands. Her scent was wrapped around him. The last thing he wanted was to leave her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll get your Markings done before we go. And about hiding things between us … let’s drop it. It’s killing me not being able to touch you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria smiled up at him. “We’re leaving soon. Can we keep it up just until then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You like seeing me suffer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly. “The wait will be worth it, I promise. Now go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her once more, then tore himself away and ran up the beach, weightless over the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar watched him from the top of the beach with a grin. “That was beautiful, Per. It was killing me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry laughed, smacking him on the head as he jogged by. “Not everything’s meant for your ears.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-6.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
