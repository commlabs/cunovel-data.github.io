The vampire Saint-Germain seeks sanctuary at an isolated monastery, unwilling to abandon the hundreds of terrified villagers he has led in flight from the Huns. A few Roman soldiers and some village Watchmen are the monastery\u0027s defense force - and they are undermined by the religious fervor of some of the monks, who argue that since everyone\u0027s fate is in God\u0027s hands, it is foolish to defend themselves. In the hothouse atmosphere of the high-walled monastery, Saint-Germain must take special care when slaking his vampire thirst, for discovery of his True Nature will result in his True Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/burning-shadows-saint-germain-23.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/burning-shadows-saint-germain-23.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:30 PM"}
