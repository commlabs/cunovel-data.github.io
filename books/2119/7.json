Fowler, second-in-command, introduced him to the \"volunteer.\" \"His name is Bailey, I believe,\" said Fowler, pointing. \"He\u0027s a veteran. Four years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix only dimly heard her. He was looking at the mass of silicon plaster being hurriedly applied to Bailey\u0027s suit by three medics. He took a couple of steps toward the group and peered down into Bailey\u0027s screen. There was a lot of blood in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix stepped back, choking with a sudden desire to gag. \"I know,\" said Fowler. \"But they say he should live just long enough to do the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he... ?\" Felix began, then found he had lost his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he know, you mean,\" asked Fowler. Felix nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. He knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027ll do it. I told you. He\u0027s a veteran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix looked at Fowler, looked away. \"Is that what a veteran is?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partly,\" said Fowler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix, for no clear reason, nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" said Fowler brusquely, her voice returning to a businesslike tone. \"It\u0027s time to show you the target.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix followed her back to the circle of officers that served as command center. They passed hundreds of warriors preparing to travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a seat,\" offered Fowler. \"And key your input relay. I\u0027ll show you the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix sat, keyed the proper key. After a brief pause, his holos swelled and the three-dimensional topograchart of the Knuckle, appeared transmitted from Fowler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe view was of the Knuckle\u0027s southern face. The side closest to their position, at a distance of perhaps 700 meters. Fowler\u0027s disembodied voice began to narrate: \"This is from about the center of the maze. Rather imposing is it not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix grunted in response. The viewpoint altered. \"This is from the nearest edge of the maze. Notice the sides still appear smooth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix already had. Like a sculpture, he thought, gazing at the apparently sheer sides that seemed to have poured upward from the sandy soil. It was as if it had been molten ore at one time. How else could the smooth sloping texture be achieved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene changed again. Now he could see the various sloping folds at the base. And something else: A black ovular hole less than 20 meters above the ground and partially obscured by a vertical ridge. He stared at the ridge-its edge looked sharp as a knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your target, that black oval,\" offered Fowler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are others that you can\u0027t see from this angle. But the computers think that this one goes almost straight through to the core underneath.\" A thin dotted line appeared on the screen, running a twisting course from the sand to the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your route,\" said Fowler. \"Watch that ridge, it\u0027s as sharp as it looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" asked Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" answered Fowler distantly. \"But it doesn\u0027t matter. It will blow like everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene changed again. Felix seemed to be in the air directly above the spikelike summit of the knuckle itself. The terrain at the base was clearly visible, as well as the beginning of the maze. Several small arrows appeared at various maze entrances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cannon will be here,\" continued Fowler. \"They won\u0027t actually damage the surface of the knuckle. But they should be able to clear a path for you people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother arrow appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your starting point. Key that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix touched a switch. The arrow became a permanent part of his \"map.\" He had done the same with the dotted line showing his route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s about it,\" said Fowler as she stopped the broadcast. \"Have you got it all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded, looked at her sitting on the ground beside him. \"A lot of information. Why didn\u0027t the assault force have this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did. But they never had the right opportunity. Or,\" her voice became slightly hushed, \"the right weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we do,\" replied Felix with bitterness. \"Bailey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler looked away. Her voice was a faint whisper: \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned back toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About your command. You\u0027re entitled to added rank. Would you like to be a Lieutenant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler seemed to hesitate before speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you don\u0027t care about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix thought about it. \"No,\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler hesitated again, then slid closer toward him on the sand conspiratorially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix, don\u0027t worry about the command part of it. We\u0027ve found a vet to organize your bunch. He\u0027ll take care of most things. Just tell him what you want and let him do the ordering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bolov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix almost laughed. \"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I know of, unless you have questions.\" He stared at the distant spire of his destination, almost completely obscured by a rolling cloud of sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one question...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you?\" prompted Fowler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Felix, his voice cold. \"Why us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe breathed a long sigh into her mike before replying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix, who would you use? The rest of us just got here.... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve made other Drops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ve never touched an ant. None of us. And you, you and your people, are the three percent, the only survivors from an assault of 10,000 warriors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s luck. Random chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely. Not in this business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Business? What business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"War.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Is it too simple?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shook his head. \"Too sloppy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral flashes lit the area. The light was joined by the hot, razor scream of Blazer cannon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix stood up, watching as the beams arced through the air toward the knuckle. But the beams landed short, in the maze itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right on time,\" said Fowler, standing beside him. \"We\u0027d better get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this for?\" asked Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The maze. We haven\u0027t got time to negotiate it. So we\u0027re leveling it up to the leading edge of the knuckle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded vaguely, watching giant shards of sand vaulting wildly into the air. Soon the entire maze was obscured by an enormous dust cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" said Fowler. \"The Major wants to see you before we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much time do we have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About...\" She broke off quickly, listening, Felix assumed, to some message he couldn\u0027t hear. \"None,\" she said at last. \"None at all. The ants are coming out.\" Together, they ran to the cannon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Major was two hundred meters east of the carnage standing off from the rest of his people watching the battle. Lines of warriors met the onslaught of the ants without the help of the barricade-at the mouth of the channel blown through the center of the maze. The ants, jammed together in the middle of the channel for some reason, were growing steadily toward them as rolling dead piles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix was impressed. They were really holding. For now. The Major had been standing with ponderous armored arms crossed over his chest. He loosened one and pointed past the battle to the foot of the Knuckle just visible over the dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the last spot we can see to cover you, Scout. See it? Looks like a saddle. Or a bench.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Major looked at him. \"We\u0027ll use the last of the cannon-fire to cover your approach down the side of the little highway we\u0027ve made. But we won\u0027t be able to help you in there. That ridge blocks our line of fire. But the people you\u0027re taking should be able to hold\u0027em off you long enough to... plant the charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it, Felix,\" said Fowler from beside them. Her voice held muffled urgency alongside cheerleading. \"Do it. We\u0027re all counting on you to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix regarded her blandly. \"To what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler shrugged uneasily. \"To... to do the job. We\u0027re all counting on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you\u0027re all counting on me to throw Bailey down that hole, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Felix,\" snapped the Major. \"That doesn\u0027t help. And we can\u0027t hold them much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix looked again at the line of blazing warriors. He saw them, then, as the desperate people they were. He felt the proximity of their panic. They\u0027re not heroes, he thought, they\u0027re stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he knew that they would never hold for his retreat. Once they reached the Hive, they would be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis group was forming up beside them. A dozen warriors. Bolov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler faced Bolov. \"All set?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Bolov, nodding shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all know what to do?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Bailey?\" Felix asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov shrugged, looked at the sand between them. \"I think we\u0027d better hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded. \"Okay. Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov gestured toward the warriors. \"Teare\u0027s got him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov nodded. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix sighed. \"Better get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov nodded again, turned to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix regarded the warriors shifting nervously, all eyes on the battle. Or on him. He turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines were still holding, the rolling twittering exoskeleton still coming on. He felt something he couldn\u0027t pin down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot eagerness, of course. And not simple excitement. Anticipation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov appeared carrying Bailey over a shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready?\" Felix asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov laughed shortly. \"Hell, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix smiled distantly. Yes. Anticipation. One way or another, it was finally about to stop happening to them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, let\u0027s get down to it.\" He nodded to Fowler. \"Give the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler nodded, said something only she and the cannon crews could hear. There was a brief pause and then, with a searing scream, the remaining cannon fired. The main thrust of ants pouring through the channel died almost instantly as they were simultaneously broiled, sliced, soldered, by the intersecting hourglass beams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix turned to the ones to follow him, met their joint gaze, turned away, and began the rush down across the blackened sand. He didn\u0027t look back to see if they followed, but loped firmly ahead at a pace a laden Bolov could match. The cannon ceased abruptly as he reached and passed the holding lines. He began to accelerate as the sand flattened out before him. Ant remains smoldered in his path, thinly scattered here to the side of the reeling main body. He glanced at the jumbled mass of enemy as he passed quickly alongside their length. He was drawing no obvious surge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chanced a little more speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was almost to the next section of maze-and cover, past the last lines of remains, before he looked back to the others. They were right behind Bolov in the lead, stumbling up the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix kept running, deftly avoiding the smoking ant refuse. He wanted to reach the base of the knuckle, perhaps even the bench itself, before the ants could reorganize their attack. The flashes of blazerfire from off to his right told him he had been too hopeful. The other holes, unseen from his position must already be emitting more ants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, there was hope. The others were still firing, still standing fast against a certain powerful impulse to flee. And, if he couldn\u0027t see ants yet, they couldn\u0027t see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr would that matter... Wouldn\u0027t they be able to detect his presence on the very walls of their hive? Would they actually have to see them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that thought, Felix leaped over the last rocky steps of the desert floor and pounded up the slopes of the Knuckle itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footing was firm, the grainy surface perfect traction for his plassteel boots. He saw instantly that his proscribed route was unnecessarily cautious; he changed direction abruptly and climbed the slope to the bench in three giant powered strides. The others, he knew without looking, would follow his lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bench was, for the time being, empty. The target hole loomed over him invitingly, only ten meters or so up the slope. The wall here was steeper than he had realized, but still easily navigable. Felix nodded to himself. It was going to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked back, and the others were almost there. Bolov had dropped back a bit into the crowd to protect his irreplaceable cargo. Felix waved them exuberantly toward him, felt the rush of relief from those others who reached the bench and found it still empty. They turned too, and began to wave Bolov quickly forward. He heard their voices, exultant with unrestrained happiness, \"We can do it. We\u0027re gonna make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Bolov was there on the bench itself and moving through the crowd, holding out Bailey toward him like some honored trophy, and then the nightmare began. There were screams and shouts and people pointing and firing their blazers at close range and the ants were everywhere, everywhere around them. Not from the saddleback, not from the multitudes, but from the target hole itself. Ten, twenty, fifty ants appeared in its mouth and slid, clawing and flailing, down the steep slope into them. Someone screamed again and Felix was knocked off balance as the ones closest to the attack tried to push back away. He fell to one knee, but dragged himself up quickly, yelling Bolov\u0027s name and trying to reach him through the panicking mob of warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimly he heard Bolov respond and then he saw him through the jumbling mass. Bolov had dropped Bailey and was being pushed away from him by the crowd. Felix and Bolov slammed toward one another, reaching Bailey simultaneously, lifting him, staggering, toward the slope and the hole. A blazer struck the slope beside them and Felix screamed for the warriors to stop firing before they killed one another or him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled and drove himself against the crowd toward the slope, punching through at last and leaning against it, with Bolov beside him, holding Bailey\u0027s legs in one arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePandemonium. Warriors screaming and firing and trying to run all at the same time. Beams of Blazerfire struck randomly everywhere and Felix motioned to Bolov that they must climb the slope, must do it now while the slightest chance still remained. Bolov seemed to nod or at least seemed to understand for they started up the slope together, slipping and sliding and being jarred by the jostling, teeming warriors and then a mass of ants was upon him and he lost Bailey; he was covered, engulfed by the ants that slid down into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struck out blindly, wildly, smashing, ripping exoskeleton, struggling to get his feet underneath him. Twice he struck not exoskeleton but plassteel and the thought of it made him shudder, cringing. He was up then, and Bolov was beside him and had Bailey and they shouldered through the ants and started again up the slope and there was a horrible agonizing scream as a flash of blazerfire split the air between them, carving a deep, irreconcilable hole through Bailey\u0027s faceplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God, my God...\" shouted Bolov and he saw that it was not just from the shock of losing their only weapon but from pain as well. For the stray bolt of blazerfire had cut not only through Bailey but through Bolov as well. A pulsing, red-hot bubble had appeared on the inside of Bolov\u0027s shoulder. Felix stared in morbid amazement as the bubble rose and expanded and threatened to burst as it surely must. Bolov screamed again and clutched at his shoulder with his free arm and shouted over and over that he was dying, dying...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix had him then, dropping Bailey. He had his helmet clamped tightly to his side with his left arm as he launched them up the slope. His right arm stretched out high for some purchase, the fingers of his gloves clawing wildly at the grainy hive. He jerked and kicked and struggled and slid back some at every movement but somehow managed to get the two of them up the slope and away from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were several meters to the left of the hole itself, parallel to it and the ants couldn\u0027t reach them without slipping down. The few that managed to leap toward them he met with a resounding kick that shook them free of their grip on the wall and sent them sliding down into the roar of battle below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriefly, Felix noted the many who were already running away, with the ants hotly pursuing. And farther, he saw that the covering fire from the maze itself had long since halted. He was alone as he knew he would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled and kicked out at another ant, sending it sliding and at the same time pushing himself and his cargo farther up the slope. Bolov was completely limp in his grasp, moaning loudly, unintelligibly. Felix grasped him with both hands and yanked him upward onto the slope beside him. He reached for Bolov\u0027s forearm and began to work the relays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolov, seeing what be was doing, began to sob. He tried, feebly, to struggle out of Felix\u0027s grasp. But Felix held him firmly against the slope, slapping away his futilely waving arms. Grimly, he continued to work relays. He looked up once and saw that the mouth of the hole was less than three meters away and just beneath him. He was just in the right position, the ants couldn\u0027t reach him in time. If only they wouldn\u0027t know to toss Bolov away...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last relay controlled the interior light of Bolov\u0027s suit and then Felix saw the man\u0027s face clearly for the first time, saw that he was perhaps five years older. Saw that he badly needed a shave, saw that he was weeping openly...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix placed the surface of his face screen against Bolov\u0027s. \"You know what to do?\" he asked in a cold, distant, tone. Bolov cursed him deliberately, soundlessly and Felix knew that he would do it. He nodded, almost to himself. He judged the distance to the hole, tensed his muscles. Bolov\u0027s voice stopped him cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, Felix,\" said Bolov calmly, hopelessly, \"are a filthy human being.\" Felix saw the lips working, saw the tongue accentuate each syllable, and felt a weight upon him growing and growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Engine only nodded in agreement. And then it rolled over, holding Bolov with both hands, and flung him into the hive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix was sliding, down into the mass of humans and ants and tearing himself away and through them and then he was sliding again down the slope of the saddleback and then he was running, running, across the blackened sand toward the maze. He leaped and turned and darted through the ants and the warriors. Some were alive, some were not. But he paid no attention either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldered past several slower moving warriors and stomped wildly into the entrance of what remained of the maze. He passed more and more warriors as he reached the leveled area. But he didn\u0027t stop, didn\u0027t hesitate. The fear, and only the fear, controlled. The terror...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast the blackened sand and to the slopes of the mesa, traveling now as fast as he could travel. Arms waving, eyes flickering, tears welling up in his eyes, he ran. And ran and ran and then he was up the mesa and crossing it and he thought that it was too late now, that Bolov would never be able to do it by now. He must be dead already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still he ran, the terror ruling all. He tripped at the edge of the mesa. He fell, at 100 kilometers an hour, he struck the sand and rolled. He carved deep ruts where elbows and knees dug into the sand. A great cloud erupted around him. He continued to slide across the last few meters and then he fell, completely out of control, down the long slope of the mesa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he struck bottom, Bolov ejected, and the battle, finally, ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe awoke, briefly to the sound of the Medic\u0027s impersonally soothing tones. He was told that Connection was being made. He was told not to move. He was told of his myriad injuries. He was told that Transit to the Terra was forthcoming. He was told that be had been found at the end of the last sweep for survivors, that he was, in fact, quite lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he heard none of it. Instead he only stared at the black sky above him. Night at last, he thought. And his eyes reluctantly closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Doctor eyed the worst of the cyst-like bruises, the one that completely covered his right shoulder. \"You can\u0027t wear a suit like that, no,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix felt a surge of relief so overwhelming that the awful pain was momentarily eclipsed. He noted the Doctor\u0027s glowering, disgusted expression and felt his cheeks to see if they were red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey debriefed him and fed him and were surprised to learn, from his recorder, that he was the one. They had surely thought the hero of the Knuckle suitable for martyrdom. They later became angry when he ignored their questions. They thought it was because he now thought himself to be too superior to respond. This belief intimidated one of the officers who marked his personal log with a negative entry. But Felix had been silent not from a sense of superiority, but from shame and suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey woke him up entering the bay. They laughed and joked and were nervous. Then they became hushed and reverent, when they found his lone sleeping figure at the end of the line of what they thought were empty berths. Quietly, they stowed their gear and crept out into the hall to talk. Out of respect for a Veteran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nightmare was odd, intangible even at the time. Some nameless formless fear was reaching out to him. It grew and swelled toward him until he admitted he was waking, that most of him had been awake for some time, and that the fear was not of some nebulous terror, but of his next Drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the bay was asleep. He pulled himself up out of his berth gingerly, wincing from the pain of the cysts. He padded back and forth between the rows of berths. He found he was repeating the doctor\u0027s words over and over again in his mind. It was reassuring, he found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lone head of a young man appeared over the edge of a berth. The two blue eyes followed his pacing. Felix stopped at last and stared back. But the young man was not embarrassed by this. Instead he spoke: \"What\u0027s it like?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix told him to ask someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" replied the young man. \"You\u0027re the only survivor from this whole group. The first one I\u0027ve even heard of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re some kind of first.\" Forest had said. How many firsts, he wondered, am I going to have to carry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left, just outside, away from the blue eyes. He wandered aimlessly about the corridors of the silent ship. After a while he realized he was naked and returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue eyes were closed, the boy asleep. Felix eased himself slowly into his berth. He slept almost immediately, the doctor\u0027s words his last conscious thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe console at the foot of the berth had called to Drop all \"available combat personnel\" from his squad, his group, his sector. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/armor/page-7.html","bookId":2119,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM"}
