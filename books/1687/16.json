It\u0027s a gauzy, violet-tinted world, with no hard edges, and many places to hide. I push through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent of cinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try to trap it, but it dissolves like mist through my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital room in 13, I remember. I was under the influence of sleep syrup. My heel had been injured after I\u0027d climbed out on a branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12. Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with me as I was drifting off. He had whispered something I couldn\u0027t quite catch. But some part of my brain had trapped his single word of reply and let it swim up through my dreams to taunt me now. \"Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorphling dulls the extremes of all emotions, so instead of a stab of sorrow, I merely feel emptiness. A hollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloom. Unfortunately, there\u0027s not enough of the drug left in my veins for me to ignore the pain in the left side of my body. That\u0027s where the bullet hit. My hands fumble over the thick bandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what I\u0027m still doing here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t him, the man kneeling before me on the square, the burned one from the Nut. He didn\u0027t pull the trigger. It was someone farther back in the crowd. There was less a sense of penetration than the feeling that I\u0027d been struck with a sledgehammer. Everything after the moment of impact is confusion riddled with gunfire. I try to sit up, but the only thing I manage is a moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white curtain that divides my bed from the next patient\u0027s whips back, and Johanna Mason stares down at me. At first I feel threatened, because she attacked me in the arena. I have to remind myself that she did it to save my life. It was part of the rebel plot. But still, that doesn\u0027t mean she doesn\u0027t despise me. Maybe her treatment of me was all an act for the Capitol?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m alive,\" I say rustily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kidding, brainless.\" Johanna walks over and plunks down on my bed, sending spikes of pain shooting across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I know we\u0027re not in for some warm reunion scene. \"Still a little sore?\" With an expert hand, she quickly detaches the morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped into the crook of her own. \"They started cutting back my supply a few days ago. Afraid I\u0027m going to turn into one of those freaks from Six. I\u0027ve had to borrow from you when the coast was clear. Didn\u0027t think you\u0027d mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMind? How can I mind when she was almost tortured to death by Snow after the Quarter Quell? I have no right to mind, and she knows it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna sighs as the morphling enters her bloodstream. \"Maybe they were onto something in Six. Drug yourself out and paint flowers on your body. Not such a bad life. Seemed happier than the rest of us, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the weeks since I left 13, she\u0027s gained some weight back. A soft down of hair has sprouted on her shaved head, helping to hide some of the scars. But if she\u0027s siphoning off my morphling, she\u0027s struggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got this head doctor who comes around every day. Supposed to be helping me recover. Like some guy who\u0027s spent his life in this rabbit warren\u0027s going to fix me up. Complete idiot. At least twenty times a session he reminds me that I\u0027m totally safe.\" I manage a smile. It\u0027s a truly stupid thing to say, especially to a victor. As if such a state of being ever existed, anywhere, for anyone. \"How about you, Mockingjay? You feel totally safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. Right up until I got shot,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. That bullet never even touched you. Cinna saw to that,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of the layers of protective armor in my Mockingjay outfit. But the pain came from somewhere. \"Broken ribs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even. Bruised pretty good. The impact ruptured your spleen. They couldn\u0027t repair it.\" She gives a dismissive wave of her hand. \"Don\u0027t worry, you don\u0027t need one. And if you did, they\u0027d find you one, wouldn\u0027t they? It\u0027s everybody\u0027s job to keep you alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you hate me?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partly,\" she admits. \"Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you\u0027re a little hard to swallow. With your tacky romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn\u0027t an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please feel free to take this personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have been the Mockingjay. No one would\u0027ve had to feed you lines,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. But no one likes me,\" she tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They trusted you, though. To get me out,\" I remind her. \"And they\u0027re afraid of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, maybe. In the Capitol, you\u0027re the one they\u0027re scared of now.\" Gale appears in the doorway, and Johanna neatly unhooks herself and reattaches me to the morphling drip. \"Your cousin\u0027s not afraid of me,\" she says confidentially. She scoots off my bed and crosses to the door, nudging Gale\u0027s leg with her hip as she passes him. \"Are you, gorgeous?\" We can hear her laughter as she disappears down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my eyebrows at him as he takes my hand. \"Terrified,\" he mouths. I laugh, but it turns into a wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy.\" He strokes my face as the pain ebbs. \"You\u0027ve got to stop running straight into trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But someone blew up a mountain,\" I answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of pulling back, he leans in closer, searching my face. \"You think I\u0027m heartless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re not. But I won\u0027t tell you it\u0027s okay,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he draws back, almost impatiently. \"Katniss, what difference is there, really, between crushing our enemy in a mine or blowing them out of the sky with one of Beetee\u0027s arrows? The result is the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. We were under attack in Eight, for one thing. The hospital was under attack,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and those hoverplanes came from District Two,\" he says. \"So, by taking them out, we prevented further attacks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that kind of thinking...you could turn it into an argument for killing anyone at any time. You could justify sending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent the districts from getting out of line,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t buy that,\" he tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" I reply. \"It must be those trips to the arena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. We know how to disagree,\" he says. \"We always have. Maybe it\u0027s good. Between you and me, we\u0027ve got District Two now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" For a moment a feeling of triumph flares up inside me. Then I think about the people on the square. \"Was there fighting after I was shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much. The workers from the Nut turned on the Capitol soldiers. The rebels just sat by and watched,\" he says. \"Actually, the whole country just sat by and watched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s what they do best,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d think that losing a major organ would entitle you to lie around a few weeks, but for some reason, my doctors want me up and moving almost immediately. Even with the morphling, the internal pain\u0027s severe the first few days, but then it slacks off considerably. The soreness from the bruised ribs, however, promises to hang on for a while. I begin to resent Johanna dipping into my morphling supply, but I still let her take whatever she likes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumors of my death have been running rampant, so they send in the team to film me in my hospital bed. I show off my stitches and impressive bruising and congratulate the districts on their successful battle for unity. Then I warn the Capitol to expect us soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of my rehabilitation, I take short walks aboveground each day. One afternoon, Plutarch joins me and gives me an update on our current situation. Now that District 2 has allied with us, the rebels are taking a breather from the war to regroup. Fortifying supply lines, seeing to the wounded, reorganizing their troops. The Capitol, like 13 during the Dark Days, finds itself completely cut off from outside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over its enemies. Unlike 13, the Capitol is not in a position to reinvent itself and become self-sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the city might be able to scrape along for a while,\" says Plutarch. \"Certainly, there are emergency supplies stockpiled. But the significant difference between Thirteen and the Capitol are the expectations of the populace. Thirteen was used to hardship, whereas in the Capitol, all they\u0027ve known is Panem et Circenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" I recognizePanem , of course, but the rest is nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a language called Latin about a place called Rome,\" he explains. \"Panem et Circensestranslates into \u0027Bread and Circuses.\u0027 The writer was saying that in return for full bellies and entertainment, his people had given up their political responsibilities and therefore their power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about the Capitol. The excess of food. And the ultimate entertainment. The Hunger Games. \"So that\u0027s what the districts are for. To provide the bread and circuses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And as long as that kept rolling in, the Capitol could control its little empire. Right now, it can provide neither, at least at the standard the people are accustomed to,\" says Plutarch. \"We have the food and I\u0027m about to orchestrate an entertainment propo that\u0027s sure to be popular. After all, everybody loves a wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze in my tracks, sick at the idea of what he\u0027s suggesting. Somehow staging some perverse wedding between Peeta and me. I haven\u0027t been able to face that one-way glass since I\u0027ve been back and, at my own request, only get updates about Peeta\u0027s condition from Haymitch. He speaks very little about it. Different techniques are being tried. There will never truly be a way to cure him. And now they want me to marry Peeta for a propo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlutarch rushes to reassure me. \"Oh, no, Katniss. Not your wedding. Finnick and Annie\u0027s. All you need to do is show up and pretend to be happy for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one of the few things I won\u0027t have to pretend, Plutarch,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few days bring a flurry of activity as the event is planned. The differences between the Capitol and 13 are thrown into sharp relief by the event. When Coin says \"wedding,\" she means two people signing a piece of paper and being assigned a new compartment. Plutarch means hundreds of people dressed in finery at a three-day celebration. It\u0027s amusing to watch them haggle over the details. Plutarch has to fight for every guest, every musical note. After Coin vetoes a dinner, entertainment, and alcohol, Plutarch yells, \"What\u0027s the point of the propo if no one\u0027s having any fun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget. But even a quiet celebration causes a stir in 13, where they seem to have no holidays at all. When it\u0027s announced that children are wanted to sing District 4\u0027s wedding song, practically every kid shows up. There\u0027s no shortage of volunteers to help make decorations. In the dining hall, people chat excitedly about the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it\u0027s more than the festivities. Maybe it\u0027s that we are all so starved for something good to happen that we want to be part of it. It would explain why - when Plutarch has a fit over what the bride will wear - I volunteer to take Annie back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of evening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs. All of the wedding gowns he designed for me went back to the Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory Tour. I\u0027m a little leery about being with Annie since all I really know about her is that Finnick loves her and everybody thinks she\u0027s mad. On the hovercraft ride, I decide she\u0027s less mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in the conversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green eyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you find yourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty air. Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands over her ears as if to block out a painful sound. All right, she\u0027s strange, but if Finnick loves her, that\u0027s good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got permission for my prep team to come along, so I\u0027m relieved of having to make any fashion decisions. When I open the closet, we all fall silent because Cinna\u0027s presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then Octavia drops to her knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against her cheek, and bursts into tears. \"It\u0027s been so long,\" she gasps, \"since I\u0027ve seen anything pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite reservations on Coin\u0027s side that it\u0027s too extravagant, and on Plutarch\u0027s side that it\u0027s too drab, the wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred lucky guests culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday clothes, the decorations are made from autumn foliage, the music is provided by a choir of children accompanied by the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with his instrument. So it\u0027s simple, frugal by the Capitol\u0027s standards. It doesn\u0027t matter because nothing can compete with the beauty of the couple. It isn\u0027t about their borrowed finery - Annie wears a green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one of Peeta\u0027s suits that they altered - although the clothes are striking. Who can look past the radiant faces of two people for whom this day was once a virtual impossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from 10, conducts the ceremony, since it\u0027s similar to the one used in his district. But there are unique touches of District 4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple during their vows, the touching of each other\u0027s lips with salt water, and the ancient wedding song, which likens marriage to a sea voyage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I don\u0027t have to pretend to be happy for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the kiss that seals the union, the cheers, and a toast with apple cider, the fiddler strikes up a tune that turns every head from 12. We may have been the smallest, poorest district in Panem, but we know how to dance. Nothing has been officially scheduled at this point, but Plutarch, who\u0027s calling the propo from the control room, must have his fingers crossed. Sure enough, Greasy Sae grabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of the floor and faces off with him. People pour in to join them, forming two long lines. And the dancing begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing off to the side, clapping to the rhythm, when a bony hand pinches me above the elbow. Johanna scowls at me. \"Are you going to miss the chance to let Snow see you dancing?\" She\u0027s right. What could spell victory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around to music? I find Prim in the crowd. Since winter evenings gave us a lot of time to practice, we\u0027re actually pretty good partners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we take our places in the line. It hurts, but the satisfaction of having Snow watch me dance with my little sister reduces other feelings to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDancing transforms us. We teach the steps to the District 13 guests. Insist on a special number for the bride and groom. Join hands and make a giant, spinning circle where people show off their footwork. Nothing silly, joyful, or fun has happened in so long. This could go on all night if not for the last event planned in Plutarch\u0027s propo. One I hadn\u0027t heard about, but then it was meant to be a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour people wheel out a huge wedding cake from a side room. Most of the guests back up, making way for this rarity, this dazzling creation with blue-green, white-tipped icing waves swimming with fish and sailboats, seals and sea flowers. But I push my way through the crowd to confirm what I knew at first sight. As surely as the embroidery stitches in Annie\u0027s gown were done by Cinna\u0027s hand, the frosted flowers on the cake were done by Peeta\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may seem like a small thing, but it speaks volumes. Haymitch has been keeping a great deal from me. The boy I last saw, screaming his head off, trying to tear free of his restraints, could never have made this. Never have had the focus, kept his hands steady, designed something so perfect for Finnick and Annie. As if anticipating my reaction, Haymitch is at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s you and me have a talk,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the hall, away from the cameras, I ask, \"What\u0027s happening to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaymitch shakes his head. \"I don\u0027t know. None of us knows. Sometimes he\u0027s almost rational, and then, for no reason, he goes off again. Doing the cake was a kind of therapy. He\u0027s been working on it for days. Watching him...he seemed almost like before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, he\u0027s got the run of the place?\" I ask. The idea makes me nervous on about five different levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no. He frosted under heavy guard. He\u0027s still under lock and key. But I\u0027ve talked to him,\" Haymitch says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Face-to-face?\" I ask. \"And he didn\u0027t go nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Pretty angry with me, but for all the right reasons. Not telling him about the rebel plot and whatnot.\" Haymitch pauses a moment, as if deciding something. \"He says he\u0027d like to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m on a frosting sailboat, tossed around by blue-green waves, the deck shifting beneath my feet. My palms press into the wall to steady myself. This wasn\u0027t part of the plan. I wrote Peeta off in 2. Then I was to go to the Capitol, kill Snow, and get taken out myself. The gunshot was only a temporary setback. Never was I supposed to hear the wordsHe says he\u0027d like to see you. But now that I have, there\u0027s no way to refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt midnight, I\u0027m standing outside the door to his cell. Hospital room. We had to wait for Plutarch to finish getting his wedding footage, which, despite the lack of what he calls razzle-dazzle, he\u0027s pleased with. \"The best thing about the Capitol basically ignoring Twelve all these years is that you people still have a little spontaneity. The audience eats that up. Like when Peeta announced he was in love with you or you did the trick with the berries. Makes for good television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I could meet with Peeta privately. But the audience of doctors has assembled behind the one-way glass, clipboards ready, pens poised. When Haymitch gives me the okay in my earpiece, I slowly open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose blue eyes lock on me instantly. He\u0027s got three restraints on each arm, and a tube that can dispense a knockout drug just in case he loses control. He doesn\u0027t fight to free himself, though, only observes me with the wary look of someone who still hasn\u0027t ruled out that he\u0027s in the presence of a mutt. I walk over until I\u0027m standing about a yard from the bed. There\u0027s nothing to do with my hands, so I cross my arms protectively over my ribs before I speak. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he responds. It\u0027s like his voice, almost his voice, except there\u0027s something new in it. An edge of suspicion and reproach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haymitch said you wanted to talk to me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at you, for starters.\" It\u0027s like he\u0027s waiting for me to transform into a hybrid drooling wolf right before his eyes. He stares so long I find myself casting furtive glances at the one-way glass, hoping for some direction from Haymitch, but my earpiece stays silent. \"You\u0027re not very big, are you? Or particularly pretty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he\u0027s been through hell and back, and yet somehow the observation rubs me the wrong way. \"Well, you\u0027ve looked better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaymitch\u0027s advice to back off gets muffled by Peeta\u0027s laughter. \"And not even remotely nice. To say that to me after all I\u0027ve been through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We\u0027ve all been through a lot. And you\u0027re the one who was known for being nice. Not me.\" I\u0027m doing everything wrong. I don\u0027t know why I feel so defensive. He\u0027s been tortured! He\u0027s been hijacked! What\u0027s wrong with me? Suddenly, I think I might start screaming at him - I\u0027m not even sure about what - so I decide to get out of there. \"Look, I don\u0027t feel so well. Maybe I\u0027ll drop by tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve just reached the door when his voice stops me. \"Katniss. I remember about the bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bread. Our one moment of real connection before the Hunger Games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They showed you the tape of me talking about it,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Is there a tape of you talking about it? Why didn\u0027t the Capitol use it against me?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made it the day you were rescued,\" I answer. The pain in my chest wraps around my ribs like a vise. The dancing was a mistake. \"So what do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You. In the rain,\" he says softly. \"Digging in our trash bins. Burning the bread. My mother hitting me. Taking the bread out for the pig but then giving it to you instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. That\u0027s what happened,\" I say. \"The next day, after school, I wanted to thank you. But I didn\u0027t know how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were outside at the end of the day. I tried to catch your eye. You looked away. And then...for some reason, I think you picked a dandelion.\" I nod. He does remember. I have never spoken about that moment aloud. \"I must have loved you a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did.\" My voice catches and I pretend to cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you love me?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my eyes on the tiled floor. \"Everyone says I did. Everyone says that\u0027s why Snow had you tortured. To break me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not an answer,\" he tells me. \"I don\u0027t know what to think when they show me some of the tapes. In that first arena, it looked like you tried to kill me with those tracker jackers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was trying to kill all of you,\" I say. \"You had me treed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later, there\u0027s a lot of kissing. Didn\u0027t seem very genuine on your part. Did you like kissing me?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes,\" I admit. \"You know people are watching us now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. What about Gale?\" he continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy anger\u0027s returning. I don\u0027t care about his recovery - this isn\u0027t the business of the people behind the glass. \"He\u0027s not a bad kisser either,\" I say shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it was okay with both of us? You kissing the other?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It wasn\u0027t okay with either of you. But I wasn\u0027t asking your permission,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeeta laughs again, coldly, dismissively. \"Well, you\u0027re a piece of work, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaymitch doesn\u0027t protest when I walk out. Down the hall. Through the beehive of compartments. Find a warm pipe to hide behind in a laundry room. It takes a long time before I get to the bottom of why I\u0027m so upset. When I do, it\u0027s almost too mortifying to admit. All those months of taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am. Violent. Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I hate him for it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-16.html","bookId":1687,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:15 AM"}
