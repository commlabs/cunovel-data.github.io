No need to go into the specific differences, though. It\u0027s all cool. Discussion over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron walks down the aisle and stands in front of my chair. \"It\u0027s against regulation for a soldier to talk about the political situation in Israel while in an IDF uniform. But I guarantee that you can get into a long political discussion with any Israeli out of uniform. And I also guarantee that you\u0027ll get a hundred and fifty different opinions if you talk to a hundred Israelis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa, that\u0027s a lot of opinions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girls, my job in the IDF is to protect Israel. As a private, or new trainee, your job is to take orders. You will be treated like a real Israeli soldier, and you will act like a real Israeli soldier. When we say get in formation,\u0027 you get in formation or you\u0027ll be doing twenty pushups. When we say \u0027run,\u0027 you run. When we wake you at the crack of dawn, you\u0027ll be ready and in formation within seven minutes. \"We\u0027re going to test your will and your spirit. We\u0027re going to test you physically and mentally. You\u0027re going to hate and curse your instructors while you\u0027re going through it, and love us and feel like a stronger person in the end. Any questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my hand. When Liron points to me, I say, \"Do we get free time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" she answers curdy. \"Why are you here, Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo spend time with my boyfriend, so Israeli girls like you don\u0027t steal him away from me, I want to say. But instead I say, \"To feel what it\u0027s like to be an Israeli soldier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn instructor named Gili comes in and talks to us about the state of Israel. \"Israel has a population of about six million Jews,\" she explains. \"We are a minority in the Middle East. It\u0027s no secret we cannot afford to lose even one war. To do so might mean the end of the state of Israel. That\u0027s why every single Jewish Israeli citizen must serve in the military. Israeli Druze and Bedouins serve in our military as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next two hours, Liron and other instructors take turns teaching us. I haven\u0027t paid much attention to the other girls in my unit, but being in a small classroom gives me the opportunity to check them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the bus ride to the base, I learned that five of the girls are friends from New York. They all have straight brown hair and the same basic \"look.\" They\u0027re taking this whole boot camp thing seriously and are determined to be obedient soldiers. I swear these New York girls can\u0027t wait to get down and dirty in the Israeli dirt. I think they\u0027re under the impression that at the end of our military basic training program they\u0027ll be ready for the front lines of battle. I don\u0027t have the heart to tell them they\u0027ve got a demented view of reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have four girls from California. They\u0027re all really pretty and two of them are fakey-blond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0027s Tori, our resident bitch. She\u0027s a total loner, by choice. She rolls her eyes at everything, and makes snide comments to just about everyone on the trip. I think her goal in life is to insult every person she comes in contact with. Her hair is long and blond, but when she turns around and her hair parts you can see that underneath she has a sheath of black hair. It\u0027s totally two-tone, but I have no clue if she wants it that way or if it\u0027s a bad dye job. Either way, it\u0027s definitely unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the seven girls in our barracks are from different states scattered around the country, although two are actually from Canada and I want to laugh every time they say the word \"about\" because it comes out as \"ah-boot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now we\u0027re being dismissed from the classroom. How can I break it to Ronit that I\u0027m \"ah-boot\" to go search for my boyfriend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking the rules feels great while you\u0027re breaking them, but horrible while you\u0027re paying for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting free time here is proving to be nearly impossible. After our classroom discussion, we\u0027re led back to our bit-tan and are instructed to pick a bunk and unpack. This is also a bathroom break time, but I\u0027m not going in that place again until I absolutely have to. There really isn\u0027t unpacking to do because each of us only has a little cubby to put our stuff in--just big enough to fit my shampoo, conditioner, and makeup bag. I\u0027ll just have to live out of my suitcases while I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Jess, Miranda, and I got to the bittan late, Jess and I can\u0027t share a bunk. I sit on an unoccupied one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s mine,\" Tori says, standing over me. \"I called it first. You can have the top bunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around for an empty bottom bunk, but there aren\u0027t any left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine,\" I say to Tori, who seems pretty pleased to boss me around. I would argue that I didn\u0027t hear her \"call it first\" or that I\u0027m afraid of heights and I\u0027ll probably fall off the top bunk while I sleep, but all I want to do is find Avi. I couldn\u0027t care less about Tori and her bottom bunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I think free time has begun, it\u0027s time for the next activity. Ronit hands out pillows, sheets, and a very thin wool blanket. For the next hour, she teaches us how to make our beds. We have to keep unsheeting and re-sheeting until we get the A-okay from Ronit that we\u0027ve finally done it to IDF standards (picture tight hospital corners). I can tell you right now that making tight hospital corners on a top bunk is tons harder than on a bottom bunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bunk is two away from Miranda\u0027s and across from Jessica\u0027s. I can tell it\u0027ll be close to impossible to have private late-night chats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone line up outside!\" Ronit yells. \"Yala, zooz!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t exactly know what \"Yala, zooz means, but from her tone I guess it means \"Come on, hurry up.\" I have a feeling I\u0027ll be hearing those words a lot while I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess pulls me aside before we go. \"Switch bunks with me,\" she says. \"You want a bottom bunk, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s right by the door so you can get fresh air.\" Jess is already bringing her stuff over to my cubby and switching my stuff out. \"Just do it. We\u0027ve got to hurry and get out outside before they make us do pushups. I hate pushups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron and Ronit time how long it takes until we\u0027re all in formation outside. Ronit walks in front of us like a lion pacing in her cage. \"It took you fourteen minutes. I think that\u0027s the worst I\u0027ve ever seen! Next time,\" she says, \"you\u0027ll do it in half the time--seven minutes. And then we\u0027ll cut it to three. March in formation to the cheder ocheliot dinner! Ready?\" she barks out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must not expect us to respond, because immediately she starts chanting the small-yamean-smalls. We\u0027re all out of line and out of sequence, bumping into each other. Ronit stops us. She makes us go back to the barracks each time we screw up until we get it right. The guys, who have obviously mastered marching in formation, have been gawking at us the entire time from the entrance to the cheder ochel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve attempted to get there six times. We\u0027re all getting crabby and tired. The seventh time, we\u0027re almost there when I spot Avi. He\u0027s standing by the American guys, watching me. I get so excited and nervous to see him that I totally screw up and step right on the back of Tori\u0027s foot, so hard that her shoe comes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" Ronit says, then sighs in frustration. \"Okay, girls. Back to the bittan for another try!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTori grabs her shoe. \"What a spaz\" she mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she kidding me? \"Oh, like you\u0027re so perfect with your marching?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTori flips her fake blond hair over her shoulder. \"I\u0027ve been dancing since I was five. I know how to count off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t tell her that I\u0027ve been dancing since I was four. I want to talk to Avi before he\u0027s whisked off so I ignore her. We line up again, and this time I look at the back of Tori\u0027s head so I don\u0027t mess up. In the end, it takes us thirty-five minutes to walk the three minutes to the cheder ochel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn our way into the building, I look for Avi again. I spot him talking to other soldiers. While everyone rushes to stuff their faces with mediocre food, I walk up to my boyfriend. \"Can we go somewhere private?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You can\u0027t talk to your girlfriend alone? You can\u0027t kiss your girlfriend you haven\u0027t seen for five months?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If someone catches us--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go somewhere alone. For just a minute, Avi. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I even finish the word \"please,\" Avi takes my hand and quickly whisks me away to a private alcove on the side of another building without windows. My mom says rules are made to be broken... or at least stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach is in knots, and I tell myself not to be emotional. I\u0027m also very aware that we could be in big trouble if we\u0027re caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut looking at Avi\u0027s face brings me back to the first day I met him. He was working at the sheep pens on the moshav, lugging bales of hay. I was afraid of the huge herding dogs running toward me so I leaped into the pens for safety. Instead of landing on the soft hay, I landed on Avi. He broke my fall. When I opened my eyes, I was staring into the most mesmerizing eyes I\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing here with him, alone, makes me forget about rules and regulations. It\u0027s times like these I\u0027m happy that I live in the gray areas of life. Being with Avi makes everything that\u0027s crappy in my life bearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arms around his neck. This time he doesn\u0027t pull away. \"I missed you so much,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raises his hand to my cheek and brushes his fingers softly down my face. For such a tough guy, Avis touch has always been super gentle. \"I can\u0027t resist you,\" he says softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m relieved and excited when his lips touch mine. I wrap my arms around his waist and try to ignore the feel of his rifle against my fingers. \"When I urge him closer, our kiss gets more heated. As soon as his tongue touches mine, my insides feel like hot, molten lava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy emotions are running high and I know a tear has escaped from the corner of my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls away a little. \"Don\u0027t cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the back of my hand, I quickly wipe whatever tears have escaped. \"I\u0027m not,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates. \"We need to talk. Seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About you being here. You said you\u0027d be staying at the moshav.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to lie to him. What would be the point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to be with you. To see you. To spend time with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the military, Amy. I can\u0027t spend time with you here like we did last summer. I\u0027m a soldier now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now I\u0027m a soldier too. At least for a little while. And we\u0027re spending time together right now, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zeheruit Gefen,\" Nimrod calls out, starding me. \"Ata holech al chevel dok. n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sababa,\" Avi answers back, then says to me, \"I can\u0027t do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Nimrod just say?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said I should watch out because I\u0027m walking a thin line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimrod frowns at us. Avi and I both stay silent, ignoring the warning, until Nimrod shrugs and walks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can\u0027t you do?\" I finally answer. \"Be specific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi rakes his hand through his hair, even though in actuality he\u0027s just raking his hand over his growing-out buzz cut. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"I don\u0027t want you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my heart just dropped into the pit of my stomach. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound to our right makes Avi tense as he surveys the source of the noise. It\u0027s only an American guy from my unit on his way to the bathroom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-5.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
