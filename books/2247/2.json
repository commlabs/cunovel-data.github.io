He couldn\u0027t stand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster had a little sheen of sweat on his forehead. \"I use rodentia to symbolize the lower societal strata-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Squirrels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster said, \"It\u0027s really a metaphor for a much broader-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s squirrels, isn\u0027t it?\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your poem\u0027s about squirrels, Timmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego\u0027s face had purpled, his shoulders shaking with barely controlled laughter. He stuck the heel of his hand in his mouth to stifle himself. Others in the class giggled openly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan sifted the pile of poems, moved DelPrego\u0027s to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold Jenks was one tough nigger, and everybody knew it. You had to be tough to work for Red Zach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks liked to call himself the King of East St. Louis, but that was sort of a joke too many of the neighborhood folks took seriously. More accurately, he was king of about seven square blocks between the bus station and the Missouri State Welfare Offices. But everyone knew Jenks was Red Zach\u0027s boy. That made Jenks important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks and Spoon Oliver hung out in the alley near the bus station. They sipped beer and smoked and waited for something to happen. It was after midnight. When you worked for Red Zach, you didn\u0027t keep regular hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks\u0027s boy Spoon nudged Jenks in the ribs and pointed down the alley. \"Check it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome nigger coming down the alley, carrying big suitcases. Jenks watched a minute, puffed his cheap cigar, a Philly Blunt he bought at the convenience store along with a sixteen-ounce can of Bud Light in a little paper sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" Jenks drank his beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toll,\" Spoon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks shrugged. \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say we toll him. This our alley or ain\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ain\u0027t charged toll since we was sixteen,\" Jenks said. \"We work for Zach now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m cash short,\" Spoon said. \"I say we do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks sighed, tossed down the cigar stub, and stamped it out. \"Okay, but don\u0027t go all crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks backed up behind the Dumpster, gave the \"stay down\" motion to his partner Spoon on the other side of the alley. Let that nigger get closer, then we jack his ass good. Only I got to keep an eye on Spoon. He\u0027s over the edge lately. Jenks suspected his boy had developed a coke twitch, dipping into the merchandise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the victim got between them, Jenks and Oliver leapt. Poor nigger dropped the bags and tried to run, but Jenks had a fistful of his jacket, and Oliver tackled his legs. They all went down in a pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks saw the kid was about his age, maybe twenty-two. He yelled, but Jenks twisted, got on top of him. He punched down hard across his face, twice. A third time broke the kid\u0027s lip open, and dark blood smeared down his chin. Jenks let up when he saw the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver stuck a knife to the sucker\u0027s throat. \"Give it up, boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go,\" the kid said. \"Take the bags. I got money. Take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up.\" Jenks gut-punched the kid. He pulled the wallet out of the kid\u0027s jacket, counted the bills. \"Eighty fucking greenbacks. Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the kid up by the shirt. \"All you got is eighty fucking dollars, motherfucker. Shit. Not even worth jacking your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, nigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, shit,\" Spoon said. \"We got to kill this boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, no, I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said shut your cunt mouth.\" Jenks rapped him on the nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this boy,\" Spoon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks shook the boy by the shirt. \"You know us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?\" Harold pointed at Spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spoon Oliver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Jenks said. \"Who am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harold Jenks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sherman Ellis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He live three blocks over,\" Spoon said. \"Pappy in prison. Momma died of the cancer last year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna die now, Sherman Ellis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t say anything. I promise.\" He was shaking. Tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t take that chance,\" Jenks said. \"Nobody to cry for you anyway. All alone in the world. Say good night.\" This always scared them good. Jenks had even seen a few motherfuckers piss themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"W-wait,\" pleaded Sherman. \"I\u0027m leaving. What if I promise I\u0027m never c-coming back. Never returning to Missouri. That would be okay, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Spoon said. \"A motherfucker about to die will say any shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s t-true,\" Sherman said. \"I\u0027ve got a scholarship to Eastern Oklahoma. Grad school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The letter\u0027s in my pocket,\" Sherman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks pulled the letter out of Sherman\u0027s coat pocket. It had been folded into quarters. He opened it and read by the dim light of the streetlamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna be a poet?\" Jenks couldn\u0027t believe it. Of all the fucked-up things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\" Sherman\u0027s face contorted with anxiety. \"I\u0027ve worked hard. Straight A\u0027s in high school. I worked two jobs to get through Truman State. Please, brother. Not like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sherman talked, Jenks felt himself deflate. He let go of the kid\u0027s shirt. This nigger was on his way out. On his way to something better. He and Spoon always said that shit about killing. Kept the suckers scared. Make them keep their mouths shut. Hell, maybe they should let the kid go, give him his damn eighty dollars back. Maybe just this once-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon moved forward, stuck the knife into Sherman\u0027s chest, slammed it down to the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn!\" Jenks fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motherfucker,\" Spoon yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherman twitched, clawed at the knife still in his chest, arched his back, eyes open to the night sky. He worked his mouth, no words. A trickle of blood welled up over his lips, stained his teeth red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nigger thinks he can give us that brother shit,\" Spoon said. \"Who the fuck he think he is? He think he better than us. Fucking scholarship motherfucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, strained breath leaked out of Sherman, and he went slack. Steam floating up from his open mouth, drifting out of the alley like a soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\" Jenks stood, looked down at the body, and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon grabbed Sherman\u0027s bags. \"Come on, Harold. Let\u0027s go.\" Spoon jogged to the end of the alley where his Eldorado was parked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks stood a moment looking at Sherman, then followed Spoon. They put the bags in the trunk, then climbed in the front seat. Spoon started the engine, and they drove away slow without the lights on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three blocks, Spoon turned onto the big four-lane and switched on the lights. \"I\u0027m going to Wendy\u0027s. You want something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Jenks still had Sherman\u0027s wallet. He flipped it open, looked at Sherman\u0027s picture. He and Jenks were both very dark, same hair, same long nose and square chin. He was only a year older than Sherman. There was a Greyhound ticket folded into the wallet. Sherman had been on his way to the bus station. \"Nigger was gonna be a poet.\" He hadn\u0027t meant to say it out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck that,\" Spoon said. \"My cousin Jimmy busts rhymes at the Starlight Lounge Thursday nights. Don\u0027t need no bullshit college for that. You sure you don\u0027t want a Frosty or something?\" He turned into the Wendy\u0027s drive-thru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks put the wallet in his own pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You crazy?\" Spoon asked. \"Toss that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got an idea.\" The way Jenks said it frightened Spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now hold on, Harold,\" Spoon said. \"You know that ain\u0027t smart, keeping something like that. Cops hang a murder on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nigger, I said I got an idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Spoon shut up. He ordered a triple with fries and shut his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethree\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Morgan dismissed the class, stepped foot into the hall, and immediately saw Ginny the cub reporter waiting for him at the other end. She lifted her hand to wave, and Morgan turned, fast-walked around the opposite corner. He could hear her cloppity footfalls on the tile behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan zigzagged a labyrinth of office corridors, past a heretofore unseen set of rest rooms, a water fountain, some kind of tutoring room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of Ginny\u0027s blocky shoes pursued, dogged, relentless. Hath thou slain the jabberwock? Morgan scrambled. Looked side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe darted up and around, into the dark, dusty reaches of the third floor. The door was nailed shut, but the stairs kept going. Dry, wooden, creaking with each step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fourth floor. A fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many floors does this goddamn building have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan shoved open the fifth-floor door and found himself in a dim hall, murky with yellow light. Faded rectangles still remained where nameplates had been pried from office doors. He walked the hall, stale and silent like a ghost town. He stopped, cocked his ear down a cross hall. Listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was that? He strained to hear. Music. He walked toward it. A smell. Sickly sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the album now. Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School by Warren Zevon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho in God\u0027s name is up here? This floor had obviously been abandoned, light fixtures empty, no blinds on the windows, dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan glanced behind him. He\u0027d shaken off Ginny. He could find another stairway down and go home if he wanted to, or find his own office and hide. But the smell and the music drew him on, the nagging tickle of curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned down a long hall. The music came from a door at the far end, and the smell grew stronger as Morgan approached. Yellowing pages had been taped to the door: news articles, poems, Far Side and Bloom County cartoons. Also a class schedule and office hours for fall semester 1983.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan lifted his fist to knock, stopped, tried the knob. It turned. He very slowly pushed open the door and went in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office was long and dark, the music loud. The room was thick with smoke. Bookshelves lined with assorted tomes from floor to ceiling. Near the window sat a large brown globe of the world like it had fallen there from orbit, more books stacked around it like the edges of an impact crater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black-and-white poster of Freud on the wall. Some wag had drawn a penis head at the tip of his cigar with a red Magic Marker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan waved at the smoke, coughed. This smoke seemed familiar. He inhaled deeply, tried to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGanja.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music stopped abruptly, and a voice from the dark recesses of the office said, \"Close the damn door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan jumped. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re letting the smoke out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan shut the door behind him, peered into the haze. \"Who is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, as if from a long way off, from the other side of a Scottish moor, a reedy, bearded man, round spectacles, pointed frame draped in threadbare tweed, emerged from the smoke like he was walking out of an Arthur Conan Doyle mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his gnarled hands he held a bong the size of a clarinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man exhaled as he spoke, eyes narrowed to dreamy slits. \"I\u0027m Professor Valentine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan\u0027s jaw dropped. \"Valentine? Tad Valentine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d gone on sabbatical.\" Valentine was the professor Morgan had been hired to replace for a year, but it was Morgan\u0027s understanding the old Pulitzer Prize-winning poet had rented a studio in Prague. It seemed unlikely to find the man smoking weed from a giant bong in a remote office on an abandoned floor of Albatross Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this wasn\u0027t Valentine. Maybe it was an old derelict junkie who\u0027d wandered in from the cold. Morgan could think of no tactful way to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, please. Have a seat,\" Valentine said. \"Make yourself at home. I haven\u0027t had visitors since... well, I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ve ever had any. Not since moving up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan cast about the room. No chairs. He remained standing, hands folded demurely in front of him. \"Uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want a hit?\" Valentine offered him the bong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a cop, are you?\" Valentine pinned Morgan with wild eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, I... Um...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine frowned. \"Is there something wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Jay Morgan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s hardly your fault, is it?\" Valentine mouthed the bong like he was in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Morgan said. \"I mean, I\u0027m the one-year-contract professor teaching your classes. Why aren\u0027t you in Prague?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Prague.\" Hazy nostalgia washed over Valentine. His eyes narrowed to slits, and he looked off into the dreamy distance. \"Yes, I had a glorious few months there, and this wonderful studio apartment overlooking the Charles Bridge.\" He shrugged. \"I got kicked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of the apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of the Czech Republic,\" Valentine said. \"Some leftover Iron Curtain nonsense. All ancient history really, but these chaps evidently have a long memory.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-2.html","bookId":2247,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM"}
