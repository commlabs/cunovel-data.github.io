I know you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did exactly that. Once he calmed down, she explained that she was still going to run her company with Jordan. \"Please don\u0027t tell Phillips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to notice when you keep coming to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to gloat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The working conditions will have to change, of course.
