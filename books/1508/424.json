It was unknown when, but a light black fog began to cover his face, making it difficult for others to see him. In this black fog, there was only a pair of vibrant red eyes that shined through. A cold light continuously flashed out from these eyes, causing anyone who dared to glance at them to feel a deep despairing fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eKa ka ka!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOuyang Shenxiu gripped his fists together, and a purple flame ignited on his hands; this was similar to the Purple Flame Bone Lance that Ouyang Guang had used earlier.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“What is going on?

Those of the Acacia Faction used a sword. If a sword user were to use their fists, their power would naturally weaken by a great deal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn conclusion, Ouyang Shenxiu still feared Divine Phoenix Island. Since he clearly knew that he couldn’t kill Lin Ming without provoking a calamity upon himself, he might as well not use his sword and only use his fists and sword fingers. Everyone could see this modest and humble act.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf he easily defeated Lin Ming without using his sword, he would be able to display his own style and aura as a master. No one would say that he was a senior that was bullying the weak and the young, but instead would say the his strength was vast and fathomless.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis was Ouyang Shenxiu’s plan.

Sovereign Ouyang is going easy on Lin Ming, this is the Sovereign’s grace. Even in this situation, he is still staying his hand. I can only hope that Lin Ming knows what’s good for him and doesn’t ignore this kindness, otherwise the Sovereign will teach him a harsh lesson.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“So it’s like this!

Within the entire Acacia Faction, there was only a single person who had practiced the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ to the limit of the seventh layer.

Ouyang Shenxiu felt as if his sword had cut across a mountain. A chaotic and uncontrollable flux of energy broke into his body, causing his blood to stop.

Although it had seemed like Lin Ming had suppressed Ouyang Shenxiu with his attack, the truth was that Ouyang Shenxiu had taken great care to not use a weapon, and also held back in his attack. Thus, this was the result, and that was why to this second-grade sect Elder, it seemed as if Lin Ming’s strength was almost equal to that of Ouyang Shenxiu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“How could that be possible? Sovereign Ouyang used less than half his strength in that last move!” An Acacia Faction disciple stubbornly said. In their eyes, Ouyang Shenxiu was an invincible existence. “Just wait to see our Sovereign use the seventh layer of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’. The world itself will change.

But, the disciples of the smaller sects didn’t quite believe this; it was obvious from their eyes that were filled with suspicious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt this time on the square, Lin Ming gave off a feeling like he was an ocean, an unfathomable and inestimable force. Perhaps Ouyang Shenxiu’s seventh layer of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ was incomparable in power, but who knew what other secret cards Lin Ming had hidden up his sleeve?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSince he had the confidence to force his way into the Seven Profound Valleys and take Ouyang Boyan’s life, his strength might even be beyond this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOuyang Shenxiu was deeply ashamed. Before, he had only used his sword fingers, but not only was he not able to suppress Lin Ming in the first move, but he was actually forced by Lin Ming to use his sword and even forced to retreat into the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis boy’s strength was at least equal to someone at the top of the late Xiantian realm.

His own cultivation was at the extreme Xiantian realm. If a late Houtian boy were to have the same level of strength as him, then that would simply be too pitiful to bear!

Before, he had said that after three moves, he would drop all matters regardless of life or death. But, if he couldn’t even manage to harm a single hair on Lin Ming after three moves, and was also forced back because of a counterattack, he would completely lose any face he had.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis boy!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOuyang Shenxiu’s eyes gradually turned ice cold. He extended his longsword and then gave a loud shout. With a whistling sound, Ouyang Shenxiu’s longsword suddenly kindled to life with purple flames. A moment later, these purple flames shrank, manifesting into reality and attaching onto the sword. These purple flames turned into a thin layer of purple crystal. This sword had become an amethyst blade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“That’s the Purple Flame Crystal Conversion!” An Acacia Faction disciple shouted from a small island.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Purple Flame Crystal Conversion was a magic technique that was only found within the seventh layer of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’. Once one cultivated the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ to the seventh layer, they would have long lasting youth, and their Yang essence wouldn’t dissipate. Although it was impossible to extend one’s life beyond what was allowed by their cultivation, just that fact that their Yang essence wouldn’t fade was already a great temptation for many Acacia Faction disciples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCurrently, within the entire Acacia Faction, only Ouyang Shenxiu had cultivated the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ to the peak of the seventh layer. This was also the reason that Ouyang Shenxiu, although he was 300 to 400 years old, still appeared to resemble an attractive middle-aged man.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“The Sovereign used the Purple Flame Crystal Conversion from the seventh layer of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ cultivation method.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs this amethyst sword appeared, many Acacia Faction disciples felt proud and happy.

As he looked at the amethyst sword in Ouyang Shenxiu’s hand, he was able to see that the purple flames’ dark Yin energy had disappeared, and instead turned into pure energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“The highest level of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ can force the dark Yin energy to return to its natural state?

Before this, he had repeatedly saved his strength, and it was all for this moment. Lin Ming’s power was very explosive, but it was simply unable to last for an extended period of time. In the end, his cultivation was simply too insufficient. The true essence in his dantian and tempered marrow combined was still far inferior in thickness to that of an extreme Xiantian master. He had to ensure that he would be at his best condition when facing Ouyang Shenxiu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe purple lights gathered from all over towards Ouyang Shenxiu’s sword. The entire blade radiated a dazzling purple light, and ghostly cries emitted from it. On Ouyang Shenxiu’s body, dozens of purple beams of light shot into the sky. All of these light beams were spurred by Ouyang Shenxiu’s sword, and then pierced towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSound seemed to disappear.

This Ouyang Shenxiu has not only cultivated the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ to the limit, but he also has such a deep and profound understanding into swordsmanship. I wonder just how Lin Ming will defend against this!
