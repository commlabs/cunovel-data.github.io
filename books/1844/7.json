Iain couldn\u0027t help but notice… and appreciate the gentle sway of her hips. There was such grace in her every movement. Aye, she was beautiful, all right. Her eyes were the prettiest violet he\u0027d ever seen, but it was the wonderful sound of her laughter that had truly affected him. It was filled with such joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain had already made the decision to force the woman to come home with him, a decision he hadn\u0027t shared with his companions. When the time came, they would do what he ordered. Lady Judith had certainly surprised him, though. She was a woman of her word. And yet she was English. He shook his head over the contradiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you make of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain\u0027s second cousin, Gowrie, asked that question. He stared after the Englishwoman while he scratched his dark beard in a rhythmic motion, as if that repetitive action might help him come to some important conclusion. \"She\u0027s a pretty little thing, isn\u0027t she? I\u0027m thinking I\u0027m warming to the lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking you talk too much,\" Alex muttered. \"Hell, Gowrie, you warm to anything wearing a skirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowrie smiled. He wasn\u0027t the least offended by his friend\u0027s insulting remarks. \"She\u0027s keeping her word to our Frances Catherine,\" he said. \"And that\u0027s the only reason I\u0027d ever warm to an Englishwoman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain had heard enough of the idle chatter. He was in a hurry to get started. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here,\" he ordered. \"I can\u0027t breathe when I\u0027m in England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other warriors were in full agreement. Iain turned in his saddle to look at Brodick. \"She\u0027ll ride with you,\" he said. \"Tie her satchel behind your saddle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond-haired warrior shook his head. \"You ask too much, Iain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not asking,\" Iain countered, his voice as hard as sleet. \"I\u0027m giving you an order. Now try telling me no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick backed away from the threat. \"Hell,\" he muttered. \"As you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can ride with me,\" Gowrie suggested. \"I won\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain turned to glare at the soldier. \"Aye, you won\u0027t mind. You aren\u0027t touching her, either, Gowrie. Not now, not ever. Understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t wait for Gowrie\u0027s agreement, but turned his gaze back to Brodick. \"Move,\" he commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith had just mounted her steed when the warrior reached her side. \"You\u0027re riding with me,\" he announced. He paused when he saw the number of baggages tied on the mount\u0027s back. Then he shook his head. \"You\u0027ll have to leave—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never got to finish his explanation. \"Thank you so much for offering, sir, but there really isn\u0027t any need for me to ride with you. My mare\u0027s quite strong. She\u0027s certainly fit enough for this journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick wasn\u0027t accustomed to being contradicted by a woman. He didn\u0027t know how to proceed. He started to reach for her, then stopped in mid action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain noticed the soldier\u0027s hesitation. Then Brodick turned to look at him and he saw the confusion in his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s being difficult,\" Alex muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, she is,\" Gowrie agreed with a chuckle. \"I was wrong, Alex. She isn\u0027t pretty. She\u0027s damn beautiful.\" Alex nodded. \"Aye, she is,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you look at Brodick?\" Gowrie said then. \"If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d guess he was about to swoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex found that remark vastly amusing. Iain shook his head and nudged his mount forward. Judith hadn\u0027t noticed Brodick\u0027s discomfort. She was occupied smoothing her skirts over her ankles. She adjusted the heavy cloak over her shoulders, tied the black cord into a bow, and finally reached for the reins Paul was patiently holding for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain motioned Brodick out of the way, then edged his mount closer to Judith\u0027s side. \"You may take only one bag with you, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice didn\u0027t suggest she argue with him. \"I\u0027m taking every one of them,\" she countered. \"Most are presents I\u0027ve made for Frances Catherine and the baby, and I\u0027m not about to leave them behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she was acting very courageously, considering the fact that the huge warrior was trying to glare her soul right out of her body. It was apparent he liked getting his own way. She took a quick breath, then added, \"I don\u0027t wish to ride with that young man, either. My horse will carry me just as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything for a long minute. She was matching him frown for frown, too, until he pulled out his sword from the sheath at his side. She let out a little gasp then. Before she could move out of his path, he\u0027d raised the sword, shifted his position in his saddle, and then used the blade to slice through the ropes holding her precious baggage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was pounding inside her chest. She calmed down when he put his sword away. He motioned for his friends to come forward, and then ordered them to each take one of her satchels. Judith didn\u0027t say a word while the disgruntled-looking soldiers secured her baggage behind their saddles, but she let out another startled gasp when the leader tried to snatch her out of her saddle. She slapped his hands away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a puny defense against such a big man, and it was obvious to her that he was vastly amused by her action, too. The sparkle in his eyes said as much. \"It will be a hard ride up the mountains, lass, and it would serve you better if you rode with one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. The idea of being so close to the handsome man wasn\u0027t actually displeasing, but she didn\u0027t want him to think of her as inferior. She\u0027d had enough of that in the past to last her a lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very fit for this journey,\" she boasted. \"You needn\u0027t worry about me keeping up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain held his exasperation. \"There will also be times when we\u0027ll have to ride through hostile territory,\" he patiently explained. \"Our mounts are trained to be quiet—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My horse will be just as quiet,\" she interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly smiled at her. \"Will she be as quiet as you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe immediately nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a sigh. \"I suspected as much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t realize he\u0027d given her an insult until he reached for her again. He didn\u0027t give her time to push his hands away, either. The man was determined, all right. He wasn\u0027t overly gentle when he lifted her from her saddle and settled her on his lap. He hadn\u0027t considered the indecency of the position. Her legs straddled his saddle in just the same way a man\u0027s would when he was riding, and if that wasn\u0027t an embarrassment, the fact that the backs of her thighs were plastered on top of his certainly was. She could feel her face turning pink with a blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let her correct the shameful position. His left arm was tightly wrapped around her waist. She couldn\u0027t move at all, but she could breathe, and she guessed that would have to be enough. Judith waved farewell to the servants watching the spectacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a little irritated with the warrior for using such high-handed tactics to get his way. She still noticed how warm she was feeling in his arms, though. She noticed his scent, too, and found the faint masculine aroma extremely pleasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith leaned back against his chest. The top of her head was just below his chin. She didn\u0027t try to look up at him when she asked him to give her his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bumped his chin when she nodded to let him know she\u0027d heard his gruffly whispered reply. \"How are you related to Frances Catherine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her husband is my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d crossed the drawbridge now and were climbing the hill adjacent to the family cemetery. \"And his name is Patrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was apparent he wasn\u0027t in the mood to talk. Judith pulled away from him and turned to look at him. He was staring straight ahead, ignoring her. \"I\u0027ve only one more question to ask you, Iain,\" she said. \"Then I promise to leave you to your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally looked down at her. Judith\u0027s breath caught in her throat. Dear Lord, he had beautiful eyes. It was a mistake, asking him to give her his full attention, she decided, because his penetrating gaze robbed her of her concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was perfectly safe to find him attractive, she decided. Nothing could ever come of it, of course. She was going to his home, yes, but she was going to be an outsider, a guest. Once there, he probably wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with her, or she with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she was English. No, nothing could ever come from this harmless attraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you married?\" She\u0027d blurted out that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed more surprised than he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what to make of that. She\u0027d asked her question and now he could ignore her. The problem, unfortunately, was that he couldn\u0027t take his gaze off her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve one more question to ask you,\" she whispered. \"Then I\u0027ll leave you to your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared into each other\u0027s eyes a long minute. \"What is this question you wish to ask me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was whisper soft. It felt like a caress to her. That reaction confused her and she had to take her gaze away from the handsome devil so she could sort out this bizarre reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed her hesitation. \"This question of yours must not be very important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it is important,\" she countered. She paused another minute while she tried to remember what the question was. She stared at his chin so she could concentrate. \"Now I remember,\" she announced with a smile. \"Is Patrick kind to Frances Catherine? Does he treat her well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine he\u0027s kind to her,\" he answered with a shrug. Almost as an afterthought he added, \"He would never beat her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up into his eyes so he could see her amusement over that comment. \"I already knew he wouldn\u0027t beat her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he ever raised a hand against her, she\u0027d run away from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such an outrageous thing to say, Iain didn\u0027t know how to respond. He quickly regained his wits. \"And where would she run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she\u0027d sounded so sincere, he knew she believed what she\u0027d just told him. Iain had never heard of anything so preposterous. A wife simply did not leave her husband, no matter what the reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of the Maitlands would ever touch a woman in anger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain, what do you make of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shouted that question, interrupting their discussion. Judith turned just in time to see the warrior motion to the grave she\u0027d destroyed the evening before. She immediately turned her gaze to the line of trees at the top of the ridge. Iain felt her tense in his arms. \"Do you know who did this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered, her voice whisper soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does the grave—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t let him finish. \"It was my father\u0027s grave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d reached Alex\u0027s side when she made that remark. The green-eyed warrior glanced over at Iain, then back to Judith. \"Would you like us to put the headstone back before we go, lass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I\u0027d only have to knock it down again if you did, but I do thank you for offering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex couldn\u0027t hide his astonishment. \"Are you telling us you did this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a hint of embarrassment on her face when she answered him. \"Yes, I did this. It took me a good hour. The ground was as hard as rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scot looked appalled. Then Iain drew her attention. He nudged her face up to his with the back of his thumb. \"Why would you do such a thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \"It seemed appropriate at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. The atrocity she\u0027d just admitted to seemed completely out of character with what he\u0027d already surmised about her. He\u0027d guessed she was a sweet-tempered, innocent woman. Stubborn, too. The way she\u0027d argued over riding her own mount indicated that flaw. Still, she didn\u0027t seem the type of woman who would desecrate holy ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your father\u0027s grave?\" he asked again, determined to get to the bottom of this intriguing puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. She let out a little sigh. \"You needn\u0027t be concerned about this. The grave\u0027s empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to explain further. He decided not to prod. She\u0027d gone completely rigid in his arms. It was obvious the topic was distressing to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain motioned for Alex to take the lead again, then nudged his mount into line behind him. Once the cemetery was well behind them, Judith visibly relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t speak again until the sun was setting and it was time to make camp for the night. They\u0027d ridden long hours. The men were in a much more jovial mood now that they\u0027d crossed the border and were once again back in Scotland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith was exhausted by the time they finally stopped. Iain noticed when he helped her dismount. She could barely stand up on her own. His hands spanned her waist to hold her steady until she regained the strength in her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her trembling. He stared at the top of her head while she stared at the ground. Since she didn\u0027t mention her obvious problem, he didn\u0027t, either. She was holding on to his arms, but as soon as she let go, he released his grip on her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe immediately turned to his stallion. She slowly made her way around his horse and continued on toward the stream she\u0027d glimpsed halfway hidden behind the line of trees adjacent to the small clearing. Iain watched her walk away and was again struck by her regal bearing. She moved like a princess, he thought to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, she really was a beauty. Damn innocent, too. The way she blushed over every little thing was telling. She was enchanting, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one could get to his heart. Iain was so stunned by that sudden realization, he almost blanched. He continued to stare at the trees where Judith had disappeared, but he was frowning now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s got you so riled?\" Alex asked from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain rested his arm on the saddle of his mount. \"Foolish thoughts,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend glanced over to the trees where Judith had gone, then turned back to Iain. \"Foolish thoughts about a beautiful Englishwoman, perchance?\" Iain shrugged. \"Perhaps,\" he allowed. Alex knew better than to pursue the topic. His laird didn\u0027t look at all happy over his confession. \"It\u0027s going to be a long journey home,\" he predicted with a sigh before turning back to take care of his own steed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith had been able to maintain her dignified walk until she was safely hidden by the trees. Then she all but doubled over and grabbed hold of her lower back. Lord, she ached. Her backside and thighs felt as though someone had taken a whip to her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-7.html","bookId":1844,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM"}
