Juno, repairing to the assembly of the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches before him with his aegis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,\n\u003cbr\u003e And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:\n\u003cbr\u003e Then stopp\u0027d and panted, where the chariots lie\n\u003cbr\u003e Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile, awaken\u0027d from his dream of love,\n\u003cbr\u003e On Ida\u0027s summit sat imperial Jove:\n\u003cbr\u003e Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,\n\u003cbr\u003e There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;\n\u003cbr\u003e These proud in arms, those scatter\u0027d o\u0027er the plain\n\u003cbr\u003e And, \u0027midst the war, the monarch of the main.\n\u003cbr\u003e Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,\n\u003cbr\u003e (His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)\n\u003cbr\u003e Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,\n\u003cbr\u003e His senses wandering to the verge of death.\n\u003cbr\u003e The god beheld him with a pitying look,\n\u003cbr\u003e And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,\n\u003cbr\u003e For ever studious in promoting ill!\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,\n\u003cbr\u003e And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.\n\u003cbr\u003e Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand\n\u003cbr\u003e Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 269]\n\u003cbr\u003e Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix\u0027d on high,\n\u003cbr\u003e From the vast concave of the spangled sky,\n\u003cbr\u003e I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,\n\u003cbr\u003e And all the raging gods opposed in vain?\n\u003cbr\u003e Headlong I hurl\u0027d them from the Olympian hall,\n\u003cbr\u003e Stunn\u0027d in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.\n\u003cbr\u003e For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,\n\u003cbr\u003e Nor seem\u0027d the vengeance worthy such a son:\n\u003cbr\u003e When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss\u0027d\n\u003cbr\u003e The shipwreck\u0027d hero on the Coan coast,\n\u003cbr\u003e Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,\n\u003cbr\u003e And sent to Argos, and his native shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,\n\u003cbr\u003e Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;\n\u003cbr\u003e Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn\u0027d,\n\u003cbr\u003e And, trembling, these submissive words return\u0027d:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"By every oath that powers immortal ties,\n\u003cbr\u003e The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;\n\u003cbr\u003e By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow\n\u003cbr\u003e Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;\n\u003cbr\u003e By the dread honours of thy sacred head,\n\u003cbr\u003e And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!\n\u003cbr\u003e Not by my arts the ruler of the main\n\u003cbr\u003e Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:\n\u003cbr\u003e By his own ardour, his own pity sway\u0027d,\n\u003cbr\u003e To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey\u0027d:\n\u003cbr\u003e Else had thy Juno better counsels given,\n\u003cbr\u003e And taught submission to the sire of heaven.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Think\u0027st thou with me?
