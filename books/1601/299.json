He finally let everything out, every bit of rage at Slayer, every bit of pain at the deaths of his family—pressures which had been growing inside him unnoticed for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let it out. Light, he let it out. As he had on that terrible night when he’d killed those Whitecloaks. Ever since then, he’d clamped a firm grip on himself and his emotions. Just as Master Luhhan had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see it now, in a frozen moment. Gentle Perrin, always afraid of hurting someone. A blacksmith who had learned control. He had rarely let himself strike with all of his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis day, he took the leash off the wolf. It had never belonged there anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm conformed to his rage. Perrin didn’t try to keep it back. Why would he? It matched his emotions perfectly. The fall of his hammer was like claps of thunder, the flashing of his eyes like lightning bolts. Wolves howled alongside the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer tried to fight back. He jumped, he shifted, he stabbed. Each time, Perrin was there. Jumping at him as a wolf, swinging at him as a man, buffeting him like the tempest itself. Slayer got a wild look in his eyes. He raised a shield, trying to put it between himself and Perrin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin attacked. Without thought, now, he became instinct only. Perrin roared, smashing his hammer into that shield time and time again. Driving Slayer before him. Beating the shield like a stubborn length of iron. Pounding away his anger, his fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis last blow threw Slayer back and flung the shield from the man’s hands, sending it spinning a hundred feet in the air. Slayer hit the valley floor and rolled, gasping. He came to rest in the middle of the battlefield, shadowy figures rising all around him and dying as they fought in the real world. He looked at Perrin with panic, then vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin sent himself into the waking world to follow. He appeared amid the battle, Aiel against Trollocs in a furious fight. The winds were surprisingly strong on this side, and black clouds spun above Shayol Ghul, which rose like a crooked finger into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearby Aiel barely took time to notice him. The bodies of Trollocs and humans lay in heaps across the battlefield, and the place stank of death. The ground had once been dusty here, but now it churned with mud made from the blood of the fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer pushed through a group of Aiel nearby, growling, slashing with his long knife. He didn’t look back—and it didn’t seem that he knew Perrin had followed him into the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new wave of Shadowspawn pushed in off the slope, out of a silvery white mist. Their skin looked strange, pocked with holes, their eyes milky white. Perrin ignored these and barreled after Slayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung Bull! Wolves. The Shadowbrothers are here! We fight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkhounds. Wolves hated all Shadowspawn; an entire pack would die pulling down a Myrddraal. But Darkhounds they feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin looked around to spot the creatures. Ordinary men could not fight Darkhounds, whose mere saliva was death. Nearby, the human forces broke before a tide of black wolves the size of horses. The Wild Hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight! Those Darkhounds were enormous. Scores of the jet black, corrupted wolves ripped through the defensive lines, throwing Tairen and Domani soldiers about as if they were rag dolls. Wolves attacked the Darkhounds, but in vain. They screamed and howled and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin raised his voice alongside their cries of death, a ragged yell of rage. For the moment, he could not help. His instincts and passions drove him. Slayer. He had to defeat Slayer. If Perrin did not stop Slayer, the man would shift to the World of Dreams and kill Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin turned and ran through the fighting armies, chasing after the distant figure ahead. Slayer had gained a lead by Perrin’s distraction, but the man had slowed a little. He had not yet realized that Perrin could leave the World of Dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Slayer stopped and inspected the battlefield. He glanced back and saw Perrin—then his eyes widened. Perrin couldn’t hear his words over the din, but could read Slayer’s lips as he whispered, \"No. No, it can’t be\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Perrin thought. I can follow you now, wherever you run. This is a hunt. You, finally, are the prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer vanished, and Perrin shifted into the wolf dream after him. The people fighting around him became patterns in the dust, exploding and reforming. Slayer yelled in fright at seeing him, then shifted back into the waking world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin did likewise. He could smell Slayer’s trail. Slick with sweat, panicked. To the dream, then to the waking world again. In the dream, Perrin ran on four legs, as Young Bull. In the waking world, he was Perrin, hammer held aloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted back and forth between the two as frequently as he blinked, chasing Slayer. When he hit a patch of fighting bodies, he would jump into the wolf dream and crash through the figures made of sand and blown dust, then shift back into the waking world to keep on the trail. The shifting started to happen so quickly, he flickered between the two with each heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Perrin raised his hammer, leaping off a small ridge after the scrambling form ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Young Bull howled, summoning the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Perrin was close now. Only a few steps behind. Slayer’s odor was pungent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. The spirits of wolves appeared around Young Bull, howling their thirst for the hunt. Never had a prey deserved it more. Never had a prey done more damage to the packs. Never had a man been more feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Slayer stumbled. He twisted as he fell, sending himself to the wolf dream by reflex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Perrin swung Mah’alleinir; emblazoned with the leaping wolf. He who soars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Young Bull leaped for the throat of the killer of his brothers. Slayer fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hammer connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about this place, this moment, sent Perrin and Slayer into a spiraling series of flickers between worlds. Back and forth, back and forth, flashes of moments and thoughts. Flicker. Flicker. Flicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen died around them. Some of dust, some of flesh. Their world, alongside shadows of other worlds. Men in strange clothing and armor, fighting beasts of all shapes and sizes. Moments where the Aiel became Seanchan, who became something between the two, with spears and light eyes but helmets shaped like monstrous insects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of those moments, in all of those places, Perrin’s hammer struck and Young Bull’s fangs grabbed Slayer by the neck. He tasted the salty warmth of Slayer’s blood in his mouth. He felt the hammer vibrate as it hit, and he heard bones crack. The worlds flashed \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-299.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
