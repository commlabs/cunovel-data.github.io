They promised to keep an eye on G. K.’s house for a few days, but I knew that wouldn’t amount to much more than watching it when they drove past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look like hell,” G. K. said when they left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t feel much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took me by the hand and led me to the bathroom and turned on the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire left side of my face was bright red and purple and swollen, including my ear. My eye was little more than a slit, and there was a visible knot on my forehead. Touching anything caused red explosions between my eyes. I lifted my shirt. My back on the right side of my spinal cord was the same color as my face—the man must have broken a thousand blood vessels. In a couple of days I was going to be just one giant black and blue bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll get ice,” G. K. said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later I was sitting on her sofa, an ice pack pressed against my kidney. I held another against my face. “Thirty minutes on, thirty minutes off, repeat as needed,” my hockey coach once told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m impressed,” G. K. said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By what? That I can take such an awful beating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you can take such an awful beating and then come rushing to my rescue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting in a stuffed chair across from me, her feet again tucked beneath her. She was nursing what looked like a vodka and orange juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you had answered your phone I might not have,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet you did come. Beat up like you were, all you could think of was me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a helluva guy. Ask anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see that for myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what happened to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG. K. took a long sip of her drink. “I took a shower when I came home from work—was taking a shower.” She took another sip. “A lukewarm shower because it’s been so hot. I was washing my hair, and I heard a pounding. I stopped and listened. The pounding stopped, and then it started again, and I . . . I left the bathroom. The upstairs bathroom. I threw on a nightshirt and came downstairs. The pounding was coming from my front door, and I looked through the peek hole and I saw him. He was—he looked awful. Frightening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said, and shifted the ice pack to my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shouted through the door—no way I was going to open the door. I asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to see me. I asked him who he was. He didn’t answer, just kept pounding on the door. I told him to leave or I would call the police, and the pounding stopped. I went to my window”—she gestured with the glass at the plywood—“and looked out. He was watching me and smiling, and I realized that the nightshirt—I was still wet from the shower and the nightshirt was clinging to me and he could see my body outlined in the shirt, he could see . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG. K. took another long pull of her drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said things to me. Vile things. And I . . . I just stood there listening. I couldn’t move. I don’t know why. I just. . . Then he shouted that I was to stay away from Merodie Davies or he would come back and he and I, we would have a party. He said he might come back anyway. That was when my neighbor came out of his house. When the man saw my neighbor, he picked up a planter I had outside my front door and threw it through the window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, the planter, the glass—I wasn’t hurt. But it made me—That’s when I called the police and ran upstairs to put on clothes. He was gone by the time I came down again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s over now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s not,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you were going to say that. So we’re still on the case, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course we are. Aren’t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are if you say so. Just tell me one thing. Is it you talking or Mr. Muehlenhaus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re old friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG. K. finished her drink and made another. She had offered me one before, but I had turned it down. Mixing alcohol with a possible concussion didn’t seem like a good idea. When she returned to her chair, she said, “Mr. Muehlenhaus told me to contact you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s complicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, try to make it simple. I have a headache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG. K. drank more orange juice and vodka. “I became involved because I was Merodie Davies’s attorney when she was busted for the discon. To be honest, I was going to blow her off. I didn’t owe Merodie anything. Then Mr. Muehlenhaus called. I don’t know who brought him into it or why. I think it might have been Rollie Briggs, but that’s just a guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rollie Briggs,” I said. “He’s the assistant county attorney in Anoka County under David Tuseman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-53.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
