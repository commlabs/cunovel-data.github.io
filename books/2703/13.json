Stepping in reverse away from them, I refused to even consider the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she grew fed up and scowled at me. “Come on, Zo. You left home and came to me so you could finally live a little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I’d come here to save her life. But I winced with apology anyway, because I hated to disappoint her. “I’m sorry. I just...I can’t wear those.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora held up a hand. “Okay, fine. It’s still too soon for you. I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she thought I’d ever wear anything that revealing, she was nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew worried over just how much she’d changed this last year. Cursing and drinking and skimpy clothes. Those things hadn’t been Cora a year ago, and she knew they weren’t me now. So what had caused such a transformation? And why was she trying to change me too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, what exactly had I gotten myself into by coming here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora wrangled me into one of her tight tees. It was a plain gray V-neck but hugged my breasts like a second skin and was short enough to expose my navel with every other move I made. The shorts were indecently short and just as tight. Then she put me in ankle socks and white sneakers. Compared to the swimsuit she’d put on—a contraption of hot pink dental floss attached to three miniature scraps of cloth—I looked like a nun who was covered from neck to toe, but I still felt majorly exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter slopping my hair into a quick, high ponytail, Cora stepped back and clapped happily. “Ooh, this might even be better. You look like an adorable virgin, ripe for the plucking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw fell open as my face heated. “I cannot believe you just said that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. “Oh, Zoey, I’ve forgotten how completely naive you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated that word, almost as much as I hated being that word. And she knew it. Swallowing down my irritation that she would purposely and so coldly use it against me, I shied back and cleared my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, only a year ago you were just as innocent,” I said, hoping to make her remember, to draw out the friend I once had. But seriously, what kind of wild experiences had Quinn Hamilton given my best friend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed in my face. “Isn’t it awful how stupid I was? But that feels like a lifetime ago, thank God. Don’t you worry about it, hon. A few months here will help draw out your courage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourage for what, I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamn dialysis,” Cora muttered as she studied herself in the full-length mirror, turning from side to side. “It’s gotten me way too pale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought she looked extra tan, but I had a feeling saying so would annoy her, so I just sat on her bed and waited for her to stop degrading herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another minute of frowning and muttering, she met my gaze in the mirror. “Do you think this will actually look as good once it gets wet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face at it, thinking it’d probably disintegrate and fall off the second she got spray back from a water hose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read my expression and groaned. “You’re right. I should wear the blue one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she peeled off the pink top, I glanced at my wristwatch. We really needed to get going; the fundraiser was starting in five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll wait for you in the front room,” I said just as a knock came at our front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Cora, not at all feeling as if this was enough my home to be answering any doors yet. But she was too busy wiggling the pink bikini bottoms out of her butt crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t a sight I’d ever be able to un-see, so I motioned toward the doorway. “I’ll just...I’ll get the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t even pretend to hear me, so I hurried down the hall and checked the peek hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach instantly knotted with tension. What the heck was Cora’s too-gorgeous-to-be-real boyfriend doing here? I’d refused to think about him all day, because just remembering those awkward moments we’d had alone when Cora had been passed out between us made me hot and nervous all in one confusing ball. I swear, my hand still tingled from where I’d had to bury it in his pocket to fetch the apartment key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, he’d a really warm, rock hard thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down the hall toward Cora’s room, but she was nowhere in sight. Hesitating, I finally opened the door and peeked out at him. He startled a little when our gazes met, letting me know he’d been expecting her. Once he recovered, his blue eyes warmed with greeting and he smiled, flashing a deep dimple in the left side of his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, he just had to have a dimple, didn’t he? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-13.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
