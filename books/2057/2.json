But that didn\u0027t mean I wanted to go curling with them, and there was always a danger that if Jerome was in the right mood, he might decide to make this temporary assignment a permanent one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think he would, though. Underneath all the gruffness, Jerome liked me-inasmuch as a demon could truly like anyone. Admittedly, he\u0027d liked me a little less since Seth had turned my life upside down last fall, but when I wasn\u0027t sporting massive attitude, I think I amused Jerome. Amusing things are few in the face of eternity, so hopefully that would be enough to ensure my job security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Belltown and headed over to Queen Anne, another Seattle neighborhood. I both lived and worked in Queen Anne, and if I was about to disappear for a while, my mortal employer should probably know. Unfortunately, going into work meant facing some unpleasant things that I wasn\u0027t really in the mood for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina! What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie Sato, the Brutus to my Caesar, came scurrying up to me as I entered Emerald City Books and Caf¨¦. In Maddie\u0027s defense, she hadn\u0027t known Seth and I were dating when they\u0027d slept together. So, it wasn\u0027t like she\u0027d knowingly stolen him from me. That didn\u0027t really change my feelings toward either of them, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see Warren,\" I said, suspecting I probably reeked of vodka and smoke. \"Is he here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, making her glossy black hair sway. It was worn in a long, sleek style I\u0027d taught her how to do. \"He left about an hour ago. Didn\u0027t want to stick around for closing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at a clock. I\u0027d barely made it in before they locked the doors. I tapped my foot impatiently, wondering if I should call Warren at home. Finally, I asked, \"You got a sec to go over some schedule stuff? I\u0027m going to be out for a few days...or maybe more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said, smiling and showing dimples. \"You want me to grab Doug too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth assistant managers closing in one night. It was a stroke of luck. I headed off to my office while she went to fetch her brother Doug. My desk was organized for a change, and I found the clipboard bearing the schedule for the next couple of weeks. I skimmed it, relieved to see we had a full complement of staff for a change. My immortal friends didn\u0027t understand why I cared so much about this job. There had been days recently-days when I didn\u0027t want to get out of bed because I was so depressed-that I\u0027d wondered the same thing. But the truth was, eternity was an extremely long time, and I\u0027d spent most of my time always occupied with some activity. It was part of my nature; I couldn\u0027t be idle. And sometimes- sometimes -I could get so caught up in the day-to-day affairs of the human world that I could almost pretend for a heartbeat that I was one of them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll need anyone to cover me,\" I said when I heard the office door open a few minutes later. \"Someone\u0027ll just need to take over my-\" I looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie had returned, along with Doug, but they weren\u0027t alone. Seth was with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the easy confidence I\u0027d shown in the store, all the brashness and bravado I\u0027d shown at the club...it all shriveled up into a cold, hard knot as I looked at him. Walls slammed down around me. How could he affect me like this, particularly while wearing a Buck Rogers T-shirt? It had been three months. Why wasn\u0027t I over him? Why did I still want to cry or break something whenever I saw him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, Kincaid,\" said Doug, partially distracting me from my angst. He glanced at my outfit and raised an eyebrow. \"We interrupting your social life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wore a knee-length black trench coat over a short red dress. My makeup was done to seductive perfection, whorish dark eyeliner and lipstick to match the dress. Shape-shifting in the car would have been a snap, but I didn\u0027t feel like I needed to prove anything here. In fact, I kind of reveled in my tramp look tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently this is my social life, if I\u0027m pathetic enough to come in on a Saturday night.\" I forced myself to focus on Doug and Maddie only, trying hard not to look at Seth\u0027s soft, coppery brown hair or gentle eyes. Why did he have to be here of all nights? The answer: he was here every night. He was an author and did his best work in coffee shops. When we\u0027d broken up, he\u0027d tried to tactfully find another and stay away from me, but Maddie-oblivious to his reasons-had begged him to stay at the bookstore\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" asked Maddie. \"Is everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah,\" I said brusquely. \"Long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beckoned Maddie and Doug to the clipboard, explaining again how I was pretty sure the store would be fine without my labor, so long as they could cover the tasks I did as manager. We sketched out a brief list of my responsibilities, like payroll and inventory, and began divvying them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug tapped the list. \"I\u0027ve done all these before, at one time or another. They\u0027re no problem. I\u0027ll take the first half.\" He elbowed his sister. \"What about you? You gonna take the rest and pull your share here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie pursed her lips. She was immensely talented but suffered from bouts of insecurity, which I\u0027d repeatedly told her was ridiculous. She\u0027d improved a lot over the months-again, thanks to me-but still faltered. \"I didn\u0027t realize you did so much. I hope I can learn it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop playing coy. I\u0027ll teach you,\" said Doug. \"You\u0027ll be as good as Kincaid in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said dryly. \"We\u0027re practically interchangeable anyway.\" Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Seth shift uncomfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole thing seems kind of sketchy, though,\" remarked Doug, tilting his head so that his black hair fell away from his face. \"You\u0027re going to be gone, but you\u0027re not sure when or how long? I thought you were the reliable one around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s...family stuff,\" I told them. \"Just gotta be dealt with. Besides, now you can have a chance to be responsible. You should be thanking me, Doug.\" He stuck his tongue out at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Warren going to be okay with it?\" asked Maddie, still fretting on my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me deal with Warren,\" I assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug scoffed at that, but Maddie didn\u0027t catch on. Warren, the store\u0027s marginally moral owner, had been a longtime sex buddy of mine. He gave me about as much energy as Dante, but he was convenient and suited my mood lately. I\u0027d stopped our tryst while dating Seth but had since returned to old habits. Doug had known about my affair with Warren then and now but was tactful enough to leave me to my own choices, aside from the occasional bit of eye rolling. I suspected Seth knew what was going on too, but I didn\u0027t care. Warren wasn\u0027t going to give me any grief about taking time off. I was too good at what I did, both at work and in the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shuffled one shift where I was supposed to have closed, and then I tossed the clipboard back on its pile, suddenly needing to get out of there as soon as possible. \"Alright. Thanks, team. I\u0027ll leave you to your work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off to hit the town?\" asked Doug, still amused. \"I can join you in about a half-hour. I know a killer party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Already hit the town. I\u0027m heading home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loser,\" he called after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie wished me well with my mysterious time off, and then I left them, walking through the store and exchanging greetings with my other co-workers as they scurried around with their closing tasks. I\u0027d nearly made it to the door when I heard someone call my name. I turned and saw Casey hurrying toward me. She was twenty or so and went to the University of Washington. She\u0027d worked here almost the entire time she\u0027d been in college and was one of our best employees. So, I stopped and forced a smile, my eyes straying longingly toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned, dark eyes sparkling. \"I wanted to know if you were going to go to my party next weekend,\" she said. \"You never answered the e-mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t remember any e-mail, but then, I\u0027d been pretty trigger-happy with the delete key lately. \"I didn\u0027t get it,\" I lied. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my graduation party. This Sunday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"It\u0027s April.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m graduating early. I got all my credits finished up, so I don\u0027t have to do spring quarter. Pretty cool, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa,\" I said, actually impressed. \"That is cool. Math, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Math and Latvian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why on earth-never mind.\" Now was not the time to pursue why someone of Filipino heritage was studying Baltic languages. \"I wish I could go, but I\u0027m leaving town tomorrow for some family stuff and don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll be back. I\u0027m really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey\u0027s face fell a little, but she told me she understood. And like Maddie, she wished me well and hoped my \"family\" business would be taken care of easily. That made two of us. She left me and went to finish her closing tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I cleared the store\u0027s door and was outdoors, I stopped and exhaled. Breezy night air washed over me. Being in Seth\u0027s presence was smothering. It stirred up too much in me. Even while talking business and numbers with Doug and Maddie, most of my attention had been on Seth-exactly how far away he stood from me, the way he smelled, the way his messy hair stuck up today. Everything else had been background noise compared to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching into my purse with shaking hands, I pulled out my cigarettes, desperately needing one for the walk home. I\u0027d smoked for a century or so and stopped ten years ago, something I\u0027d been very proud of, even though I was immune to the effects. Stress had driven me to pick up the habit again. I felt a little bad about subjecting others to secondhand smoke, but honestly, smoking was the least of my problems right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck.\" I flicked the switch on my lighter and got nothing. Three more flicks produced similar results. Holding the lighter up to my ear, I shook it. Nothing. It was out of fluid. \"Fuck,\" I repeated. I only lived a few blocks away, but somehow, that walk was now going to be agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I heard what sounded like a boot scuff around the corner of the building. Frowning, I took a few steps forward, wondering if anyone was there. This area was pretty safe, but Lower Queen Anne still had its share of vagrants. Yet, when I glanced around the corner, there was no one there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was, however, a pack of matches lying on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKneeling down, I picked the book up and examined them. Mark\u0027s Mad Martini Bar. I\u0027d been there a long time ago. It was in Upper Queen Anne, not too far away if you didn\u0027t mind trekking up the hill. It wasn\u0027t unreasonable that a pack of their matches would find their way here. What was weird was that the matches showed up right when I needed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me, I heard the store\u0027s door open. \"Georgina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose and turned sharply around. Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, hoping for blandness. The smothering feeling returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight from inside the store lit up his features in the twilight, and I ate up every line and angle of his face. His eyes looked dark in the dimness, but in full light, they were brown infused with amber. He stuffed his hands into his pockets, and his gaze wouldn\u0027t meet mine. It was painfully reminiscent of how he\u0027d been when we first met, too shy to look directly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to see if you were okay,\" he said after several awkward moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned the matches over in my hand a couple of times and then placed them in my purse\u0027s outer pocket. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I said, keeping my voice cool and distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just...\" He relaxed slightly and gave a small, rueful laugh. \"When you\u0027re vague about your activities and mention \u0027family,\u0027 it usually means immortal business. And immortal business always means trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to smile, then immediately squelched it. \"Yeah, it does, and believe me, it\u0027s a great one this time.\" Even after everything that had gone down between us, there was such a comfort and familiarity with him that I immediately wanted to launch in and recap the story for him. I could already see us both laughing at the idea of Canadian Satanists. I could perfectly picture the way Seth would shake his head in exasperation. But it wasn\u0027t to be. I was too hurt and too proud to even allow him friendship, so I just shrugged and said, \"But it\u0027ll work out. It always does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...but usually not without a lot of hassle. I\u0027m just worried about you, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be.\" Not anymore . \"I\u0027m not in any danger. Mostly just annoyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to speak, and I knew the gesture. He wanted to argue that there was still cause for concern-but times had changed. He swallowed and let the comment go. More silence fell. I knew I should leave, but somehow, I couldn\u0027t make myself do it. He apparently couldn\u0027t either. \"You...you look really great tonight,\" he said at last, still fumbling for conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a catch in his voice. He knew my looks tonight had to do with more than just my body and outfit. The energy I\u0027d stolen from sleeping with the therapist wreathed me. Life and its power were irresistible to all creatures, mortal and immortal alike. Immortals could literally see that life glowing around me. To mortals, I simply looked beautiful. Unearthly. Perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the sake of politeness, I pretended he was complimenting me for normal things. \"Thanks. I was out with the others when all this...stuff...went down. It\u0027s kind of put a damper on my partying, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded by way of answer and shifted so that he actually made eye contact. I wished he hadn\u0027t. My heart melted inside me, and I felt a sob building in my chest. Desperate for something to do, I took out the serendipitous matches and lit the cigarette I\u0027d been holding the whole time. I took a long drag and exhaled. Seth stepped back. He wasn\u0027t a fan of smoking. It was like I suddenly had armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said, feeling bolder, \"I should go home and pack. See you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and had only taken a step when he called out to me. \"Georgina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you...um...\" He faltered, and again, I was reminded of that long-ago Seth. Bittersweet feelings burned within me. \"Do you need someone to feed your cat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. \"No, but thanks. Cody\u0027ll do it.\" I spoke the next words, fully knowing they\u0027d inflict damage. \"Or Dante will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth flinched, and somehow, I felt both triumphant and sad at the same time. \"No problem,\" he said haltingly. \"Just thought I\u0027d, you know, check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said again. We held each other\u0027s gazes a few more moments, and then I turned away and walked off into the night. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-2.html","bookId":2057,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM"}
