It was dated at the Sherman House, Chicago, and ran thus:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I am called away suddenly on business, and may be absent for a month.

I don\u0027t stand much chance myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must see if I can\u0027t find some temporary work for you to do. Suppose we take an ice cream. Do you know any good place near by?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 168]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is one on Sixth Avenue.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, we will go there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scott led the way to the place already referred to, frequented by his cousin, Loammi. When they entered, Scott saw Loammi seated at a table in the rear part of the saloon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He espied the new arrival, and was evidently surprised to meet Scott in such a place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hello, Scott!\" he called out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-evening, Loammi,\" returned Scott, coolly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Goin\u0027 to take an ice cream?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say, are you working yet?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not yet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then how can you afford to buy ice cream?\" Loammi was about to ask, but the presence of Justin Wood checked him. Mr. Wood was handsomely dressed, and looked like a man of means.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder where Scott picked him up,\" thought Loammi. He wished to be introduced, but Scott did not give any encouragement in that direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi, having no good excuse to stay, rose and left the saloon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So that\u0027s your cousin?\" remarked Justin Wood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 169]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He looks sly. I am something of a judge of faces, and I don\u0027t like his.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose I am prejudiced against him,\" said Scott. \"I don\u0027t think I could ever like him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scarcely had Loammi left the saloon, when Scott was surprised to see Ezra Little and his wife enter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Little first caught sight of Scott, and spoke in a low tone to her husband.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra Little, turning his glance in the direction of Scott, eyed him severely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So this is where you spend your ill-gotten money,\" he said, not noticing that Scott was in the company of the fashionably dressed young man sitting on the opposite side of the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said Justin Wood, \"but it is my money that is being spent.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was not aware that you were in the boy\u0027s company,\" said Ezra Little, respectfully, for he saw that Mr. Wood was a gentleman of social position. \"I must explain that your companion left my house a week since under discreditable circumstances.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He told me the circumstances. You assumed that the money he had in his possession was stolen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There can hardly be a doubt of it. There was[Pg 170] a five-dollar billâ€”and the missing pocketbook contained a five-dollar bill.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am personally cognizant of the fact that the money was his own. Indeed, I helped to recover it for him from a swindler who had robbed him of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This does not explain the pocketbook being found in his chamber.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where your son put it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is a strange charge to make, sir. Have you any grounds for making it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Scott and I called at your house this evening. The servant said that an hour before the discovery of the pocketbook your son was seen by her coming out of Scott\u0027s room.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra Little looked startled, and Mrs. Little looked distressed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Moreover, I think if you inquire, you will find that some of the stolen money was disposed of in this saloon. Your son only went out ten minutes since. Suppose you inquire whether he has changed a five-dollar bill here recently.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will do so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra Little went up to the cashier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I understand,\" he said, \"that my son comes in here frequently.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 171]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir, he was here this evening.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you call to mind whether you have ever changed a five-dollar bill for him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I did so about a week since. Was there anything wrong about the bill?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I only asked out of curiosity.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra was a hard man, but he was not altogether unjust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Scott,\" he said, \"I think there may have been some mistake about your taking the pocketbook. If you will call at the store to-morrow, I will see about taking you back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scott bowed, but did not speak. He felt that he could never again be contented in Mr. Little\u0027s employment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they left the saloon he asked: \"What do you advise me to do about going back, Mr. Wood?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t go,\" said Justin Wood, promptly. \"I will stand by you, and see if I can\u0027t get you something better.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir.

He had no suspicion of trouble, but was eager to tell his father that he had seen Scott.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not observe the unusual sternness on Mr. Little\u0027s face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pa,\" he said, \"I saw Scott to-night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where did you see him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At an ice-cream saloon on Sixth Avenue. His money seems to have lasted him pretty well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What were you doing there?\" was his father\u0027s unexpected question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Getting an ice cream,\" answered Loammi, in surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So your money seems to have lasted pretty well also,\" said his father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"An ice cream costs only ten cents, pa.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How many times have you been there within a week?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Once or twice, I believe,\" answered Loammi, wondering what his father meant by his strict cross-examination.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you sure you have not been there every evening?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you ever had a bill changed there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 173]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know what you mean, pa.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Loammi began to fear that he did understand, and he turned pale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where,\" asked his father, sternly, \"did you get the five-dollar bill that you got changed there a week ago to-day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know anything about any five-dollar bill.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi looked frightened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wasn\u0027t it the money you found in your mother\u0027s pocketbook?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But Scott took that, pa. You know the pocketbook was found in his room.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, by you. You knew just where to look for it, for you concealed it there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, pa, who told you any such wicked story about me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go downstairs and ask Ellen to come up here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi would willingly have been excused from doing this, but he knew there was no alternative.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Ellen appeared, Mr. Little said: \"Do you remember the evening when the pocketbook was found in Master Scott\u0027s room?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Had Scott been in his room that evening?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 174]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think not, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Had any one else been in the room?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw Loammi coming out from the room about half-past eight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, what a story!\" ejaculated Loammi, in perturbation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is true, sir,\" said Ellen, firmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no doubt of it.
