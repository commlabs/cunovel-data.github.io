About two hills over.\" Jenni slid her fingers through her hair and sat up a little. \"Maybe those things aren\u0027t out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni laughed a little, her voice sounding odd to her ears. \"You know, this isn\u0027t supposed to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie glanced over at her and nodded just a little. \"I know, but it is happening, whatever this is.\" Then she added quickly, \"Zombies, or whatever they are, just shouldn\u0027t exist. Maybe it\u0027s some sort of terrorist weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t supposed to be so fast. They\u0027re supposed to be slow. Very slow.\" Jenni sighed and pouted a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning down the stairs, trying to evade Lloyd, that had been terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no time to think, just run. It was sheer luck that he didn\u0027t seem to know how to open the door and had just banged against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Movies. Lloyd always watched those movies. I was afraid but he made me watch.\" Jenni chewed on her bottom lip. \"If the movie is right, we can\u0027t let them bite us.\" She looked over at Katie warily. \"You\u0027re not bitten, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie looked at her for a long, frightening moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni sighed, relieved. \"No. I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she almost had been. Lloyd had almost grabbed hold of her when Mikey had turned back and yelled, \"Leave Mom alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covered her face with one hand. She tried hard not remember the horrible fear she had felt \"Run, Mikey,\" she had screamed and run out the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow it slammed behind her, she didn\u0027t know. Maybe she closed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Mikey did. Maybe when Lloyd had grabbed her son he had shoved it shut. But the front door had slammed and she had been alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie briefly glanced over at her and sighed. \"I got lost in your neighborhood trying to get off the highway. I heard you screaming. I pulled up behind you just as-You didn\u0027t seem to notice me so I yelled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat easy. That simple. Why hadn\u0027t she heard the truck pull up behind her on the lawn? Well, she had been screaming and MikeyJenni leaned toward the window and studied her reflection in the tiny side mirror. Her eyes looked too big, too wide. Her face was very pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m in shock,\" she said to Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we all,\" Katie responded in a somewhat harsh voice. Thinking better of her comment, she said in a much softer tone, \"Yeah, I think you are, too. It was hard to see my wife like that. But your husband, your children…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and gripped Jenni\u0027s hand tightly. \"I can\u0027t imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni clung to her hand desperately, grateful for the kindness. She really didn\u0027t care about Lloyd being dead…undead…whatever. The children. That was harder. Much harder. She didn\u0027t want to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to ask Katie about her wife, the beautiful woman in the photo on the phone, but she was afraid to ask. Afraid that Katie might think she was being judgmental and withdraw her comforting hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Katie jerked her hand away from Jenni and yanked the steering wheel hard to the left. Slamming on the brakes, they both were jerked forward and caught firmly, painfully by their seat belts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car was idling on the right hand side of the road. A man stood near it, covered in blood, looking at their truck in a daze. It was as if something snapped inside of him and he flung out his hands and rushed toward the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie quickly reversed off the shoulder of the road, then shifted gears and the truck leaped forward. The man\u0027s hand slapped hard against the side of the truck and they could hear his nails scrapping the metal as they escaped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni whirled around in her seat and looked out the back window. The man was running hard, pumping his arms, screeching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How fast are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty,\" Katie responded. \"He\u0027s keeping up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the man howled and his legs seemed to pop out of alignment and he tumbled hard to the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slammed on the brakes and looked back. \"He blew his joints!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man staggered to his feet, looked around, saw the truck and began to slowly hobble toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that is the way they are supposed to be!\" Jenni grinned at Katie triumphantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He blew out his knees!\" Katie laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both screamed as a mouth filled with sharp teeth suddenly appeared in the back window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Katie blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA German Shepherd stared at them looking a little dazed. He was smiling at them, but looked worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie flung open the door and looked into the bed of the truck. A veterinarian\u0027s temporary cardboard carrier was chewed open and the young German Shepherd stood on wobbly legs before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni leaned out of the driver\u0027s side. \"Uh, zombie-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie looked up to see the man still shambling toward them. He was a distance away, but would soon be a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni picked up the shotgun from the floor of the truck and handed it to Katie. \"Just shoot him in the head. That\u0027s how it works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie blinked at her, then looked back at the man. \"I can\u0027t.\" She handed the gun back and reached out to the dog. \"Come here, puppy, come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog padded slowly over to her and she lifted his heavy body out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding him tightly, she slid him into the cab. As a second thought, she snagged the vet paperwork taped to the carrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni, meanwhile, solemnly got out of the cab, released the safety, pumped the shotgun and waited. The zombified man was almost to the truck, moaning, reaching out to her. For a moment, he looked remarkably like Lloyd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headless corpse hit the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell did you just do?\" Katie looked utterly shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked at her plaintively. \"We have to kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie opened her mouth, then shut it. She looked shocked at Jenni\u0027s actions, but was more concerned at the moment with the groggy, half-grown German Shepherd. She climbed into the cab and shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni sighed and climbed in as well, slipping the safety back on the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ran over the runners back in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I panicked. I…\" Katie faltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni sighed sadly. She needed Katie to be strong. She needed her to be the strong one. She hadn\u0027t minded shooting the zombie as an example and she would kill them in the future, but Katie needed to lead. Jenni couldn\u0027t bear the thought of having to figure all of this out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie stroked the dog\u0027s fur as she looked at Jenni for a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll talk about this later. We need gas now. And Jack here, well, we need to keep him up here. Poor baby just had surgery. Good thing he was knocked out during most of our escape.\" She nuzzled the dog and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack?\" Jenni smiled. \"I like that name.\" She wrapped her arms around the dog and pulled him onto her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what his vet papers say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie smiled slightly and nodded to herself. \"Okay, gas station next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGas, food, supplies, and we keep going until we figure out where the hell we are going? Sound good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jenni answered. Snuggling the dog tight, she sighed with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was back in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. In The Shadow of the Dying World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie sighed with relief when she saw the gas station sign up ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe needle on the gas gauge was dipping dangerously under empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the lack of any \"zombies\" out on the road, she did not want to get stuck walking anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her Jenni was busy lavishing attention on the German Shepherd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was having a tough time understanding Jenni. The first time she had seen her, Jenni had seemed to be in a daze. The first spark of life she had shown was when she had blown the zombie\u0027s head off. Now she seemed more alive. Yes, that was it. A little more animated. It almost seemed weirder than her trance-like state when Katie had first saved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who was she to judge? What was normal when the world was dissolving around you and reality suddenly looked like a Dali painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling into the gas station slowly, Katie leaned forward over the steering wheel to stare across the expanse of the parking lot. There were no cars parked in the lot or tucked under the metal canopy over the gas pumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked utterly deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re lucky, the pumps are still on. I\u0027ll use my credit card, \"she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked up, rubbing her lips against the dog\u0027s ear. \"You should fill up the gas can, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. And if we can get into the store, we should load up on food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slowly released the brake and let the truck glide up to a pump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more looking all around her, she turned off the truck. Reaching down, she picked up the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here is the plan. I\u0027m going to pump the gas. You are going to keep a watch out and hold the shotgun. Obviously, you can use it. You see any of those things, you tell me immediately.\" Katie handed Jenni the shotgun, studying her intently. Now that Jenni wasn\u0027t looking like a zombie herself, Katie could see she was quite pretty with deep, alert eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-4.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
