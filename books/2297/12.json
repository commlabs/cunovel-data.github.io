She had been mildly amused, and then angry, when he declined. She had let him feel her power then - let him know his refusal was as useless as a candle in a dark wind - and then she had withdrawn, leaving him breathless and sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were so willing the last time,\" she had murmured. \"So strong for one so young - so virile! So like my Grigori of old. I could take you now, willing or not, but it is so much more pleasant when you are willing. And you will be willing...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the ceiling, her words purring through his memory, and shivered. Would he? The memory of the night when they had hunted and then slept together was both repugnant and thrilling. Sitting up, he pushed the vivid images aside to consider what she had said about driving the other vampires from the city. It had been a subtle warning, but a warning just the same. She had killed young Dracul, he had no doubt of that. He grunted softly. On one level, he was pleased that there was one less vampire to haunt the world. He knew she would have killed LaSalle without a qualm, couldn\u0027t help wondering if she had already warned Madame Rosa and Noah Fox to get out of Dodge, and if they would go without a fight. He had felt her power, up close and personal. Unless the others were very strong, any fight with Khira would have only one conclusion. With Chiavari, the outcome would be less certain. Of them all, Chiavari was the only one who might possess the power necessary to thwart her. Of the two, Chiavari was clearly the lesser of two evils. Chiavari was disciplined. Even within the constraints of his hunger, he was almost merciful. He did not kill indiscriminately, as did Khira. Would Chiavari go at Khira\u0027s whim? Leave the city unprotected?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey swung his legs over the edge of the bed, ran a hand through his hair. What the hell would he do if she told him to leave? He had no ties in the city, no reason to stay, and while he didn\u0027t mind leaving if it was his idea, he didn\u0027t like the idea of tucking his tail between his legs and skulking away like a whipped cur. Nor could he live with the idea of leaving the unsuspecting community without some measure of protection from Khira. His blood might be mingled now with that of the undead, but in his heart and soul he was still a Ramsey, sworn to protect the innocent from the ravages of the undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of her power sliding over his skin cooled his rising anger. He would worry about Khira later. She had not yet called for a showdown, and now, with the Hunger clawing at his belly, she was, for the moment, the least of his worries. Need burned through him, the pain like shards of glass flowing through his veins, overshadowing every other thought, every other desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, he showered and dressed, then left the house. He eased his hellish thirst on the first person he found. His mind grasped hers. His arms imprisoned her, and he took what he wanted, what he needed, as though it were his right. He accomplished his task quickly, taking no pleasure in it. Releasing the woman, he vanished from her sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet satisfied, he walked on, searching for another victim. Without conscious thought, he found himself standing on the street across from Kelly Anderson\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, he wondered, why was he drawn to this woman? It was more than a hunger for her blood. He could satisfy his demon thirst anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there for a full five minutes, staring up at the window of her apartment, not questioning how he knew which one was hers. He murmured her name, and a moment later, she opened the window and looked down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe command rose in his mind effortlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, she was there, walking toward him, her hair falling over her shoulders like waves of black silk. She was beautiful, he thought, and for once it wasn\u0027t the desire for blood that filled his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClasping her hand in his, he took her home. He locked the front door, turned on a lamp. And all the while, she stood in the middle of the room, unmoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, her expression blank, like a robot\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment, then freed his hold on her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" She glanced at her surroundings, her eyes wild. \"How did I get here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed up, one hand going to her throat. \"Leave me alone. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. Why did you bring me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just...\" He clenched his hands, wishing he had more experience with women. \"I just want to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you.\" She stared at him, her eyes wide with fear. \"I saw you... lying in the basement. I thought you were dead. You were burned, your face, your hands and arms... and now...\" Her gaze moved over him. \"It\u0027s like nothing ever happened. There\u0027s not even a scar! Who are you? What are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I am, Kelly. Say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She took another step away from him. \"It\u0027s not possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The proof stands before you. Refusing to say it will not make it any less true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no such thing.\" She shook her head in denial. \"It\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say it.\" His voice was soft, gentle, yet demanded an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampire,\" she whispered hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kept me here against my will. You... you drank from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" And he wanted to drink from her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the rapid beat of her heart, intensified by the fear building within her. Her gaze darted around the room, lingered on the door, came back to his face. He knew the moment she made her decision, was waiting for her when she reached the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed, a wordless cry of terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly.\" He took hold of her hands in an effort to calm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked him in the shins, drove her knee into his groin with all the strength at her command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doubled over in pain, his breath hissing between his clenched teeth. But he did not release his grip on her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the pain subsided and he could breathe again, he straightened. \"Damn it, I\u0027m not going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you promise to listen to me if I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she replied quickly. Too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t elude me, Kelly. You can\u0027t outrun me. So you might as well sit down and listen to what I have to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently realizing the truth of what he said, she went back into the living room and sat down on the edge of the sofa, her hands clenched so tight the knuckles were white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening,\" she said, her voice sullen, like that of an angry child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry if I frightened you. If I hurt you. I have only been a vampire a short time and I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I am not sure yet what I am doing, or how to do it,\" he finished, determined to say it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. \"So, you\u0027re like a fledging vampire, is that it? And you thought you\u0027d practice on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I want something from you.\" He held up his hand. \"Not your blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen where you live. I know you haven\u0027t any money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefiance flashed through her eyes. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to kill me.\" The words seemed to flow of their own volition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pay you well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounded to her feet. \"You\u0027re even crazier than I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t argue but sat down on the sofa once more, her body poised for flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go on like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like being a vampire?\" She spoke slowly, quietly, as though trying to humor a lunatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, then dropped down onto the chair across from her. \"I didn\u0027t want this life. It was thrust upon me.\" He closed his eyes as the horror of that night washed across his memory. And then he poured his memories into the girl\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristov had pushed him against a wall, held him there while he buried his fangs in Ramsey\u0027s throat. It had been Chiavari who had pulled Kristov off him, Chiavari who drove a stake through the other vampire\u0027s heart. Ramsey remembered no more after that until he woke in Chiavari\u0027s arms, the vampire urging him to drink from the cut in his wrist. Chiavari\u0027s voice had been soft yet compelling, as soothing as a mother\u0027s lullaby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrink, Ramsey, he had urged. Drink your fill . And Ramsey had done just that, suffusing his depleted body with the accursed vampire blood until Chiavari jerked his arm away. He remembered the confusion that followed, the horror he had felt when Marisa told him what had happened. It had been Marisa\u0027s idea to bring him over, but it was Chiavari he blamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could still hear Marisa\u0027s sweet voice asking if he would rather be dead, and his own sharp reply: Of course I would ! Now, as then, he wondered how he could feel the same and be so different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned by what had happened that night, he had thanked Chiavari for saving his life, and then left the house. Thanked him! His lips twisted. Thanked him for making him a monster...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low groan brought him back to the present. Suddenly aware of the effect his thoughts were having on the girl, he cut the connection between his mind and hers. She was lying back on the sofa, her eyes closed, her face drained of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly, are you all right?\" he asked. \"Kelly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyelashes fluttered, and then her eyes opened. She sat up slowly, looking at him as if she had never seen him before. \"You really are a vampire, aren\u0027t you? It\u0027s not a game you play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Will you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. Not like that. Not... not kill you. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, why not? I\u0027ll make it worth your while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can it be murder,\" he asked bitterly, \"when I am already dead? Hell, there won\u0027t even be a body if you drag me out into the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face grew even more pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he muttered. He was ashamed of his weakness, ashamed of asking her to do what he himself had failed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it so awful?\" she asked. \"Being a... a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was born to hunt them. It\u0027s what my family has done for generations. It was my sole purpose in life, my reason for living. And now...\" He laughed bitterly. \"Now I am what I have always hated, what I have spent my life hunting. And you ask if it\u0027s awful?\" He laughed again - a cold bitter sound, like leaves fluttering over a grave. \"You wanted to die when I found you. Now I want to die. Perhaps we could meet death together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No. I was wrong to even think of it. And so are you. Suicide is a sin. My granny taught me that life was precious, and not to be wasted. I... I never thanked you for saving my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, she crossed the short distance between them, hesitated a moment, then bent down and kissed his cheek. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, his gaze meeting hers. \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled down at him, and in that moment he knew he wanted to live long enough to kiss her, just once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey took a deep breath, afraid he was about to make a fool of himself. Again. He cleared his throat, wishing he had been blessed with Chiavari\u0027s innate charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly, I want to ask you something...\" When she started to speak, he held up his hand to silence her. \"Please, hear me out. I know you\u0027ve had a hard time lately, that you\u0027ve been unhappy, and that you think you have nothing to live for...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know all that?\" she demanded. \"Did you read my diary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him, then sat down hard. \"You did what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read your mind when I took your blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s terrible! How could you do such a despicable thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a sudden urge to laugh. \"Please, just listen. I am about to make you a proposition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you, I\u0027m not into murder. And I\u0027m not into whoring, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, woman, just listen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face at him, then folded her hands in her lap. \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to move in here with me. Purely platonic,\" he added quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need a better place to live, and I... I could use someone to keep an eye on things during the day. I\u0027ll make it worth your while. It will only be for a few months. Six at the most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Thanks, but I don\u0027t think so.\" She looked at him warily. \"Can I go now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you would stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe regarded him steadily for several moments. \"You don\u0027t want a housekeeper; you want a companion, don\u0027t you? Someone to keep you company in this mausoleum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I know I could trust you to behave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have my word as a gentleman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed out loud. \"What about your word as a vampire? Do I have your word that you won\u0027t...\" She grimaced with revulsion. \"That you won\u0027t drink my blood again? And that you\u0027ll stay out of my thoughts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must be out of my mind,\" she muttered. \"Totally, completely bonkers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward. \"Then you\u0027ll stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a week,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll try it for a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A month,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about it for a moment, then nodded. \"All right. One month.\" She tilted her head to one side. \"Do you sleep in a coffin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that was mandatory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I think it\u0027s something only Hollywood and old-world vampires are into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you sleep, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a room off the cellar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied him for a long moment, her eyes narrowed. It was tempting to read her thoughts, but he refrained from doing so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said at last. \"I\u0027ll move in tomorrow, if that\u0027s okay with you. Could you call me a cab?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? It would probably get stolen before the engine cooled off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted softly. He had never been particularly concerned about material possessions, probably because he\u0027d never owned much more than a beat-up Chevy and the clothes on his back, but he was fond of the Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called for a cab, walked her to the door when it arrived, then stood there, watching her drive away, wondering if she would come back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-sundown-vampire-trilogy-2/page-12.html","bookId":2297,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
