{"id":94972,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eRussell Baker was a boxer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA damn good one, too, apparently. He was twenty-five, fought in the coveted welterweight division, had a record of 22-3, and was moving quickly up the rankings. There were whispers that he might fight Manny Pacquiao - or Floyd Mayweather, Jr. His management was presently negotiating a fight on HBO. He\u0027d already fought around the world: Tokyo, Dubai, South Africa. He\u0027d already beaten some of the top contenders in the world. Only the best remained. Only the champions remained. Russell Baker was on top of the boxing world and nothing could slow him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was, until his last fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had killed a man in the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell paused in his narrative, and I waited. He was a good-looking guy, clearly roped with muscle under his thin tee-shirt. His nose was wide and flat, which I suspected was perfect for boxing. A long, pointed nose probably got broken routinely. He was also small, perhaps just a few inches taller than me. Welterweights must be the little guys. If I had to guess, I would have said that he was exactly half the size of Kingsley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter collecting himself, Russell continued. The fight had been last month, in Vegas. Russell had been working his way through the top ten fighters in his weight class. According to Russell, rankings were influenced by a boxer\u0027s win-loss record, the difficulty of one\u0027s opponents, and how convincing one\u0027s victories were. The ultimate goal was to challenge for a title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast month, he\u0027d fought the #7 ranked contender. Russell himself had currently been ranked #8. The fight was aired live on ESPN. The crowd had been full of celebrities. Up through three rounds, it had been a routine-enough fight, with Russell feeling confident and strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is, until the fourth round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a short, straight punch to the side of the face. A hard punch. One that, if landed squarely, would rock most opponents. And Russell had landed it squarely. His opponent\u0027s head snapped back nicely. Russell had moved in closer to land another punch, but his opponent, Caesar Marquez, was already on his way to the mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell had been confused. The punch had been solid, sure, but not a knockout punch. But there was Caesar Marquez, out cold, motionless. Russell had celebrated, but not for long, not when Caesar remained motionless and a crowd began swarming around his fallen opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell stopped talking and looked away, tears in his eyes. He unconsciously rubbed his knuckles, which were, I noticed, puffy and scarred. An IM message box appeared on the computer screen before me. It was Fang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou there, Moon Dance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward and tapped a few keys: I am, but working. Talk soon, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler did it, Moon Dance. Always the butler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and closed the box. Admittedly, I was mildly surprised that the box appeared. Fang always seemed to know when I was working - and respected my time with my clients. I frowned at that as I turned my attention back to Russell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask how your opponent died?\" I asked, lowering my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good question, Ms. Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please call me Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Officially, they called it brain damage. Unofficially, they found nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The M.E. told me. He personally called me up and told me that he couldn\u0027t find anything other than some bleeding - enough to officially label it a brain hemorrhage, but not enough to cause death. At least, not in the opinion of the medical examiner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, why are you here, Russ?\" I asked, trying out a nickname to get him to spill more details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued rubbing his knuckles. His foot, which was crossed over his knee, was jiggling and shaking. Now he rubbed the back of his neck. The bicep that bulged as he did so was...interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Sam. I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do,\" I said. \"Why are you here, Russell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t think I killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you didn\u0027t kill him, then who - or what - did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Sam. I guess that\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I want you to help me find out how he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back and folded my hands over my flattish stomach. Flat enough for me, anyway. I sensed so many emotions coming from Russ that it was hard to get a handle on them. Sensing emotion and reading minds are two different things. I wasn\u0027t close enough to Russ to read his mind, but his emotions were fair game to anyone sensitive enough to understand them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly, I sensed guilt coming off him. Wave after wave of it. I sensed that Russell hadn\u0027t been able to move forward from this fight and had been unable to deal with what had happened last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed answers. Real answers. Not the suspicious whisperings of a medical examiner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if I discover that you really did kill him, Russell?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I can live with that, but I need to know,\" he said, wiping his eyes and looking away. \"I need to know for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing is good,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing is everything,\" he said, and I didn\u0027t doubt it for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I\u0027ll need names and contact info.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said he would email me everything I needed. We next discussed my retainer fee and, once done, he handed over his credit card. I spent the next few minutes embarrassing myself until I finally figured out how to use my iPhone credit card swiper. If I could have turned red, I would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe next shook hands, and if he noticed my cold flesh, he didn\u0027t show it. Or was too polite to show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he left my office, I couldn\u0027t help but notice the dark cloud that surrounded him. His aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt, I knew, was eating him alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-2.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
