{"id":23377,"no":28,"title":"Chapter XXVII","content":"\u0026nbsp;WHEN the new officials of Rush County took their offices there was a great deal of anxiety among the law violators in Wilford Springs and not without reason. C.M. Stanton, the county attorney, and Dan Brown, the sheriff, were both Klansmen, who would now have the backing of fifteen hundred other Klansmen who would give them their loyal support in the enforcement of law. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The governor\u0027s investigations for the purpose of gathering evidence against the Klan had resulted in nothing of consequence except to inform the public as to the identity of a few Klansmen and to reveal a very few irregularities committed by some misguided Klansmen who had not understood the nature of their obligations as Klansmen. After spending a great deal of time and money in making these investigations the attorney-general and governor had not produced one iota of evidence to prove that the Klan committed acts of violence or took the law into its own hands. On the contrary, they found that the organization was doing much to assist the officers in the enforcement of law.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Governor Slydell\u0027s term of office came to a close and he again joined the ranks of private citizens the ouster suit was still pending in the Supreme Court where it continued to be carried over from term to term until finally dismissed. Meanwhile the Klan grew not only in Wilford Springs but throughout the state.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Two weeks after the new attorney and sheriff were sworn into office a raid was made on five houses where liquor was being sold. The raid was made by the sheriff\u0027s force, unbeknown to the mayor and chief of police. Much liquor was confiscated and destroyed, the proprietors arrested and the following morning given a speedy trial and a long jail sentence. When Hennesy found himself in jail he called for the county attorney and made affidavit that the mayor and chief of police patronized his place. Within two hours after this affidavit was made the mayor and chief were given a chance to resign or face ouster proceedings. They preferred to resign.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n About one o\u0027clock on this memorable day when Wilford Springs awoke to the realization of the fact that \u0027a clean-up\u0027 was on, Pat McBryan came to Stover\u0027s office.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess we\u0027re in for it,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s up now, Pat?\" Stover asked, \"nothing serious, is there? Nothing really to worry about.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hell\u0027s just broke loose, that\u0027s all. Of course, that\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I just heard that both Clark and Roberts have resigned.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the matter with them?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hennesy squealed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s bad,\" said Stover, rubbing his hands together.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bad? It\u0027s hell.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m going over to my office and write out my resignation as commissioner at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why so?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The chances are that there is going to be a lot of investigation going on around here. I am going to sell out and leave the country.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, don\u0027t get scared and go to telling anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m not telling, but I\u0027m going to go while the going is good.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n McBryan left the room. The sound of his footsteps had scarcely died away when the banker\u0027s office door opened and someone entered without knocking. The banker was surprised, and a cold chill ran down his spinal column, when he looked up and saw Dan Brown, the new sheriff, standing before him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do you do, Mr. Stover?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Our new sheriff, I believe,\" said Stover, great drops of perspiration coming out on his forehead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Stover, I\u0027ll have to trouble you to come with me. I have a warrant for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A warrant for me?\" Stover was now rubbing his hands together violently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the charge?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Forgery and obtaining money fraudulently.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who is the complaining witness?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You come on and when we get to the court house you can go into the office of the clerk of the district court and read the entire charge.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n About an hour later, after Stover had been released on bond, he called Harold King over the \u0027phone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is this King?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, this is King.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you would come down to my office. I want to see you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you want to see me it will be necessary to come to my office.\" Stover hung up the receiver and muttered, \"The insolent puppy.\" However, he grabbed his hat and started for King\u0027s office without a moment\u0027s delay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he reached the architect\u0027s office he announced himself by demanding in a loud voice, which was unusual for him, \"You young upstart, what do you mean by making that absurd complaint against me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have a chair, Mr. Stover.\" Stover stared at him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have a chair, I say,\" Harold indicated one with a gesture. Stover sat down. The sangfroid of this young fellow discomfited him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want to know what you mean?\" Stover asked when he had recovered himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mean about what?\" Harold asked coolly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By those ridiculous charges you made against me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you read the complaint?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I have.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you know all about it. I don\u0027t need to tell you anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s preposterous. Young man, you\u0027re making a fool of yourself. You can\u0027t prove anything, and in the end you will be laughed at.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stover, I can prove all I have charged. At any rate the jury will decide.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What proof have you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It will be time enough to present the proof when you come to trial.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"King, what do you and your friends want?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is simply a case of blackmail. How much do you and your friends want?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold sprang from his chair and stood in front of Stover, a fire of anger flamed from his eyes, and he opened and shut his hands forcibly. Harold King, the Klansman, fought hard with himself. He could scarce restrain his hands from clutching Stover\u0027s skinny throat. When he had mastered himself he walked back to his chair and sat down. \"Stover,\" he said, \"don\u0027t repeat that unless you want them to try me for homicide in the district court, and unless you want an immediate trial by the Supreme Judge of the Universe.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stover, now trembling and white, changed his attitude. \"Mr. King,\" he said, rubbing his hands and swallowing hard, \"it may be that the girl does not understand the deal I had with her father. Babcock owed me twenty thousand dollars and I bought his interest in the Zala bank for that amount. I explained this to Ruth, but it is quite likely that someone has been misrepresenting the transaction to her. The girl has had a hard time. I feel sorry for her, and while I do not owe her a cent I will make her a present of five thousand dollars to help her out if you will have this case dismissed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nothing doing. Stover, you are an unmitigated liar and crook. You robbed Babcock and Watson; you tried to bribe me to betray the Klan. Like the cowardly cur that you are you tried to fight me through your dirty attack on a young woman. You talk of being sorry. You haven\u0027t the capacity within your craven soul to be sorry for anybody but yourself. You see that door. Get out of it at once or I may not be able to keep my hands off you.\" Harold stood with his finger pointing to the door while Stover left without looking back.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89895.html","bookId":491,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM"}
