Frankly she didn’t see the resemblance. Her daughter was nothing like her in temperament or in looks. At almost twenty, Chrissie still had a lot of growing up to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s in the eyes,” her mother continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah looked again, partly, she supposed, in the hope that her mother was right. For the last year or so, Susannah and Chrissie had been at odds. Not for any particular reason, but over a succession of little things. Susannah felt that her daughter didn’t take life seriously enough. She didn’t put much effort into school and tended to waste time lounging in front of the TV, indulging in long conversations with her friends and sleeping in until noon. Chrissie should have summer employment, but instead of going on a job search, she’d frittered away her spring break, convinced she could charm herself into employment when it suited her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your hair was that blond when you were young,” her mother said wistfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah didn’t want to disillusion her mother, but Chrissie’s pure blond color came courtesy of an expensive salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The minute Joe’s mother set eyes on the baby, she told us Chrissie looked exactly like her aunt Louise,” Susannah commented. Joe had rolled his eyes, but Susannah did see a resemblance. Not then, of course, but more recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s still at school?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Mom, Chrissie’s flying home. Joe’s going to the airport to pick her up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes, you said that, didn’t you? I forget sometimes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all right, Mom, we all do.” She gave her mother’s hand a reassuring pat, then stood. “I’d better bring in my suitcase.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll stay more than a day or two this time, won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mom, I’ll stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile brightened her mother’s dull eyes. “Good. I hoped you would. I’ve been so lost without your father. And now Martha’s left me, too!” She slipped her hand into the pocket of her dress and removed a tissue to dab her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartha had quit! Susannah groaned inwardly as she walked out of the house and opened the trunk of her car. She brought in a large suitcase; assuming she’d be in town for a few weeks, she’d packed more than her usual overnight bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah carried her suitcase down the hallway to her childhood bedroom, which remained exactly as it had when she’d lived at home. Her desk was still there; her chair, too. The heavy blue drapes were the same, although faded, and the lighter blue shag carpeting looked terribly dated now. She couldn’t imagine why her parents had never updated their home after she’d graduated from college. It was as if they’d been stuck in a time warp for the last thirty years. There’d certainly been money to make changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw a friend of yours last week,” her mother said, coming to stand in the bedroom doorway, watching Susannah as she unpacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” Susannah had few friends in town. She’d attended her ten-year reunion, but had felt awkward and out of place. She’d been married to Joe for three years then, and the two of them had stayed at each other’s side. Susannah hadn’t returned for subsequent reunions. She didn’t know these people anymore. Because she’d been away for the last year of school, she hadn’t even graduated with them, not officially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a minute,” her mother said and closed her eyes, forehead creased in thought. “Carolyn!” she said triumphantly. “You remember Carolyn. Carolyn Bronson.” Her mother paused. “She said you should phone her sometime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carolyn Bronson?” Susannah couldn’t believe it. Carolyn had been her best friend and the richest girl in Colville. They’d gone to France together. Her father owned the mill that employed nearly forty percent of the town—or had at one time. With the changes in the lumber industry, Susannah didn’t know how the yard had fared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were good friends with her, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah nodded. “But I haven’t seen Carolyn in years.” Carolyn had been the one friend from Colville she’d stayed in touch with for a while. Then they’d grown apart and their correspondence had dwindled down to an annual Christmas card. About twenty-five years ago, Susannah’s card had come back stamped: MOVED—NO FORWARDING ADDRESS. She hadn’t heard from Carolyn since. Her mother had read in the paper—she regularly studied the obituaries—that Carolyn’s parents were both gone. Susannah hadn’t realized Carolyn was back in Colville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carolyn was so excited when I told her you were coming to town. She said she’d love to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did she happen to mention if she was married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivian shook her head. “She didn’t say, but I think she would have if she was, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn had married shortly after college; it had lasted barely a year. To the best of her knowledge, Carolyn had never remarried. Susannah wondered if the experience of that divorce had left her friend cynical about marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember her mother,” Vivian murmured, pinching her lips. “She always acted as if she was better than the rest of us.” Carolyn’s mother had been a war bride from Paris, and in retrospect Susannah thought she’d never really adjusted to life in a small American town. Carolyn had been an only child, and her mother had insisted her daughter attend high school in France. She and Susannah were friends all through grade school and junior high, and then Carolyn had left for a boarding school just outside Paris. They’d written for a while, but their letters became infrequent as they each made new friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater Susannah’s father had sent her to the same school. Carolyn had been her salvation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Carolyn who’d cried with her when she learned of Doug’s death. Susannah had been inconsolable and desperate to get home. But that wasn’t to be. She was convinced she wouldn’t have survived the rest of that horrible year without her best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the United States, they’d attended separate colleges but stayed in touch. That special bond had lasted through Carolyn’s failed marriage. Then Susannah met Joe and they’d married and the friendship had slowly come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll call her after dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, she gave me her number. It’s unlisted.” Her mother seemed flustered for a moment and then relieved. “I remember now, I put it in my purse so I wouldn’t lose it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did Carolyn move back to Colville?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother blinked several times, as though this was something she should know and didn’t. “I don’t…remember. I don’t recall if she told me.” Changing the subject, her mother motioned toward the chest of drawers. “Should I clean out the drawers so you’ll have some place to unpack your things? Your father put stuff in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Mom, don’t worry about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivian nodded, then shuffled away, presumably to change clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah finished her unpacking. Then, taking the cell phone from her purse, she sat on the edge of the bed and punched the number that would dial her Seattle home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer son answered on the second ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Brian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Mom. How’s Grandma?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s fine. Is your father home yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Chrissie’s here, too. We’ve already had a fight over who got to use the phone.” He lowered his voice and it sounded as if he’d cupped his hand around the mouthpiece. “Apparently she’s on the outs with Jason and she’s in one bitch of a mood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Static,” Susannah said automatically. That was the term she used whenever her children or her students spoke in an unacceptable way. She’d picked up the habit as a fifth-grade teacher. Her kids might consider her old-fashioned, but she didn’t allow them to use foul language, insulting labels or bad grammar, and that wasn’t a rule she planned to change. She said the word static in order to give the child an opportunity to correct his or her mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One hell—heck of a mood,” Brian amended, “but she’s been a real you-know-what since she walked in the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah sighed. “Let me talk to your father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” She heard Brian shout in a voice loud enough to shatter glass. “Dad! It’s Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom.” Chrissie was on the phone first. “I thought you’d be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Chrissie. Grandma needs me right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I need you, too. You should’ve let me know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry you’re disappointed….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad isn’t any help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you and Jason have a falling out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half-second pause. “Brian told you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Susannah could imagine her daughter sending her brother a dirty look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How dare he!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chrissie…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to talk to you. I don’t know what’s wrong, and I think—oh, I don’t know, but I’m afraid Jason’s interested in someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you ask him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie hesitated. “Not directly. I probably should have. He hasn’t phoned yet and he said he would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chrissie, you just got home. Give him a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lengthy silence and Susannah sighed again. “I’m sorry, sweetheart,” she murmured. “I guess all you can do is wait and see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You liked Jason, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very much.” God willing, her daughter would one day marry a man like Jason. Not anytime soon, of course. “You’re upset now, but sleep on it and everything will look better in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you were here,” Chrissie whined. “Why didn’t you take me with you? I love Grandma and I’d like to spend time with her, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I needed to get to Colville as quickly as possible.” Leave it to Chrissie to make her feel even guiltier. She was tired. School had drained her and nothing about her life felt right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad said I had to cook dinner,” Chrissie muttered. “He said that without you here, I’m supposed to take over meals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure Dad would find that helpful.” And since her daughter wasn’t working, she could do something around the house, Susannah thought but didn’t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wants me to be his galley slave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One meal a day, Chrissie, is hardly slave labor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had plans for tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah didn’t want to get into an argument with her daughter. “Let me talk to your father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, but tell him he’s being totally unreasonable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah rolled her eyes toward the ceiling, grateful to have escaped her daughter’s theatrics. Half a minute later, Joe got on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” he said. “How was the drive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. I listened to music the entire way.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/susannah-s-garden-blossom-street-3/page-6.html","bookId":1935,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM"}
