How you going to pay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play games, Keeper, please. Not in the morning, anyhow. You know all the answers, especially to that one. For now, a pouch of moonbrew, dark. And a little quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pouches are for ladies, Suzy. I\u0027ll serve you aloft, you got to meet your marks, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a shrill snarl which swiftly mounted to a scream of rage. Just inside the aft hatch, a pale figure in vermilion culottes and bra - no, wider than that, jacket or short coat - was struggling madly, somersaulting and kicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntering carelessly, likely too swiftly, the slim girl had got parts of herself and her clothes stuck to the hatch\u0027s inside margin and the emergency hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking loose by frantic main force while Spar dove toward her and the brewos shouted advice, she streaked toward the torus, jerking at the ratlines, black hair streaming behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing up with a bong of hip against titanium, she grabbed together her vermilion - yes, clutch coat with one hand and thrust the other across the rocking bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrifting in close behind, Spar heard her say, \"Double pouch of moonmist, Keeper. Make it fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best of mornings to you, Rixende,\" Keeper greeted. \"I would gladly serve you goldwater, except, well - \" The fat arms spread \" - Crown doesn\u0027t like his girls coming to the Bat Rack by themselves. Last time he gave me strict orders to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the smoke! It\u0027s on Crown\u0027s account I came here, to find something he lost. Meanwhile, moonmist. Double!\" She pounded on the bar until reaction started her aloft, and she pulled back into place with Spar\u0027s unthanked help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Softly, softly, lady,\" Keeper gentled, the tiny brown blurs of his eyes vanishing with his grinning. \"What if Crown comes in while you\u0027re squeezing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t!\" Rixende denied vehemently, though glancing past Spar quickly - black blur, blur of pale face, black blur again. \"He\u0027s got a new girl. I don\u0027t mean Phanette or Doucette, but a girl you\u0027ve never seen. Name of Almodie. He\u0027ll be busy with the skinny bitch all morning. And now uncage that double moonmist, you dirty devil!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Softly, Rixie. All in good time. What is it Crown lost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little black bag. About so big.\" She extended her slender hand, fingers merged. \"He lost it here last Playday night, or had it lifted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear that, Spar?\" Keeper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No little black bags,\" Spar said very quickly. \"But you did leave your big orange one here last night, Rixende. I\u0027ll get it.\" He swung inside the torus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, damn both bags. Gimme that double!\" the black-haired girl demanded frantically. \"Earth Mother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the brewos gasped. Touching hands to the side of his head, Keeper begged. \"No big obscenities, please. They sound worse from a dainty girl, gentle Rixende.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth Mother, I said! Now cut the fancy, Keeper, and give, before I scratch your face off and rummage your cages!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, very well. At once, at once. But how will you pay? Crown told me he\u0027d get my license revoked if I ever put you on his tab again. Have you scrip? Or... coins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use your eyes! Or you think this coat\u0027s got inside pockets?\" She spread it wide, flashing her upper body, then clutched it tight again. \"Earth Mother! Earth Mother! Earth Mother!\" The brewos babbled scandalized. Suzy snorted mildly in boredom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one fat hand-blob Keeper touched Rixende\u0027s wrist where a yellow blur circled it closely. \"You\u0027ve got gold,\" he said in hushed tones, his eyes vanishing again, this time in greed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well they\u0027re welded on. My anklets too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But these?\" His hand went to a golden blur close beside her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welded too. Crown had my ears pierced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you atom-dirty devil! I get you, all right. Well, then, all right!\" The last words ended in a scream more of anger than pain as she grabbed a gold blur and jerked. Blood swiftly blobbed out. She thrust forward her fisted hand. \"Now give! Gold for a double moonmist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeper breathed hard but said nothing as he scrabbled in the moonmist cage, as if knowing he had gone too far. The brewos were silent too. Suzy sounded completely unimpressed as she said, \"And my dark.\" Spar found a fresh dry sponge and expertly caught up the floating scarlet blobs with it before pressing it to Rixende\u0027s torn ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeper studied the heavy gold pendant, which he held close to his face. Rixende milked the double pouch pressed to her lips and her eyes vanished as she sucked blissfully. Spar guided Rixende\u0027s free hand to the sponge, and she automatically took over the task of holding it to her ear. Suzy gave a hopeless sigh, then reached her whole plump body across the bar, dipped her hand into a cool cage, and helped herself to a double of dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, wiry, very dark brown figure in skintight dark violet jumpers mottled with silver arrowed in from the dark red hatch at a speed half again as great as Spar ever dared and without brushing a single shroud by accident or intent. Midway the newcomer did a half somersault as he passed Spar, his long, narrow bare feet hit the titanium next to Rixende. He accordioned up so expertly that the torus hardly swayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne very dark brown arm snaked around her. The other plucked the pouch from her mouth, and there was a snap as he spun the cap shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lazy musical voice inquired, \"What\u0027d we tell you would happen, baby, if you ever again took a drink on your own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bat Rack held very still. Keeper was backed against the opposite side of the hole, one hand behind him. Spar had his arm in his lost-and-found nook behind the moonbrew and moonmist cages and kept it there. He felt fear-sweat beading on him. Suzy kept her dark close to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brewo burst into violent coughing, choked it to a wheezing end, and gasped subserviently, \"Excuse me, coroner. Salutations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeper chimed dully, \"Morning... Crown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrown gently pulled the clutch coat off Rixende\u0027s far shoulder and began to stroke her. \"Why, you\u0027re all gooseflesh, honey, and rigid as a corpse. What frightened you? Smooth down, skin. Ease up, muscles. Relax, Rix, and we\u0027ll give you a squirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand found the sponge, stopped, investigated, found the wet part, then went toward the middle of his face. He sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, boys, at least we know none of you are vamps,\" he observed softly. \"Else we\u0027d found you sucking at her ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRixende said very rapidly in a monotone, \"I didn\u0027t come for a drink, I swear to you. I came to get that little bag you lost. Then I was tempted. I didn\u0027t know I would be. I tried to resist, but Keeper led me on. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Crown said quietly. \"We were just wondering how you paid him. Now we know. How were you planning to buy your third double? Cut off a hand or a foot? Keeper... show me your other hand. We said show it. That\u0027s right. Now unfist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrown plucked the pendant from Keeper\u0027s opened hand-blob. His yellow-brown eye-blurs on Keeper all the while, he wagged the precious bauble back and forth, then tossed it slowly aloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the golden blur moved toward the open blue hatch at unchanging pace, Keeper opened and shut his mouth twice, then babbled, \"I didn\u0027t tempt her, Crown, honest I didn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t know she was going to hurt her ear. I tried to stop her, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not interested,\" Crown said. \"Put the double on our tab.\" His face never leaving Keeper\u0027s, he extended his arm aloft and pinched the pendant just before it straight-lined out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s this home of jollity so dead?\" Snaking a long leg across the bar as easily as an arm, Crown pinched Spar\u0027s ear between his big and smaller toes, pulled him close and turned him round. \"How\u0027re you coming along with the saline, baby? Gums hardening? Only one way to test it.\" Gripping Spar\u0027s jaw and lip with his other toes, he thrust the big one into Spar\u0027s mouth. \"Come on, bite me, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpar bit. It was the only way not to vomit. Crown chuckled. Spar bit hard. Energy flooded his shaking frame. His face grew hot and his forehead throbbed under its drenching of fear-sweat. He was sure he was hurting Crown, but the Coroner of Hold Three only kept up his low, delighted chuckle and when Spar gasped, withdrew his foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My, my, you\u0027re getting strong, baby. We almost felt that. Have a drink on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpar ducked his stupidly wide-open mouth away from the thin jet of moonmist. The jet struck him in his eye and stung so that he had to knot his fists and clamp his aching gums together to keep from crying out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s this place so dead, I ask again? No applause for baby and now baby\u0027s gone temperance on us. Can\u0027t you give us just one tiny laugh?\" Crown faced each in turn. \"What\u0027s the matter? Cat got your tongues?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cat? We have a cat, a new cat, came just last night, working as catcher,\" Keeper suddenly babbled. \"It can talk a little. Not as well as Hellhound, but it talks. It\u0027s very funny. It caught a rat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d you do with the rat\u0027s body, Keeper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fed it to the chewer. That is, Spar did. Or the cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean to tell us that you disposed of a corpse without notifying us? Oh, don\u0027t go pale on us, Keeper. That\u0027s nothing. Why, we could accuse you of harboring a witch cat. You say he came last night, and that was a wicked night for witches. Now don\u0027t go green on us too. We were only putting you on. We were only looking for a small laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spar! Call your cat! Make him say something funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Spar could call, or even decide whether he\u0027d call Kim or not, the black blur appeared on a shroud near Crown, green eye-blurs fixed on the yellow-brown ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re the joker, eh? Well... joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKim increased in size. Spar realized it was his fur standing on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, joke... like they tell us you can. Keeper, you wouldn\u0027t be kidding us about this cat being able to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spar! Make your cat joke!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ship-of-shadows/page-3.html","bookId":1609,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:01 PM"}
