{"id":7692,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 5 Words vs. Tone","content":"Say each phrase below with different tonality: anger,boredom, surprise and flirtatiousness. Notice how your| body language, facial expression and breathing combine toalter your emotional state.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s late.\"\"I\u0027ve had enough.\"\"Look at me.\"\"Where were you born?\"To check your tonality, find a friend and say one or twoof these phrases. See if your friend can tell you which ofthe four feelings you\u0027re expressing. If it\u0027s not obvious, keepworking at it until it\u0027s clear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e body will signal to your brain by mixing up a chemicalcocktail that corresponds to the discomfort that theother person is feeling. Then you will both be uncomfortable,and rapport will be that much harder toachieve. When they notice a discrepancy between yourwords and gestures, other people will believe the gesturesand react accordingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, congruity occurs when your body, voice tone andwords are all in alignment. And when your body, tone59and words are communicating the same thing, youwill appear sincere and people will tend to believe you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is why a Really Useful Attitude is so important.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Appearing sincere, or congruent, is a key ingredient forbuilding the trust that opens the door to likability andrapport.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Make sure that your words, your tonality and yourgestures are all saying the same thing. Be on thelookout for incongruity in others. Notice how itmakes you feel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027ve all seen those old movies where a couple ofpeople are driving along in a car, and they\u0027re rocking thesteering wheel even though the background shows aroad that\u0027s straight as an arrow. It\u0027s phonyâ€”you knowthey\u0027re really in a studio being bounced around in a box.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your senses have told you that something isn\u0027t right,something is out of alignment, and so you can\u0027t believewhat you see. Or have you ever had someone get mad atyou and then, in the middle of bawling you out, flash asinister little smile that disappears as fast as it came?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Very chilling. This is another example of incongruentbehavior. The smile doesn\u0027t belong with the anger; it\u0027sinsincere.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Recognizing incongruent behavior is another survivalinstinct. If you\u0027re on vacation and you\u0027re approached60by a complete stranger who grins at you while herubs his hands briskly together, licks his lips andsays, \"Good morning, how would you like to invest inthe world\u0027s best time-share deal,\" the chances are you\u0027llbe on your guard. A quick congruence check is instinctiveand is another reason why first impressions areparamount.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frequently a person\u0027s emotions and intentions aremisunderstood by those around them. For instance, awoman at one of my seminars discovered that sheunconsciously used a tone of voice that was incongruentwith her words. \"No, I\u0027m not confused, I\u0027m interested,\"she would insist when tested. And again, \"No, I\u0027mnot sad, I\u0027m relaxed.\" This went on and on until shecame to the verge of tears and said, \"Now I know why mykids are always saying, \u0027Mom, how come you get mad atus all the time?\u0027 And I\u0027m not mad at them. Sometimes I\u0027mjust excited.\"The same woman also told us that her coworkersaccused her of sarcasm but that, to her, nothing couldbe further from the truth. In fact, sarcasm is simplywords said with conflicting voice tone. It is structuredso the person on the receiving end will believe what\u0027sinferred by the tonality. Suppose you let your teamdown and somebody is heard to quip, \"That was brilliant,\"with a tonality that communicates annoyance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a very different case when you score a fantastic goal61and the same person is heard to say with excitement,\"That was brilliant!\"Congruity, then, has one unshakable rule and it isthis: If your gestures, tone and words do not say thesame thing, people will believe the gestures. Go up tosomeone you know, purse your lips and say, \"I really likeyou,\" with your eyebrows raised and your arms folded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ask them what they think. Even better, go find a mirrorand try it. Well? You get my point. Your gestures are agiveaway to what you really mean.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28323.html","bookId":253,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:55:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:55:23 AM"}
