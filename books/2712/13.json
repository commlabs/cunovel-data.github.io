I know, because I have said them. But for a guy who knows absolutely nothing about how to conduct his own relationships, Tiny Cooper is kind of brilliant when it comes to dealing with other people’s heartbreak. Tiny is like some gigantic sponge soaking up the pain of lost love everywhere he goes. And so it is with Will Grayson. The other Will Grayson, I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane’s a storefront down standing in a doorway, talking on the phone. I look over at her, but she’s not looking at me, and I’m wondering if they played the song. Something Will—the other Will—said right before Tiny and Jane walked up keeps looping around my head: love is tied to truth. I think of them as unhappily conjoined twins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously,” Tiny is saying, “she’s just a hot smoldering pile of suck, but even so, I give her full credit for the name. Isaac. Isaac. I mean, I could almost fall in love with a girl, if she were named Isaac.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Will Grayson doesn’t laugh, but Tiny is undeterred. “You must have been so totally freaked out when you realized it was a porn store, right? Like, who wants to meet there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then also when his namesake was buying a magazine,” I say, holding up the black bag, thinking that Tiny will snatch it and check out my purchase. But he doesn’t. He just says, “This is even worse than what happened to me and Tommy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened with you and Tommy?” Will asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said he was a natural blonde, but his dye job was so bad it looked like a weave from Mattel—like Barbie. Also, Tommy wasn’t short for Tomas, like he told me. It was short for regular old Thomas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill says, “Yes, this is worse. Much worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clearly don’t have much to contribute to the conversation, and anyway, Tiny is acting like I don’t exist, so I smile and say, “I’m gonna leave you two boys alone now.” And then I look at the other Will Grayson, and he’s sort of swaying like he might fall over if the wind kicks up. I want to say something, because I feel really bad for him, but I never know what to say. So I just say what I’m thinking. “I know it sucks, but in a way, it’s good.” He looks at me like I’ve just said something absolutely idiotic, which of course I have. “Love and truth being tied together, I mean. They make each other possible, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid gives me about an eighth of a smile and then turns back to Tiny, who—to be fair—is clearly the better therapist. The black bag with Mano a Mano doesn’t seem funny anymore, so I just drop it on the ground next to Tiny and Will. They don’t even notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane’s standing on the curb on her tiptoes now, almost leaning out into a street choked thick with cabs. A group of college guys walk past and look at her, one raising his eyebrows to another. I’m still thinking about the tying of love and truth—and it makes me want to tell her the truth—the whole, contradictory truth—because otherwise, on some level, am I not that girl? Am I not that girl pretending to be Isaac?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to her and try to touch the back of her elbow, but my touch is too soft and I only get her coat. She turns to me and I see that she’s still on her cell. I make a gesture that is intended to convey, “Hey, no hurry, talk as long as you’d like,” and probably actually conveys, “Hey, look at me! I have spastic hands.” Jane holds up a finger. I nod. She speaks softly, cutely into the phone, saying, “Yeah, I know. Me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step backward across the sidewalk and lean against the brick wall between Frenchy’s and a closed sushi restaurant. To my right, Will and Tiny talk. To my left, Jane talks. I pull out my cell as though I’m going to send a text, but I just scroll through my contact list. Clint. Dad. Jane. Mom. People I used to be friends with. People I sorta know. Tiny. Nothing after the T’s. Not much for a phone I’ve had three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Jane says. I look up, flip the phone shut, and smile at her. “Sorry about the concert,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it’s okay,” I answer, because it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s the guy?” she asks, gesturing toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will Grayson,” I say. She squints at me, confused. “I met a guy named Will Grayson in that porn store,” I say. “I was there to use my fake ID, and he was there to meet his fake boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, if I’d known that was gonna happen, I would’ve skipped the concert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I say, trying not to sound annoyed. “Let’s take a walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. We walk over toward Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile, home to all of Chicago’s biggest, chainiest stores. Everything’s closed now, and the tourists who flood the wide sidewalks during the day have gone back to their hotels, towering fifty stories above us. The homeless people who beg off the tourists are gone, too, and it is mostly just Jane and me. You can’t tell the truth without talking, so I’m telling her the whole story, trying to make it funny, trying to make it grander than any MDC concert could ever be. And when I finish there’s a lull and she says, “Can I ask you something random?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, of course.” We’re walking past Tiffany, and I stop for a second. The pale yellow streetlights illuminate the storefront just enough that through triple-paned glass and a security grate, I can see an empty display—a gray velvet outline of a neck wearing no jewelry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you believe in epiphanies?” she asks. We start walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, can you unpack the question?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like, do you believe that people’s attitudes can change? One day you wake up and you realize something, you see something in a way that you never saw it before, and boom, epiphany. Something is different forever. Do you believe in that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say. “I don’t think anything happens all at once. Like, Tiny? You think Tiny falls in love every day? No way. He thinks he does, but he doesn’t really. I mean, anything that happens all at once is just as likely to unhappen all at once, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t say anything for a while. She just walks. My hand is down next to her hand, and they brush but nothing happens between us. “Yeah. Maybe you’re right,” she says finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you ask?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. No reason, really.” The English language has a long and storied history. And in all that time, no one has ever asked a “random question” about “epiphanies” for “no reason.” “Random questions” are the least random of all questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who had the epiphany?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I think you’re actually, like, the worst possible person to talk to about this,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it was pretty lame of me to go to the concert,” she says randomly. We come to a plastic bench and she sits down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” I say, sitting down next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s actually not okay on, like, the grandest possible scale. I guess the thing is that I’m a little confused.” Confused. The phone. The sweet, girly voice. Epiphanies. I finally realize the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ex-boyfriend,” I say. I feel my gut sinking down like it’s swimming in the ocean deep, and I learn the truth: I like her. She’s cute and she’s really smart in precisely the right slightly pretentious way, and there’s a softness to her face that sharpens everything she says, and I like her, and it’s not just that I should be honest with her; I want to. Such is the way these things are tied together, I guess. “I have an idea,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel her looking at me, and I cinch the hood of my coat. My ears feel cold like burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she says, “What’s the idea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The idea is that for ten minutes, we forget that we have feelings. And we forget about protecting ourselves or other people and we just say the truth. For ten minutes. And then we can go back to being lame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like the idea,” she says. “But you have to start.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/will-grayson-will-grayson/page-13.html","bookId":2712,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:26 AM"}
