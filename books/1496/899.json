When I arouse… I will fight!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose few short words caused a sensation of profound astonishment to fill Bai Xiaochun. In fact, he almost felt as if the words had originated within himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe qi and blood fluctuations within the words were the same as his own. Whoever spoke those words also cultivated the Undying Codex!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Blood Ancestor!” This was the first time he had ever been able to sense any emotions from the Blood Ancestor, despite the fact that he had taken control of his body on multiple occasions in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, he felt the desire to do battle, and could sense his blood coursing madly through his veins. For some reason, it seemed like the Blood Ancestor was calling out to him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to that, he was almost sure that he could sense… other similar fluctuations! They were weaker, and in different areas, but they absolutely contained the same fluctuations!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose fluctuations were coming from two different areas… both within the River-Defying Sect. It only took a moment for him to realize that one of those sources… was the monkey in the River-Defying Sect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other was… the talking rabbit in the Blood Stream Sect!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis realization struck him to the core. As he continued to study the situation, he realized that there were other life force fluctuations in other areas that matched the Blood Ancestor… and all of them were familiar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one location, he saw a bird. In another, a tiger with wings. He saw a huge goose standing guard over something…. How could he ever forget those animals!? They were the very same creatures that had transformed after he fed them his special medicinal pills!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this even possible!?!?” he said with a gasp. He sagged in place, beads of sweat popping out all over his forehead as he ended his session of cultivation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ceasing all activity related to the Undying Blood, his connection to the Blood Ancestor and all of the small animals vanished. A long moment passed, and yet, the look of confusion on his face remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are all of those animals connected to the Blood Ancestor somehow?” All of a sudden, he realized that there was some profound mystery wrapped up in that matter from years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What exactly is going on here…?” he thought. After some more thought, he rose to his feet and rushed over to the Blood Stream Division. Soon, he was standing on the Blood Ancestor’s shoulder!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally speaking, only patriarchs would qualify to get this close to the venerated Blood Ancestor. Therefore, Bai Xiaochun was completely alone. Panting, he reached down and put his hand onto the Blood Ancestor’s skin, and yet, no amount of probing revealed any trace of life force. Bai Xiaochun even began to wonder if what he had sensed earlier had been an illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no way I was mistaken!” he murmured. After a moment of silence, he actually entered the Blood Ancestor’s body, following the familiar route from the past until he was in the heart cavity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime later, he emerged out into the open. His journey… had been completely fruitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold my breath today, awaken tomorrow…. Did the Blood Ancestor… not perish after all?” Mixed emotions filled Bai Xiaochun’s eyes. After the gravekeeper had passed on the mantle of the Hell-Emperor to Bai Hao, and after coming to know the Celestial’s story, Bai Xiaochun’s understanding of the world had changed. He had come to know that there were many secrets he was not privy to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he came to find out that there were even more secrets!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what about Du Lingfei? What was she doing in a tiny place like the Spirit Stream Sect? Was it something to do with the Frigid School of the north? If so, why did she go to the Blood Stream Sect afterward…?” That question had been gnawing at him for years. Although he had come to the conclusion that it had something to do with the true spirit of the Spirit Stream Sect, that baby girl, now he wasn’t so certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there in thought, a haze of thoughts running through his head. Time passed, although he wasn’t sure how much. At one point, a sound like muffled thunder could be heard from one of the mountain peaks in the Spirit Stream Division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sound spread out, countless disciples looked up in shock. It also interrupted Bai Xiaochun’s train of thought, and he looked over at the Spirit Stream Division, his eyes shining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch Spirit Stream….” he murmured. The noise was coming from the secluded meditation facilities, where Patriarch Spirit Stream was attempting to reach the Deva Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocking fluctuations erupted out, as well as an astonishing aura that grew stronger with each passing moment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The patriarch is going to break through!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The River-Defying Sect is going to have another deva!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s definitely going to succeed!” The elders of the sect all hurried over to stand as Dharma protectors, Li Qinghou included. Patriarch Blood Stream and the other two patriarchs were also present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Spirit Stream’s breakthrough was a matter of the utmost importance to the sect. Thankfully, the grand spell formation had just been repaired, and it was activated to ensure that no mishaps occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disciples were trembling with excitement, and praying that everything would turn out well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun buried his thoughts and questions concerning the Blood Ancestor, and focused on the important matter of Patriarch Spirit Stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the unique way he had achieved his own breakthrough, he had not experienced what Patriarch Spirit Stream was currently experiencing, and therefore, couldn’t provide any advice. All he could do was rely on the power of his cultivation base to pay close attention, and be ready to provide any support necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was not for naught that Patriarch Spirit Stream had lived for so many years. After all, he had single-handedly led a tiny sect out of the delta region to the Lower Reaches, a sect which had grown and thrived until it was in its current position in the Middle Reaches. He was the top patriarch in that sect, a person with deep experience, and profoundly qualified in terms of cultivation base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he had lacked in the past was the right opportunity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun had given him that opportunity, and of course, he seized it without hesitation. Rumbling thunder echoed out as Patriarch Spirit Stream’s aura grew stronger. By now, his will had reached the point of being able to almost completely fuse with heaven and earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventy percent. Eighty percent. Ninety percent….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cultivation base fluctuations grew more intense with every moment that passed. As everyone in the River-Defying Sect paid close attention, Bai Xiaochun breathed a sigh of relief, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he did, Patriarch Spirit Stream’s will fused completely with heaven and earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUUUMBLLLE!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clouds seethed, but no heavenly tribulation appeared. There was only a huge face floating high in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was… Patriarch Spirit Stream’s face!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotion was visible in his eyes as he stared down at all the living creatures below….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henceforth… I shall always protect… my home…. The River-Defying Sect!” His voice was filled with determination, focus, faith, and sincerity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Spirit Stream… had just sworn a Dao oath!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as his voice continued to echo out, his will retracted from heaven and earth. He was only a Mortal-Dao deva, but with the extensive preparations he had made over the years, he now surpassed that level by far. He was actually as powerful… as the early Earth-Dao Deva Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disciples of the River-Defying Sect erupted into cheering. And they weren’t the only ones. The Nascent Soul elders joined in, as did the patriarchs from the Blood, Pill, and Profound Stream Divisions. Then, expressions of veneration appeared on their faces as they clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-896\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-898\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-897","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
