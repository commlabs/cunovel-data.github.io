Annal¨ªa stood dazed at the oak desk, the paper in her hand crumpled and damp from her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d waited for his instructions, more nervous than she\u0027d ever been. The last four days had been more nerve-wracking even than when a coach-and-six unexpectedly crunched into the white gravel drive of her school. If a carriage came, no one raised an eyebrow. A carriage meant a day trip. But a coach-and-six struck fear into the hearts of the girls, and they would all tear across the schoolroom to look out from the balcony, praying their family\u0027s crest wouldn\u0027t be emblazoned on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surprise coach-and-six meant some girl\u0027s life was about to drastically change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs drastically as Annal¨ªa\u0027s was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePascal had called for her. The hours had dragged by as she\u0027d awaited his summons, hours made more miserable by hearing the Highlander restlessly stomping all over her home. He\u0027d been like a loosed bull in the manor, which necessitated her behaving like a frightened hare to avoid him. Their game would end tomorrow. The general expected her to join him then and marry him by the week\u0027s end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t even near Pascal, and yet already his hand stretched far to control her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burned the letter in the study\u0027s fireplace then paced until her legs ached and the sun had set, uncaring as to what her father would have thought. Apparently, she couldn\u0027t help it. She remembered another time when she\u0027d been home briefly from school and he\u0027d caught her at it. She\u0027d been sixteen. That time his hard, weathered face had looked grave, his eyes full of pain. \"Elisabet used to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she would have. Everyone always said Annal¨ªa was just like her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Annal¨ªa had first arrived at The Vines, one of the older girls had whispered, \"Watch out for that one with the gardener. She\u0027s Castilian.\" They\u0027d regarded her and determined things about her that she hadn\u0027t recognized at that young age, and they hadn\u0027t even known that Annal¨ªa\u0027s mother had been caught making love to her family\u0027s former stable master. Before and after her marriage to Llorente.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran her fingertips over the choker at her neck. The stone attached was a reminder she was never without -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you pacing?\" The Highlander. His voice was a rumble she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled in irritation, then faced him. Her first impulse was to leave the room, but she\u0027d tired of running in her own home, tired of him taking over everything that was hers, and instead she sat behind the desk. She ignored his question and asked, \"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want whisky. Occurred to me that even you people might have some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes to get her temper under control. When she opened them, he was at the liquor cabinet, noisily opening the crystal decanters, smelling their aromas, then setting them down. The silver tags on each decanter clacked against the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can read the labels rather than smelling each one. That is, if you can read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canna read them in this light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. She\u0027d bought them in Paris for Aleix, delighted with the flourishing engravings, but soon realized they were difficult to decipher even in daylight. Pretty but serving little use. No wonder she\u0027d bought them. She almost laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By all the saints...\" he said, finally finding one that kept his interest. He poured a generous draught into a crystal glass. And placed it directly in front of her. She stared at it as if he\u0027d just positioned some dead thing there, something foul like what the barn cats insisted on gifting her doorstep, and vaguely heard him pouring one for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrink in hand, he sank into the spacious chair across from the desk. Llorente had always wanted whoever was on the other side to feel small and insignificant. She rolled her eyes. Of course, the deep chair fit the Highlander perfectly, and he leaned back, seeming surprised that it suited him so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. He\u0027d shaved. How had he...? He\u0027d pilfered her brother\u0027s belongings! And his cast was gone? She\u0027d probably find the remains of it chewed off beside his bed. Brainless man....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet after Pascal\u0027s letter, she just didn\u0027t have the energy to vent her annoyance. Instead, she stared while he swirled the whisky as if with reverence. His hands were large and callused, but he held the glass gently, his dark gaze fixed on its flickering colors by the candle\u0027s light. When he finally took a drink, he exhaled with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene was like watching someone relish a meringue. Soon all you could think about was eating meringue. She looked on in horror as her hand shook its way to her glass. Brows drawn, she lifted it. She glanced at him; he smirked at her - the horse-thieving Scot - expecting her to back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not drink it? It was imperative to wipe that look from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never touched spirits, never overimbibed rare tastes of table wine. She\u0027d never done anything she shouldn\u0027t have. And look where her life was culminating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pascal\u0027s bride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass shot up to meet her lips, her hand and head tilting far back. Fire rushed down her throat in a long continuous stream. Propriety demanded that she stop. Alas, she and propriety were losing touch. She continued until the glass was drained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefusing to gasp, she stared at him defiantly through watering eyes, then choked back a cough until she could reduce it to a gentle clearing of her throat behind her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A woman who likes her whisky,\" he said while refilling her glass. \"Careful that you doona steal my heart, Annal¨ªa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It figures that the one requirement you\u0027d have for your woman is \u0027whisky drinker.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, but that\u0027s only after \u0027walks upright.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d said the words in his customary low and threatening voice, making it sound cutting, but she felt warm, and her lips slowly tugged into a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her lips, at her smile, and strangely his jaw tensed, bulging at the sides. He had such a squared jaw. Far too masculine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Opposable thumbs rate high as well,\" he said, shooting her a significant glance, but she didn\u0027t know why. Opposable thumbs? She wasn\u0027t familiar with the phrase in English. Her English was flawless, as was her French, Catalan, and Spanish, her vocabulary in each language stellar. For this brute to know something she didn\u0027t rankled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probably made it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the way his gaze moved over her, lingering, with an expectant look, made her blush all the same. She felt it heat her face and creep to her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, he asked, \"What\u0027s the stone you wear at your neck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed her finger over it. \"Peridot. It\u0027s called peridot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen the green-gold color. It matches your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassed, she quickly murmured, \"It was my mother\u0027s. It\u0027s said to have been Cleopatra\u0027s favorite gem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have something in common with the lusty Cleopatra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say I liked the stone,\" she bit out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows at her tone, as if noting her reaction, then changed the subject. \"So whose whisky am I enjoying? Your father\u0027s...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. My father is deceased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inclined his head to her slightly. In a moment of insight, she thought that\u0027s how a gruff Highlander might say, \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother\u0027s, then? The big bastard whose clothes I wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no bastard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudying. \"It\u0027s a figure of speech. No\u0027 literally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face colored again, and she brought the glass to her lips. \"Oh. Yes, it\u0027s his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where is he, leaving you alone like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set the glass down. Had it wobbled? \"He\u0027s away on business, but is expected to return this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he, then? This very week?\" he asked, plainly disbelieving her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that not what I just said?\" She sounded exasperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it you speak English as well as a native? Spanish and French, I understand, but no\u0027 the queen\u0027s English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned at the abrupt change in topic. Polite conversation followed rules. Topics were sequential, orderly, and flowed from one to the next like a gentle current when all those conversing were skilled. Why deliberately disrupt it? She sighed in a put-out way, then replied, \"I went to school abroad and learned it there. English, you might not have heard, is the worldwide language of the nobility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was she\u0027d had to learn it to communicate with many of her schoolmates. The Brits and Yanks couldn\u0027t seem to string together a foreign phrase to save their lives, though everyone else was at least trilingual. Worse, the Yanks polluted the language with irregular phrasings and slang that were difficult to keep pace with. As difficult as they were secretly amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very exclusive. I\u0027m sure you wouldn\u0027t have heard of it.\" She absently tapped her nails against her crystal glass. Apparently, he took that as a sign to refill it. Since it was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called Les Vignes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, The Vines. Just outside of Paris in Fontainebleau.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stopped herself from dropping her jaw. How had he heard of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked. \"Aristocrats and heiresses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" she said in a pained tone. His gloating look rattled her, but also simply thinking about the school made her yearn for her time there. Life had been simple then. She\u0027d loved it there, loved acquiring knowledge, but most important, Annal¨ªa had attained her coveted aura of worldliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this worldliness was, as yet, a fa\u0026amp;ccedil;ade. She\u0027d never been farther north than Paris or farther south than just past the border with Spain. She had never even seen the sea. The Highlander, just by virtue of his traveling from Scotland to Andorra, was worldlier than she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut MacCarrick would never know it because she could put on a grand show. She\u0027d learned contemporary American sass and slang from a princess of railroad royalty, fashionable disdain from a pouty French inheritrix of some medical patent, and British loftiness from a \"fifteenth from the throne\" duke\u0027s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very exclusive,\" she repeated absently. In fact, she\u0027d scarcely been received. Annal¨ªa wasn\u0027t so closely related to a throne, unless you followed Pascal\u0027s insane despot logic, of course. However, she was distantly related to eight of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you were born and raised in archaic Andorra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression felt brittle. She should have known he would cut through the fa\u0026amp;ccedil;ade and go straight to the heart of her insecurities. When she didn\u0027t answer, he continued, \"I\u0027ve always said there are just no\u0027 enough Andorrans in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what makes you so sure I was raised here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard you speak Catalan to the people here. You\u0027ve never spoken it to anyone outside of Andorra, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d yearned to visit other Catalan-speaking countries, but Llorente had forbidden it. \"Why do you ask that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This country hasn\u0027t changed much since medieval times and neither has its language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying I speak with a medieval dialect?\" She couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back and nodded with obvious enjoyment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And with you being a Highlander, I\u0027m sure you recognize medieval when you come across it.\" Ha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips curled at the side. Not quite a smile. \"So the Scot and the Andorran. We\u0027re no\u0027 so different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was decidedly different from everything that he was. \"I\u0027m Castilian,\" she snapped, surprising herself. That information rarely came out sounding like a declaration. Next to a Scot she could be proud of anything, she supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hot-blooded Castilian, then? Collared with Cleopatra\u0027s jewel.\" Never taking his eyes from hers, he lifted his glass and growled over the rim, \"Fascinatin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barely prevented her lips from parting in disbelief. Straight to the heart. How did he manage to brush so closely to her secrets? He didn\u0027t know her. He knew nothing. He was merely provoking for reaction....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next several minutes were odd. If she tilted her head, his eyes narrowed. If she touched her hair, he scrubbed his good hand across the back of his neck. When she drank more, he stilled, as if awaiting something. That was one thing she realized about him - he was always scrutinizing, always weighing, and deciding. She wondered what he\u0027d decided about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere she sat drinking with her worst enemy - well, worst after Pascal - but not because she wanted to be near the man. Certainly not that. And not because she\u0027d forgotten what he was. He was a Highlander, and it was because of people like him and his miserable kinsmen - those cursed killers for hire - that the general had enough power to force her to his will. He was her enemy and she didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d heard that liquor made one brash, but now Annal¨ªa knew it also made one uncaring. Underhanded, even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she would use him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if she could hire him and his men to help her? What if she could tempt him to want to help her? If she was one of those women - if the whispers about her were true - then surely she could have some effect on a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did she have to lose by trying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her courage failed her, she stood, then walked around the desk toward him. When he quickly stood as well, she stopped and reached back for her glass - just one more little sip for courage.... She turned back and he was directly in front of her, looking at her face in his intense, watchful manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a gentle, shuffling step closer, as though he didn\u0027t want to frighten her away. She backed up to the desk, but he kept drawing nearer, surrounding her with his body, with his appealing scent. And some common, base part deep inside her reveled in his size, reveled in the heat she could feel from his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze caught hers, as if he couldn\u0027t stop looking at her. Up so close, she could see how much his eyes had cleared, could see how remarkably dark they were, the irises black like obsidian. And the way he looked at her...as though he was hungry for her. As though he lusted, and understood like no man had before how incredibly much she did, too. She felt like she\u0027d caught fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her palms against the edge of the desk, wrapping her fingers around it, then nervously licked her lips, unsure of what to do. He must have realized she wasn\u0027t leaving, wasn\u0027t moving from this spot, because he appeared baffled, his brows drawn. It was as though she could hear him thinking. She knew he was suspicious of her behavior. She also knew he would decide to enjoy now and figure it out later. As if on cue, his expression changed to one of intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she\u0027d seen women do on bridges across Paris at sunset, she brushed her hands up over his chest and then rested them on the back of his neck. When her fingers twined behind him, his breaths hastened. \"MacCarrick,\" she murmured. \"Do you...like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze was flickering over her face, sometimes resting on her lips, but now meeting her eyes. \"Right now I like you very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threaded her fingers in his hair. \"After tonight, do you want to be my...friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was deep and husky when he said, \"Among other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I trust you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly. \"With this? Aye, I\u0027ll no\u0027 tell a soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned at his comment, but went forward with what she had to do. \"If I asked you for something, would you want to give it to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to stiffen at her question, and a muscle in his cheek twitched. Then she had the impression that he was forcing himself to relax. \"Anna, I will give you something that you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he\u0027d turned her words around, she still murmured, \"MacCarrick...\" He bent lower to hear her better, and she whispered against his ear, \"Kiss me, MacCarrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath against his ear made this mercenary react so strongly? She wondered what her touch might do. If she was the type of woman people accused her of being, then maybe she was also the type of woman who could \"bring a man to his knees.\" She rather liked the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his palm on the back of her head, drawing her in. She thought he would kiss her, but he hesitated, as if to let her body grow accustomed to his, as if savoring that he was about to kiss her as he had savored the whisky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second he placed his lips on hers and slanted his mouth, heat shot through her body. When he kissed down the side of her neck, she sucked in a breath, staggered by the feelings. His hands found her backside and he yanked her into him - hard - until she could feel his erection, huge against her belly. This is wrong -\u0026nbsp; His lips were warm and firm and quelled the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe molded her backside with insistent fingers, squeezing her into him, then grasping her around the waist to - oh, Mare de D¨¦u - move her pelvis against him. Wrong! her mind cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she would pull away, he gathered her closer to kiss her earlobe, and she wondered, mystified, why she\u0027d deemed this so terrible. They weren\u0027t doing more than pressing bodies together. Of course, he wouldn\u0027t make love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she had any comprehension of what he was doing, he\u0027d unfastened the top few buttons of her shirt and would\u0027ve done more if she hadn\u0027t seized the next button in her fist. He made some noise as if her action amused him, but he didn\u0027t continue. He spread what he\u0027d opened, uncovering her upper chest to her chemise, then placed his hands on her back to arch her to him. To her bewilderment, he groaned deeply and rubbed the side of his face against the tops of her breasts. She felt the low guttural sound, and it frightened her, but not more than it exhilarated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows drew together as she watched him - he kissed her skin as if he\u0027d lost himself. That\u0027s what had happened to her - she\u0027d lost herself. Her mind was separate, as if looking on, noting her body\u0027s response as he set her atop the desk to stand between her legs. Her breasts were growing heavy and sensitive, and her own panting breaths sounded loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was embarrassed that he heard her like this, and that he was the cause. Embarrassed that he saw her with her skirts hiked up her legs nearly to her garters and her blouse partially unbuttoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see your hair.\" He rasped the words against her damp skin, and she trembled. \"I know the treasures you hide. I\u0027ve seen them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHazily, she wondered when, but then he kissed at the line of her chemise, and she couldn\u0027t bite back a soft moan, the pleasure was so intense. He raised his face to brush his lips over her ear, and she could feel his warm breath there. He\u0027d begun loosening her hair, and she wanted him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith each kiss, Annal¨ªa wanted to show this brutal Highlander more of her, to bare her breasts and let her hair down so he could run his fingers through it. But when it fell about her, he didn\u0027t touch her so gently. He wrapped the ends around his fist as his lips returned insistent against her neck. His tongue flicked her skin, and her eyes flashed open, then slowly slid closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he tensed and drew back, releasing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Qu¨¨ li passa?\" she murmured. As if coming out of a daze, she opened her eyes and repeated in English, \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard it then - the coming of riders into the manor\u0027s courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" he ordered, his face more menacing than she had ever seen it. \"Lock the door behind me and doona come out for any reason. Do you ken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the space of a heartbeat, the fierce look of intent had vanished, replaced by one of barely controlled fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t answer, he grabbed her shoulders. \"Anna, do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she began, but the voices of several men sounded, just before a pounding on the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were Scottish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking for Courtland MacCarrick,\" a man shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacCarrick relaxed and put his forehead against hers. His hand rested on her face and his thumb stroked her bottom lip. \"They\u0027re no\u0027 known for their timing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore of them? The thought of additional Highlanders traipsing across her property made her insides roil. She prayed Vitale wouldn\u0027t wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the fire in her blood had cooled, shame set in. With fumbling hands she pulled her blouse together and turned her face away. He drew back from her and seemed angered by her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More Highlanders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. We\u0027ll stay until I can ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay?\" She choked out the word. \"They don\u0027t have permission to be on this mountain. You will tell them to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always imperious. One day you\u0027ll learn that I doona take orders. You might also ken that men like me doona appreciate it when lasses like you try to play with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been buttoning her blouse and slowed at his last comment. She knew she\u0027d made a mistake, but still cried, \"But they\u0027re not welcome here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said I was no\u0027 welcome as well,\" he grated in an impatient tone. \"Yet you were moments away from gladly taking me into more than your home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped. \"I was not! A kiss is a far cry from lying with a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0027 just with \u0027a man,\u0027\" he bit out. \"With me.\" He pushed forward once more, forcefully wedging himself between her closed knees. His body was hot against her even through her clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I certainly was not going to!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips curved into a cruel smile. He put his hand against her backside again, trapping her closer, and growled the words, \"I was about to enjoy you on this desk. Rip aside your skirts and take you here like the animal you called me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A-Against my will?\" she responded unevenly, almost rendered speechless by his words. She tried to inch back on the desk. \"Because that\u0027s the only way it would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in to say at her ear, \"No\u0027 against your will. You\u0027d be begging for me inside you.\" He lingered there, as if to make sure she heard him, then lightly touched his face down her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped again, her shame deepening because even his words stirred her, made her want his lips against her breasts again, his breath hot against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he drew back from her, his expression was cold. \"If you ever try to use your wiles on me again, expect that I\u0027ll use you back a thousand times - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Court? Are you in there?\" one of them called from outside. \"Is anybody home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled a long breath, then eased her legs closed to brush down her skirt with great familiarity, as if he knew her, as if they\u0027d done this a hundred times. Strangely, that gesture was more confusing to her than anything he\u0027d done before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me. We will no\u0027 be long here. Just a couple of days.\" He turned to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I should take your word for it?\" she whispered, but he heard her and strode back once more, his hand shooting out to palm the back of her neck and force her to look up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know this, Annal¨ªa. You should never take my word. When you trust me, you will regret it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want them here,\" she said in a low voice. \"Any more than I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression darkened ominously. \"The only thing we respond to is force.\" He raked his gaze over her. \"And you doona have any.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-5.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
