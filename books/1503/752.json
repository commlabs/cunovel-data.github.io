At the very least, I am still the Palace Master right now. According to the rules, the Master can use all of the palace’s resources. Think about it, how old is Zhou Weiqing right now? Moreover, he isn’t like me, who relied on inheriting legacy to gain power. \u0026nbsp;He only relied only on his own cultivation talents. Yes, he is from the Boundless Mainland and will return there for sure. But, isn’t befriending someone who is almost guaranteed to reach the Heavenly God realm in the future far better than keeping a gem that can’t be used many more times? I hope to befriend him. \u0026nbsp;Who knows what kind of support he will give us in the future? \u0026nbsp;By choosing to capture Bing’er, you’ve ruined all of my sacrifices and plans.

If he actually chose to abandon Shangguan Bing’er, not only would they lose him, but they would also have made an enemy out of this young man, who would definitely become a peerless powerhouse in the future. Thus, it was simpler to return Bing’er to him in order to improve their relationship and let him leave quickly.
