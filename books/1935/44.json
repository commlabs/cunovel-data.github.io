Now it was up to Susannah to decide what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have that kind of money here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted one shoulder in a half shrug. “Then get it from your husband and do it fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah’s mind raced. Joe would never give in to blackmail. She knew without even asking that he’d flatly refuse. “He won’t agree to this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then the deal’s off.” Troy started to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she cried. She took him at his word—this was a one-time offer. “I’ll find a way to get the money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about your rich friend?” Troy suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah shook her head. “I’d never borrow money from Carolyn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows in a cynical expression. “Not even for your daughter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be waiting at the Roadside Inn tonight at seven. Either you’re there with the money or no deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I might not have it by then,” she began. “I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That,” he said, his voice as hard as steel, “is your problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah paced the house, figuring out ways to come up with the money. She couldn’t go to an ATM—there was a thousand-dollar limit on withdrawals. She and Joe had a joint account, and she doubted she could take out that amount, anyway, without his permission. A credit card advance? She went over and over the possible solutions until Chrissie returned with the car. Her daughter, in high spirits, was full of chatter and good will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma looked great,” Chrissie assured her. “She was almost like her old self, except…” She giggled. “She thought I was you. The nurse said that’s common and I shouldn’t worry about it. She’ll be herself in no time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did the doctor say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie stopped to think. “Not much, really, just that Grandma’s making progress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah prayed her mother would make a full recovery. Otherwise, they’d be looking at a hip replacement. From various friends she’d learned how serious that could be with the elderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie studied her. “Don’t worry about Grandma, Mom. She’s doing really well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding seemed to require a monumental effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is something else bothering you?” Chrissie asked with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really…It’s just that I’ve got an errand to run and I have to wait for the home security people.” She’d decided to see Carolyn—to at least discuss this with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go,” she urged. “I’ll stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter’s willingness to help added a sense of urgency to Susannah’s mission. Without a hint of regret, Troy would destroy Chrissie’s life. Paying him off might solve the problem, but she wasn’t convinced Troy could be trusted. She didn’t dare give him all the money up front, or she’d have no insurance. But even half of $5000 was hard to produce on such short notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn was busy with a buyer when Susannah arrived. Waiting in the small reception area, she gazed out the window over the massive yard, stacked with row upon row of timber. The noon whistle blew, and the work crews broke for a thirty-minute lunch. The saws went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah watched as the men poured out from various places and congregated together. In the distance they looked alike, some short, some tall, but all dressed in the same style coveralls. These men were the fathers, husbands, brothers of many people in Colville, and Susannah was visibly reminded of the mill’s importance to the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to Carolyn’s office opened then, and Susannah heard her friend exchanging farewells with the buyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Susannah?” Carolyn said behind her. “You wanted to see me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTearing her gaze away from the window, she turned to her. “Do you have a few minutes to talk privately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Carolyn led the way back into her office; Susannah followed and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn’s eyebrows went up as she rounded her desk and reclaimed her chair. “Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting down opposite her, Susannah nodded. “I had a visitor this morning.” She swallowed hard, then continued. “Troy Nance came to see me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take it this wasn’t a social call?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah made a derisive sound. “Hardly. I took Chrissie out to the Roadside Inn last night, but it didn’t do any good. He knows I’m on to him, so he came to tell me that for a mere five thousand dollars he’d break off his relationship with Chrissie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’d what?” Carolyn yelped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not even the worst of it. Troy claimed the reason he got involved with her is because his mother thought I was—and I quote—a stuck-up prig in high school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Carolyn sounded as shocked as Susannah had been. “We both know that Jake broke up with her because of you and she never got over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah agreed. Sharon had been caustic the evening they’d driven out to the tavern, claiming that Jake had gone back to her. She’d taken pleasure in informing Susannah that Troy was his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure. My gut tells me to pay him the money and be done with it.” It occurred to her then that she was doing almost the same thing her father had done. Another thought hit her and with it her stomach twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Carolyn asked in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah shook her head numbly. “What if…what if Jake’s father approached my dad and demanded money?” she whispered. It had never entered her mind that Allan Presley might have done exactly that. Now she wondered. In her heart she knew it hadn’t been Jake’s idea, but she’d assumed her father was the one responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn’s eyes were wide. “I never thought of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sinking sensation didn’t leave her. Her mind whirled with the possibility and she didn’t immediately realize Carolyn was speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did Joe say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah looked away. “I didn’t tell him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn frowned at that. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I know my husband and he’d never agree to this. He’s probably right, but I have to do something… I’m desperate. My daughter’s future is at stake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn’s frown darkened. “Do you think keeping Joe out of this is a good idea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I just don’t know.” Her voice shook with near hysteria. That wretched man was risking Chrissie’s future, without conscience, without regret and without a qualm. His threat hadn’t been subtle—he’d introduce her to his friends. Susannah could easily guess what that meant. His friends had to be big-time losers. Even more disturbing was the implication that Chrissie would be hanging around with…with drug addicts and given cocaine or who knew what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Susannah had no choice but to broach the subject of money with Carolyn. Drawing in a deep breath, she leaned toward her friend’s desk. “There’s a problem. I don’t have five thousand dollars just lying around.” She didn’t wait for Carolyn to comment, fearing what she’d say. “I suppose I could get a cash advance on the credit card, but I’d rather not tell Joe about this if I can possibly keep it secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn’s chest rose with a harsh sigh. “Troy is blackmailing you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you should talk this over with your husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah wanted Joe at her side more than ever, and yet she knew beyond a doubt that he wouldn’t agree to this. She couldn’t risk it, even at the cost of her marriage. When everything was settled, when Chrissie was safe, she’d tell him, but not before—otherwise they might lose their daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going behind Joe’s back isn’t right,” she agreed, “but for now and for Chrissie’s sake, it’s my only option.” Opening her purse, Susannah set out the emerald ring Joe had given her on their twentieth anniversary. He’d paid twenty-five hundred dollars for it. In addition, she had her mother’s pearls, which Vivian had given her for safekeeping. Taken together, she believed their value would total at least the amount she needed to borrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was hoping,” she said, the words barely making it past the constriction in her throat, “that it would be possible to get a loan from you.” Asking to borrow money was even harder than she’d imagined. Her face burned with mortification. “These are worth more but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me to write you a personal check for the five thousand,” Carolyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah hung her head. “The jewelry’s the collateral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a short pause, Carolyn slowly straightened and opened a drawer, pulling out her checkbook. “I don’t think you’re doing the right thing in keeping this from Joe, but you’re the one who has to make that decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak with relief, Susannah nodded. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’d rest easier if at some point you told your husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will, I promise, just not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn wrote the check and handed it to Susannah. Then she turned to her computer and typed up a simple IOU. “I don’t want to take the jewelry. You keep it. The note is enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah thanked her, signed the note and took back the ring and pearls. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate this,” she said, on the verge of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just hope Chrissie appreciates what you’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod willing, she’d never find out. “I don’t want her to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t going to tell her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah shook her head emphatically. “No way! She’d never forgive me. Sure as anything, she’d blame me for this. I can’t take that chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if Troy comes back for more money later on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah had considered this. “I don’t think he will. He said Chrissie’s become a drag. He’s bored with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on Carolyn’s face was one of disgust. Susannah shared her opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she left, she thanked her friend profusely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie was busy packing up the hallway linen closet when Susannah got back to the house. “The alarm guy was here,” she said, still on her knees, a stack of pillowcases in her arms. “It’s the same alarm system we have at home. I gave him your birthdate, month and day, for the code.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea,” Susannah mumbled. Now that the problem of finding the money had been solved, she should feel good. She didn’t; if anything, she felt worse. Carolyn disapproved of the risk Susannah was taking, but she hadn’t offered any alternatives, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom? Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the second time that day her daughter had asked that question. Susannah forced a smile. “Of course I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie set the pillowcases neatly inside a carton. “This is about Troy, isn’t it?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/susannah-s-garden-blossom-street-3/page-44.html","bookId":1935,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM"}
