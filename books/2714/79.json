I’d probably been avoiding them for too long, so I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother’s request was short and simple, and no way could I deny her, so I mumbled out a couple okay’s, sure’s, and yeah’s before I said, “See you then. ’Kay. Bye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy change in mood must’ve been obvious because Caroline touched my arm, making me jump from the unexpected contact. “Hey. Everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm.” I tried to send her a smile that said everything was just peachy, but as I looked into her concerned blue eyes, an idea struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” I pointed. “You. I need you. Tonight. Do you think you could be my fake girlfriend for the evening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, the pause in her answer making me instantly itchy. “Your what girlfriend?” she said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, I worked my neck around to pop it. “That was my mom. I’ve been summoned home to eat with them tonight to, you know, celebrate my graduation this weekend, or something. I really, really don’t want the usual fucking talk. So I thought if I had you by my side, they’d not hound me about...other crap and just be excited I brought a real, live girl to supper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips tightened with displeasure. “Do you have a habit of bringing the blow-up kind to supper?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Caroline.” I groaned through my teeth. “This is serious. Do you think you can not be a smart-ass for three freaking seconds and say, why yes, Oren, I’d love to go with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she said, “Are you sleeping with other girls?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I shook my head, utterly confused. “What in all the shit I just said prompted you to ask that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you wanted me to be your fake girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?” I nodded, still clueless. “So?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So...” She frowned at me. “If I’m not a real girlfriend now, then what the hell am I to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth opened, but no words came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. I hadn’t even thought of labels and crap like that. “Uhhh...” I said, not sure how to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong fucking thing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline stuffed her phone into her bag. Zipping it shut, she surged to her feet. “You know that thing I just said about you being sweet? I take it all back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn’t stop her, she was going to stomp off, and that would be the end of any more midnight visits for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” I popped to my feet after her. “Jesus, I haven’t even thought about this shit. I’ve just been so busy enjoying what we have, I haven’t exactly stopped to pin a label on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, her eyes intent as she studied me. “Do labels scare you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, yes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. “Hell, no. I just...” I tossed out a hand. “I haven’t had a true, honest girlfriend in over four years. I...I’m rusty at, you know, monogamy and commitment and shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her arms over her chest and continued to stare with that stare of hers, the one that told me I was in deep monkey squirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fidgeted under her inspection. After shifting my weight from one leg to the other, I glanced around the busy quad. “Should we really be discussing this so openly...around so many ears?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head sadly, she snorted out her disgust and started to stride away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right on her heels. “I’m sorry, okay. Please, Caroline. You know I’m an ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled lightly. “And yet, shame on me, I keep putting up with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no one else but you. You know that. I don’t know what I was thinking saying all that fake bullshit. I’ve been single so long it’s hard to remember I’m really, honestly in a relationship now. And besides, since we have to keep it under wraps and I have to act like I’m single around certain people, I didn’t know if the usual rules applied, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowed to a stop before turning around, her eyes filled with torment. “Does the secrecy thing negate any chance of this being a normal relationship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” I shrugged, worried as hell I was going to say the wrong thing, again. “You tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, obviously, you have your own ideas of what we aren’t. So now I need some clarification. Are we just friends with benefits, or are we actually a couple? Have you not been with any other girls because you just haven’t had the opportunity, or because you’re actually being faithful to me? Because I need to know before I start thinking things.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-79.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
