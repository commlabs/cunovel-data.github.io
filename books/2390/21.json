Perhaps Team A killed the Hanna, Aria, Spencer, and Emily clones after the video had been made so they’d never talk. It was hard to tell the extent of their madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door slammed somewhere down the hall. The air conditioner kicked back on, and the sharp smell of stale coffee suddenly wafted through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should get someone to check out this Lychee Nut hotel,” Emily suggested. “Was this really their video footage? Why would they have had a murder on tape the whole time and not come forward with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s obvious the tape was planted,” Hanna said. “But who do we have on the outside to actually investigate this for us?” On the outside. She wasn’t even in prison yet and she was already using the lingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna jumped. Spencer’s father poked his head inside. “Your bail has been posted. You’re all free to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are?” Emily didn’t get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your arraignment is in one month.” Mr. Hastings held the door open for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what?” Aria asked nervously. “We come back here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Hastings gritted his teeth. “Don’t freak out, but we just found out that they want to extradite you to Jamaica.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Spencer exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna pressed a hand to her chest. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s where you committed your crime. Your trial will be there, and you’ll serve your sentence there, too, if you’re convicted. That’s what they’re pushing for, anyway.” Mr. Hastings looked furious. “We’re doing everything we can to change it, though. It’s bullshit. They’re just trying to make an example of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bomb went off in Hanna’s brain. The prospect of spending the rest of her life in an American prison was bad enough, but spending it in a Jamaican one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed the lawyer out of the conference room, her heart hammering. They walked down a long hallway. Mr. Hastings opened the door that led into the lobby. Hanna blinked in the brightness of the front room, then looked around at everyone waiting. When Mrs. Hastings saw Spencer in handcuffs, she burst into tears. To her left were Mr. and Mrs. Fields, looking shocked and pale. Next to them were Aria’s parents, though no Mike. Hanna’s mom was next to them. Hanna looked around for her dad but didn’t see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s mother ran up to her. “Let’s get you out of here, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hanna was still looking around. “Dad’s here, too, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Marin held Hanna’s hand and steered her through a sliding door. They came to a desk, and a guard asked her to sign some papers. The guards gave Hanna back her belongings, including her phone. Hanna checked the messages and texts. Lots of worried texts from Mike but nothing from her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom.” She placed her hands on her hips. “Where is Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Marin handed the papers back and took Hanna’s arm. “I brought a scarf for you to put over your head when we go outside. There’s a lot of press out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s heart banged faster. “He knows about this, doesn’t he? Why isn’t he here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Ms. Marin stopped halfway down the hall. She looked positively heartbroken. “Honey, he couldn’t risk the bad publicity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna blinked. “D-did you talk to him? Is he worried about me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother swallowed hard, then slung an arm around Hanna’s shoulders. “Let’s get you in the car, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed Hanna a scarf, then pushed through the exit door. At least twenty reporters and cameramen swarmed toward them, flashbulbs popping, video cameras pointed, microphones poised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions came fast and furious. “Ms. Marin, did you know your daughter did it?” “Hanna, how do you feel about being extradited to Jamaica?” “Ms. Marin, is your ex-husband going to withdraw from the Senate race?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna knew that if her father were here, the press would be asking him these questions instead. But not-so-deep-down, she didn’t care. He should be here. Who cared about his campaign at a time like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked through tears and clung even tighter to her mother’s arm, suddenly more grateful for her mom than she’d been in years. Ashley Marin bulldozed through the press, not letting them take even one decent picture of her daughter, not uttering a word except for “No comment” to the leechlike reporters. She didn’t ask Hanna if she did it or not. She didn’t give Hanna shit or think of ways to spin this so it benefited her. That, Hanna realized, was how a parent was supposed to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was what she needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE’S DEAD TO US\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily had returned to her house after a fair share of trouble—Ali’s death, A outing her at a swim meet, her banishment to Iowa, her secret baby coming to light. Each of those homecomings had been stilted and strange, but nothing, nothing was like returning to the Fields abode after being arrested for murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer family was silent the whole ride home. Her mother stared straight ahead, unblinking, and her father gripped the steering wheel so hard, his knuckles were white. Only once did Emily dare to protest her innocence, but her parents hadn’t responded. Her phone buzzed, and she looked at it. To her astonishment, Jordan had sent her a private message. I’m so disappointed in you, Em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily recoiled. Had Jordan heard? Did she actually believe the news?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an Instagram attached to the message. Emily thought it would be a still shot of the fake video, but instead a shadowy photo of her on a dance floor appeared. Emily held a champagne flute in her hand. A pretty black girl spun her around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePegasus? Emily dropped the phone to her lap. The night with Carolyn at the bar. The dance with River. Who had snapped and posted this? Ali?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers hovered over the keyboard. It’s not what it looks like! she wrote. We were just dancing. I still love you, I promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jordan didn’t write back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fields house was cold, and most of the lights were off. Emily followed her parents inside the kitchen and clapped eyes on Carolyn, who was bustling around gathering silverware and plates from drawers and cupboards. Her heart lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Carolyn didn’t even meet Emily’s gaze. “I have Chinese,” she announced in a brisk voice, plopping a large paper bag on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Fields’s brow furrowed. “How much did that—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine, Mom,” Carolyn cut her off, then slammed a bunch of forks down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily took a few more forks from the pile and placed them at the rest of the seats. She glanced at her sister. “You know this is a huge mix-up, right? Someone framed us for killing that girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn turned away. Emily’s heart slowly began to sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited until everyone else had served themselves lo mein and kung pao chicken, then took a paltry amount of fried rice and sat in her normal chair. The only sounds were chewing and the scraping of knives and forks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes. How could Fuji think they killed not only Tabitha but Gayle and Graham, too? And why was Fuji so convinced, suddenly, that Ali was dead? Emily wished she could talk to the agent, but Mr. Hastings had forbade them from saying a word to anyone except for the legal team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to try again, turning back to Carolyn. “We think it was Ali, actually. She’s alive. We were afraid that Tabitha Clark was Ali, in fact . . . but she wasn’t, and . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn looked desperately at their father. “Dad, tell her to stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carolyn, I’m telling the truth.” Emily knew she should shut up, but she couldn’t control her mouth. “Ali survived. It’s really her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around at her family, wishing someone would say they understood. But everyone was staring at their plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang. Everyone’s heads swiveled toward the hall, and Mr. Fields stood to answer it. There were low murmurs, and then the front door slammed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily got up from the table and peered through the front window. Two tow trucks sat in the driveway. A man in a blue jumpsuit hitched the Volvo wagon to the tow, and a balding guy in a black jacket did the same with the family’s minivan. Mr. Fields just stood there on the lawn, hands in his pockets, a forlorn expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are our cars being taken away?” Emily called to her mom in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer. She walked back into the room. Mrs. Fields and Carolyn picked at their meals. Emily’s heart started to pound. “Mom. What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is she asking that?” Carolyn’s voice rose in pitch. “How could she not know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked back and forth at them. “Know what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Fields’s jaw was clenched tight. “We had to sell both cars and use the money we got to pay your bail,” she said calmly. “Among other things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked hard. “You did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn leapt up from the table and walked over to Emily. “What did you expect? You killed someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething exploded in Emily’s brain. “N-no, I didn’t!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn’s nostrils flared. “We saw you on that video. You looked like a monster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That wasn’t me!” Emily glanced desperately at her mother. “Mom? You believe it wasn’t me, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Fields lowered her eyes. “That video. It was so violent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked at her imploringly. Did that mean her mom believed her . . . or she thought she’d done it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn sniffed. “All your lies have finally caught up to you. But we’re paying the consequences. We might even lose the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily walked back to the window and stared at her father, who was standing with his back to her, facing the tow truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to have to get a job—that is, if anyone will even hire me,” Carolyn said from the kitchen. “All because of you, Emily. It’s always about you, isn’t it? You’re always ruining everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Fields kneaded her temples. “Carolyn, please. Not now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn slapped the table hard. “Why not now? She needs to understand. She doesn’t live in the real world, and I’m really sick of it.” She faced Emily. “It’s always an excuse with you. Your best friend was murdered. You were getting text messages from Mona Vanderwaal, who I personally saw you guys make fun of when Ali was alive. But hey, it’s different when you’re bullied, huh? Everyone’s just supposed to drop everything and treat you like some sort of delicate flower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily walked back to the table. Her jaw dropped. “Are you kidding me? She tried to kill us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn rolled her eyes. “And when you get pregnant, you don’t actually face up to it. Nope, you hide in Philly. You use me all summer, make my life hell, and then, afterward, it’s all about you, how I hurt you, how I should have just accepted what you were going through without being upset or afraid or anything.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deadly-pretty-little-liars-14/page-21.html","bookId":2390,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:50 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:50 AM"}
