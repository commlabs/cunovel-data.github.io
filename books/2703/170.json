Glad you didn’t die. Ham probably would’ve become a pain in the ass to live with if you had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chest shook as she laughed softly. “I imagine he would have.” Her smile settled into a gaze of adoration. “You’re seriously never going to call me Zoey, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen shrugged. “Probably not.” His eyes filled with a pain I’d never seen in him before. Glancing away, he mumbled what sounded like, “That was my sister’s name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey’s smile died. “Was?” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat and met her gaze before nodding. “Yeah. Was.” With a wince, he shook his head. Then he leaned down swiftly and stamped a quick kiss to her forehead. “I better go. I’ve got a fucking family thing I should probably go suffer through before the holiday’s over. Just…take care of yourself, will you? And make sure this asshole takes care of you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Zoey let go of his hand and watched him stride from the room. Then her concerned gaze found mine. “Did you know he had a sister named Zoey who died?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, in just as much shock as she was in. “I had no idea he’d even had a sister.” Much less that her name had been Zoey, or that she’d died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor Ten. I wonder how he was ever able to talk to me at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile lit up my face. “Easy. How could anyone not talk to you? You’re a freaking angel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted and rolled her eyes, but the smile that followed told me how much she loved the praise. “I love you,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her knuckles. “Not as much as I love you. In a way, I’m glad you decided to come to Ellamore and give away one of your kidneys, because it brought you to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what,” she slurred, “So am I. Thank God my half-sister is an evil, conniving witch, or we never would’ve met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, we laughed softly. We’d discovered that finding a way to laugh and make light of it was easier to handle than the cold, dark truth: Cora was evil, and Zoey would always be connected to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey’s eyelashes fluttered, and I knew she needed rest. I was about to tell her to get some sleep while I kept watch over her, but someone knocked softly on the opened doorframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Cora’s father. I straightened and stiffened indignantly, but Zoey’s grip on my fingers warned me to behave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” she said simply, not welcoming him, but not giving him the cold shoulder either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” His gaze softened as he glanced over at her and stepped hesitantly into her room. “So, I see you made it through okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey nodded. “How’s Cora?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitched into a half grimace, half smile. “She made it through surgery as well. So far her body is accepting your kidney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey’s shoulders eased. “Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer biological father glanced away and cleared his throat. “I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am…for everything.” When his green gaze met hers, her fingers clamped even tighter around mine. “If I had known what Cora was doing earlier, I would’ve put a stop to it long ago. I can only assure you that she won’t bother you again…” His gaze flickered my way. “She won’t bother either of you. She’s always had a strong will and wanted her own way. Just like her mother. It’s been a challenge to keep her even moderately in line. And...” He sighed and glanced down at his hands, touched his wedding ring before he kept talking. “I probably shouldn’t have allowed her so much contact with you when you started high school. I knew she’d end up trying to control you. She does that with everyone. But...” He gave a half shrug. “I guess I was curious about you, too. Please believe me when I say you don’t have to worry about her again. If there’s one thing she listens to and respects, it’s money. And since I control hers, I can keep her away from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Zoey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And about…about Ernest.” Shaking his head, he glanced away in shame. “It’s troubled me for years, knowing how he treated you. But my marriage and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to explain anything,” Zoey broke in, wincing when she probably tensed enough to pull something she shouldn’t have. I moved to remove Mr. Wilder from her room, but she tightened her grip on my hand, stopping me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-170.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
