Just hearing his name, the moisture in Bride\u0027s mouth increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Ann, by the way,\" the redhead said. \"The brunette is Claire, and the blonde is Madison.\" As she spoke, she wrapped the self-tightening tourniquet around Bride\u0027s arm and cleaned the inside of her elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s Devyn got to do with everyone wanting to meet me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He decorated your cell,\" Madison said, her tone making it clear that should have been obvious to Bride. \"Everything here, he picked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did what?\" She had thought it odd that AIR had spent so much money on a real oak dresser and a mattress made from true feathers, but she\u0027d never suspected Devyn\u0027s involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn lifted a butterfly needle. \"We were set to buy the cheapest stuff we could find—sorry, but it\u0027s true—when he told us not to bother, that he\u0027d buy what you needed with his own money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he do such things? She was nothing to him. He was already dating other women. Not that he\u0027d ever taken Bride on a date. And not that she would have said yes if he had. Really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn pushed the sharp needle into her vein, blood slowly, too slowly, filling the tube attached to the other end. \"Dallas told me he heard Devyn call you sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. So.\" Devyn had an endearment for everyone. \"He\u0027s only ever called me darling,\" Claire said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. Darling this and darling that. He calls Eden Black pet, and he\u0027s obsessed with her, but he\u0027s never called her sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride\u0027s teeth and nails sharpened dangerously. \"Obsessed with her? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s Rakan, and he\u0027s never had a Rakan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounded like something Devyn would say. I want to kill Eden Black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, anyway, he tortured that human for you.\" Claire stepped around the table and eyed Bride questioningly. \"Even cut his head off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But only because I had something he wanted.\" She couldn\u0027t keep the bitterness from her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison, too, veered around and faced her. \"Honey, he pursued me for a week—that\u0027s the most I could resist him, and the most time he\u0027d give me. He\u0027d already moved on to someone else when I threw myself at him to regain his attention. Anyway, during that week he heard my partner berate me, call me names. Believe me, I had something he wanted, too, but he didn\u0027t kill Tate for me. Didn\u0027t even yell at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. \"You\u0027ve been with Devyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling happily, Madison nodded. So did Ann and Claire. Bride\u0027s eyes widened. \"All of you have been with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nearly every female agent in AIR,\" Ann said, and she didn\u0027t sound upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why that... that... man-whore!\" Bride had known he was promiscuous, but damn. Was there no one he wouldn\u0027t screw? Probably not. Besides Bride. Her, he pleasured with his fingers and his mouth but didn\u0027t penetrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn\u0027t he taken her? She\u0027d been willing. Much as she would have liked to deny that, she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tourniquet loosened on its own, and Ann tugged it from Bride\u0027s arm. She withdrew the needle with one hand and placed a bandage over the puncture wound with the other. \"So tell me. What was he like? With you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three women leaned in close, their heartbeats suddenly a roar in her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride squirmed in her seat, sweating, now having trouble catching her breath. Her gaze locked on Ann\u0027s pulse, and even more moisture flooded her mouth. The agent\u0027s skin appeared soft, her vein full. One little nibble wouldn\u0027t—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArgh! No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bride?\" one of them said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, bringing them back in focus. No blood. Not now. They were still staring at her, waiting. Waiting for information about Devyn. She knew they wanted to compare her experiences with their own so they could feel better about how he\u0027d treated them. Fine. She\u0027d give them all the gory details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He nearly blinded me with that glowing skin thing,\" she said stiffly. \"I mean, really. How annoying is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He glowed?\" Claire asked, brow puckering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three women shared a strange look, as though silently asking each other if Devyn had glowed for them. Each one shook her head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t glowed for them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us more,\" Madison pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words tumbled from her before she could stop them. \"He tried to make me beg for it, but I refused. He gave it to me anyway, but he wouldn\u0027t let me leave afterward. And when I tried to walk away, he tightened his hold. Talk about frustrating!\" See, she wanted to shout. He\u0027s not a prize. He was domineering and too determined to have his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, the women straightened. They shared another look. A look of wonder, this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she demanded, wiping at the sweat on her brow with the back of her wrist. Her hand was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn was the first to shake off the awe. \"He held you? After he finished with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Why were the lights in the cell suddenly winking on and off? Light, dark, light, dark. And why didn\u0027t the agents seem to notice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t get his clothes on fast enough with me,\" Madison said with a pout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two seconds after he came, he thanked me and rolled from the bed,\" Claire said. \"He was out the door a minute after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth females sounded like they stood at the end of a tunnel, their voices thick and distant, slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did me up against a wall and patted my head when he was done. Then he walked away and never looked back.\" Ann sounded closer, but no less slurred. \"\u0027Course, I couldn\u0027t chase him because I was boneless, completely sated.\" She paused. \"Bride, are you okay? Don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but you look terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched her with expectation, waiting for her reply. About Devyn? About her health? She didn\u0027t know what to say. Clearly they thought it was a miracle that Devyn had stayed with her after his climax, but they couldn\u0027t know that he\u0027d had nowhere else to go. That he\u0027d been waiting for Macy. That he hadn\u0027t trusted Bride to stay put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like her, not the way they thought. Otherwise, he wouldn\u0027t have gone on a date with another female. He would have been here, claiming his kisses. Feeding her that delicious blood. Blood ... Need blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDizziness flooded her mind, her thoughts breaking apart, unable to realign themselves. Where was she? What was happening to her? She pushed to shaky legs, but they were too weak to hold her weight, and she crashed into the cold concrete floor. A sharp pain exploded in her temple, and the world around her blackened completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your eyes, sweetheart.\" Word of Bride\u0027s collapse had spread through AIR quickly, and Devyn had come running. Though he\u0027d forced himself to remain outside headquarters these last three days, he\u0027d never strayed far from the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even for the date he\u0027d called a halt to half an hour into. He\u0027d taken an agent to dinner, but before the appetizer had even arrived, he\u0027d tossed a wad of cash on the table and left. Hadn\u0027t been right. Hadn\u0027t felt right. Bride was being drained, and he was out having fun. Well, not fun. He\u0027d been miserable, unable to charm or flirt with his intended partner for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know who he was anymore, or what he wanted. No, not true. He wanted Bride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if, when she\u0027d kissed him and come on his fingers, she\u0027d changed him. As if she\u0027d somehow planted stronger seeds of obsession in his brain, and those seeds were now growing. He didn\u0027t know how to act anymore. Didn\u0027t know what to do with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself thinking about her at the oddest moments. Like when he was on a date with another woman. Like when he was in the car and reached a traffic light flashing green. Like when he\u0027d cut his fingertip and wiped the blood away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat claimed the bulk of those thoughts was the fact that there\u0027d been pain mixed with her pleasure. When she\u0027d climaxed, she\u0027d screamed, and it had not only been because of his exceptional skill. He wanted to know why she\u0027d hurt and how to prevent it next time. For there would be a next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bride,\" he said more firmly. She was too pale, too still. He knew beyond a doubt she hadn\u0027t eaten in days. He\u0027d kept tabs on her, and also knew she\u0027d thrown up her one and only bag of plasma. \"Wake up, and I\u0027ll let you slap me around. You know you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moan slipped from her, soft, barely discernible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the thought of hurting him physically had been the thing to rouse her. Her lashes fluttered open, casting flickering shadows on her cheeks. Those hazel irises were glazed, dull, but when they latched on to the pulse at his neck, they lit, swirled, once more like living emeralds, glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d moved her to the bed, and he was stretched beside her, his head resting on his upraised palm. \"You need to eat, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately her hands pushed at him. \"Get away from me.\" The words were slurred, thick. Her gaze never left his neck. \"You have to get away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink from me. Hurry, or dinner\u0027s gonna get cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go. Please, go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until you drink. It\u0027s an all-you-can-eat buffet tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tsked. \"I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re so stubborn about this. You\u0027re hungry. I\u0027m willing. Maybe you\u0027ll be able to keep it all down. Which wouldn\u0027t surprise me. It\u0027s mine, after all, so there\u0027s clearly none better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want your blood,\" she said, trying to scramble away herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t, did she? His eyes narrowed. They\u0027d see about that once he prodded her temper. \"Guess what? I took a female on a date. An agent. A six-armed Delensean. I haven\u0027t had one of those in years. The prospect of having one again amused me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she snarled, some of her color returning. \"You picked her up immediately after leaving my bed and dropping me off here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you sleep with her?\" No longer was she trying to get away. Now she was leaning into him, nails clawing past his shirt and at his skin. \"No, wait. Don\u0027t tell me. I don\u0027t want to know. I just want you to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. I should leave. I should go on another date. Maybe with a Rakan this time. I\u0027ve never had one of those, you know. I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re the best, though, so I really should make an effort to —\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roar, she was on top of him, pinning him to the mattress, her fangs in his neck, cutting deep, his blood flowing into her mouth. There was a sting, then only warm pleasure. He could hear her swallowing, purring as the flavor met her tongue. Finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good girl. Take everything you need.\" Her lower body ground against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready he was hard as a rock, arching up to meet her thrusts. \"Just so you know, I didn\u0027t sleep with that agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mewling sound escaped her, and her teeth gentled on his neck. When she tried to disengage completely, he petted her hair with firm strokes, holding her in place. \"Nope. I\u0027m enjoying this. Because I was such a good boy on my date, you have to see to my needs. That means you don\u0027t get to stop yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn and on she continued to drink, her purrs growing louder, her body writhing faster ... faster, using him, taking what it needed, propelling her higher. Devyn gritted his teeth against the bliss, determined not to come like this again. A difficult task. She felt so good against him, she smelled like the sweetest flower, was finally doing something he\u0027d commanded her to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpots of color began to cloud his vision; she was taking a lot of blood, but still he didn\u0027t push her away. She needed it, and he had it to give. Even enjoyed the giving. \"More,\" he said, the word barely audible. \"Everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hoarse cry slipped from her as she wrenched her mouth away. Up and down her chest moved in quick succession, her hard nipples abrading his chest. Exquisite, he thought. A trickle of crimson slid down her chin. Her lips were red, dewy. Her eyes no longer glowed, but her skin was so rosy it was like the petal of a rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your stomach?\" he asked. Wow. He sounded halfway to the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I—it\u0027s fine.\" She blinked in astonishment. \"It\u0027s actually calm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was ... right then. Better than ... most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devyn?\" she said with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have the energy to form another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devyn,\" she repeated, determined this time. \"I\u0027m sorry, so sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to take so much. I didn\u0027t mean... I\u0027ll make it better. Okay? All right?\" Slowly she leaned down and kissed him. Drops of his own blood seeped into his mouth. No, not his, he thought then. Hers. She\u0027d swiped her tongue across her fangs, cutting the delicate tissue, and was feeding him that healing blood of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, damn, damn, was the next thought to hit him as some of his strength returned. He shoved her away from him and scrambled from the bed. He was panting, trembling, but he managed to maintain his balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devyn?\" she said uncertainly. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to take so much. You just tasted so good, and it had been so long ... I\u0027m really, really sorry, but I made it better. I did. You\u0027re already stronger. See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrubbed a hand down his face. She knows nothing about vampires, he reminded himself. She had no idea the magnitude of what she\u0027d just done. Or did she? His gaze intensified on her. She sat up, smoothing her hair from her face with a wobbly hand. She wore an expression of concern and remorse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she didn\u0027t know. Her ignorance didn\u0027t make it any better, though. He\u0027d come in here to check on her and give her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd okay, yeah. He\u0027d wanted to see and kiss her, but he hadn\u0027t come for this. Maybe he should have warned her never to do it. Maybe he should have— No. No! He wouldn\u0027t take the blame for this. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-23.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
