Can\u0027t handle Absolut?\" Evelyn asks and then contemplatively to Courtney, \"The California roll should circle the rim of the plate, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bateman. Drink?\" Price sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"J\u0026amp;B rocks,\" I tell him, suddenly thinking it\u0027s strange that Meredith wasn\u0027t invited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god. It\u0027s a mess,\" Evelyn gasps. \"I swear I\u0027m going to cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The sushi looks marvelous, \" I tell her soothingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh it\u0027s a mess,\" she wails. \"It\u0027s a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, the sushi looks marvelous,\" I tell her and in an attempt to be as consoling as possible I pick up a piece of the fluke and pop it in my mouth, groaning with inward pleasure, and hug Evelyn from behind; my mouth still full, I manage to say \"Delicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slaps at me in a playful way, obviously pleased with my reaction, and finally, carefully, airkisses my cheek and then turns back to Courtney. Price hands me a drink and walks toward the living room while trying to remove something invisible from his blazer. \"Evelyn, do you have a lint brush?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would rather have watched the baseball game or gone to the gym and worked out or tried that Salvadorian restaurant that got a couple of pretty good reviews, one in New York magazine, the other in the Times, than have dinner here but there is one good thing about dinner at Evelyn\u0027s: it\u0027s close to my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it okay if the soy sauce isn\u0027t exactly at room temperature?\" Courtney is asking. \"I think there\u0027s ice in one of the dishes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn is placing strips of pale orange ginger delicately in a pile next to a small porcelain dish filled with soy sauce. \"No, it\u0027s not okay. Now Patrick, could you be a dear and get the Kirin out of the refrigerator?\" Then, seemingly harassed by the ginger, she throws the clump down on the platter. \"Oh forget it. I\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move toward the refrigerator anyway. Staring darkly, Price reenters the kitchen and says, \"Who in the hell is in the living room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn feigns ignorance. \"Oh who is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney warns, \"Ev-el-yn. You did tell them, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" I ask, suddenly scared. \"Victor Powell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not Victor Powell, Patrick,\" Evelyn says casually. \"It\u0027s an artist friend of mine, Stash. And Vanden, his girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh so that was a girl in there,\" Price says. \"Go take a look, Bateman,\" he dares. \"Let me guess. The East Village?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Price,\" she says flirtatiously, opening beer bottles. \"Why no. Vanden goes to Camden and Stash lives in SoHo, so there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move out of the kitchen, past the dining room, where the table has been set, the beeswax candles from Zona lit in their sterling silver candleholders from Fortunoff, and into the living room. I can\u0027t tell what Stash is wearing since it\u0027s all black. Vanden has green streaks in her hair. She stares at a heavy-metal video playing on MTV while smoking a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahem,\" I cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanden looks over warily, probably drugged to the eyeballs. Stash doesn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi. Pat Bateman,\" I say, offering my hand, noticing my reflection in a mirror hung on the wall - and smiling at how good I look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes it; says nothing. Stash starts smelling his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmash cut and I\u0027m back in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just get her out of there.\" Price is seething. \"She\u0027s doped up watching MTV and I want to watch the goddamn MacNeil/Lehrer report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn is still opening large bottles of imported beer and absently mentions, \"We\u0027ve got to eat this stuff soon or else we\u0027re all going to be poisoned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got a green streak in her hair,\" I tell them. \"And she\u0027s smoking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bateman,\" Tim says, still glaring at Evelyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" I say. \"Timothy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a dufus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh leave Patrick alone,\" Evelyn says. \"He\u0027s the boy next door. That\u0027s Patrick. You\u0027re not a dufus, are you, honey?\" Evelyn is on Mars and I move toward the bar to make myself another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy next door.\" Tim smirks and nods, then reverses his expression and hostilely asks Evelyn again if she has a lint brush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn finishes opening the Japanese beer bottles and tells Courtney to fetch Stash and Vanden. \"We have to eat this now or else we\u0027re going to be poisoned,\" she murmurs, slowly moving her head, taking in the kitchen, making sure she hasn\u0027t forgotten anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can tear them away from the latest Megadeth video,\" Courtney says before exiting. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-4.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
