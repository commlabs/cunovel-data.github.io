I\u0027m under orders, just as you are. I can assure you, there is no use in your running. You\u0027re at the head of every intelligence agency\u0027s most wanted list. Half the governments of the world are looking for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe I\u0027m a traitor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCesar sighed. \"It doesn\u0027t matter what I believe, Robert. This is nothing personal. I have my orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To take me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can make it easier by turning yourself in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, paesano. If I need more advice, I\u0027ll call Dear Abby.\" He slammed down the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was aware that the longer he was at large, the greater the danger he was in. There would be security agents closing in on him from half a dozen countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has to be a tree, Robert thought. The line came from a legend about a hunter who was relating an experience he had on safari. \"This huge lion was racing toward me, and all my gun bearers had fled. I had no gun, and there was nowhere to hide. Not a bush or a tree in sight. And the beast was charging straight at me, coming closer and closer.\" \"How did you escape?\" a listener asked. \"I ran over to the nearest tree and climbed it.\" \"But you said there were no trees.\" \"You don\u0027t understand. There has to be a tree!\" And I have to find it, Robert thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around the piazza. It was almost deserted at this hour. He decided it was time to have a talk with the man who had started him on this nightmare, General Hilliard. But he would have to be careful. Modern electronic phone tracing was almost instantaneous. Robert observed that the two telephone booths next to the one he was in were both empty. Perfect. Ignoring the private number General Hilliard had given him, he dialled the switchboard of NSA. When an operator answered, Robert said, \"General Milliard\u0027s office, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, he heard a secretary\u0027s voice. \"General Hilliard\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert said, \"Please hold for an overseas call.\" He dropped the receiver and hurried into the next booth. He quickly redialled the number. A different secretary answered, \"General Hilliard\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please hold for an overseas call,\" Robert said. He let the receiver hang and walked into the third booth, and dialled. When another secretary answered, Robert said, \"This is Commander Bellamy. J want to speak to General Hilliard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gasp of surprise. \"Just a moment, Commander.\" The secretary buzzed the intercom. \"General, Commander Bellamy is on line three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Hilliard turned to Harrison Keller. \"Bellamy is on line three. Start a trace, fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrison Keller hurried over to a telephone on a side table, and dialled the Network Operations Centre, manned and monitored twenty-four hours a day. The senior officer on duty answered. \"NOC. Adams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will it take to do an emergency trace on an incoming call?\" Keller whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Between one and two minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start it. General Hilliard\u0027s office, line three. I\u0027ll hang on.\" He looked over at the General and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Hilliard picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander ... is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Operations Centre, Adams punched a number into a computer. \"Here we go,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was time you and I had a talk, General.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you called, Commander. Why don\u0027t you come in and we can discuss the situation? I\u0027ll arrange a plane for you, and you can be here in ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks. Too many accidents happen in airplanes, General.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the communications room, ESS, the electronic switching system, had been activated. The computer screen began lighting up. AX121-B ... AX122-C ... AX123-C ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Keller whispered into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Network Operations Centre in New Jersey is searching the Washington, DC trunks, sir. Hold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen went blank. Then the words: OVERSEAS TRUNK LINE ONE flashed onto the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The call is coming from somewhere in Europe. We\u0027re tracing the country ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Hilliard was saying, \"Commander Bellamy, I think there\u0027s been a misunderstanding. I have a suggestion ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert replaced the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Hilliard looked over at Keller. \"Did you get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrison Keller talked into the phone to Adams. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert moved into the second booth and picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Hilliard\u0027s secretary said, \"Commander Bellamy is calling on line two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men looked at each other. General Hilliard pressed the button for line two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me make a suggestion,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Hilliard put his hand over the mouthpiece. \"Get the trace working again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrison Keller picked up the telephone and said to Adams, \"He\u0027s on again. Line two. Move fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My suggestion, General, is that you call off all your men. And I mean now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you misunderstand the situation, Commander. We can work this problem out if ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you how we can work it out. There\u0027s a termination order out on me. I want you to cancel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Network Operations Centre, the computer screen was flashing a new message: AX155-C Subtrunk A21 verified. Circuit 301 to Rome. Atlantic Trunk 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got it,\" Adams said into the phone. \"We\u0027ve traced the trunk to Rome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me the number and location,\" Keller told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rome, Robert was glancing at his watch. \"You gave me an assignment. I carried it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did very well, Commander. Here is what I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe General turned to Keller. \"He hung up, again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller spoke into the phone. \"Did you get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too quick, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert moved into the next booth and picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenera:! Hilliard\u0027s secretary\u0027s voice came over the intercom. \"Commander Bellamy is on line one, General.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe General snapped, \"Find the bastard!\" He picked up the telephone. \"Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to listen, General, and listen closely. You\u0027ve murdered a lot of innocent people. If you don\u0027t call off your men, I\u0027m going to the media to tell them what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t advise you to do that, unless you want to start a worldwide panic. The aliens are real, and we\u0027re defenceless against them. They\u0027re getting ready to make their move. You have no idea what would happen if word of this leaked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither have you,\" Bellamy retorted. \"I\u0027m not giving you a choice. Call off the contract on me. If there\u0027s one more attempt made on my life, I\u0027m going public.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" General Hilliard said. \"You win. I\u0027ll call it off. Why don\u0027t we do this? We can ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your trace should be working pretty good, now,\" Robert said. \"Have a good day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get it?\" Keller barked into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdams said, \"Close, sir. He was calling from an area in Central Rome. He kept switching numbers on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe General looked over at Keller. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, General. All we know is that he\u0027s somewhere in Rome. Do you believe his threat? Are we going to call off the contract on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027re going to eliminate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert went over his options again. They were pitifully few. They would be watching the airports, railroad stations, bus terminals and car rental agencies. He could not check into a hotel because SIFAR would be circulating red notices. Yet he had to get out of Rome. He needed a cover. A companion. They would not be looking for a man and a woman together. It was a beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA taxi was standing at the corner. Robert mussed his hair, pulled down his tie, and staggered drunkenly toward the taxi. \"Hey, there,\" he called. \"You!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver looked at him, distastefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert pulled out a twenty-dollar bill and slapped it into the man\u0027s hand. \"Hey, buddy, I\u0027m lookin\u0027 a\u0027get laid. You know what tha\u0027 means? D\u0027you speak any goddamn English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver looked at the bill. \"You wish a woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it, pal. I wish a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andiamo,\" the driver said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert lurched into the cab, and it took off. He looked back. He was not being followed. The adrenalin was pumping. Half the governments in the world are looking for you. And there would be no appeal. Their orders were to assassinate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later they had reach Tor di Ounto, Rome\u0027s red light district, populated by whores and pimps. They drove down Pas-seggiata Archeologica, and the driver pulled to a stop at a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will find a woman here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, buddy.\" Robert paid the amount on the meter, and stumbled out of the taxi. It pulled away with a squeal of tyres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert looked around, studying his surroundings. No police. A few cars and a handful of pedestrians. There were more than a dozen whores cruising the street. In the spirit of \"let\u0027s round up the usual suspects\", the police had conducted their bi-monthly sweep to satisfy the voices of morality, and moved the city\u0027s prostitutes from the Via Veneto, with its high visibility, to this area where they would not offend the dowagers taking tea at Doney\u0027s. For that reason, most of the ladies were attractive and well dressed. There was one in particular who caught Robert\u0027s eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared to be in her early twenties. She had long, dark hair and was dressed in a tasteful black skirt and white blouse, covered by a camelhair coat. Robert guessed that she was a part-time actress or model. She was watching Robert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert staggered up to her. \"Hi, baby,\" he mumbled. \"D\u0027you speak English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Le\u0027s you an\u0027 me have a party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled uncertainly. Drunks could be trouble. \"Maybe you should go sober up first.\" She had a soft Italian accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m sober enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will cost you a hundred dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tha\u0027s okay, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her decision. \"Va bene. Come. There is a hotel just around the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. What\u0027s your name, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine\u0027s Henry.\" A police car appeared in the distance, headed their way. \"Let\u0027s get outta here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other women cast envious glances as Pier and her American customer walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel was no Hassler, but the pimply-faced boy at the desk downstairs did not ask for a passport. In fact, he barely glanced up as he handed Pier a key. \"Fifty thousand lire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier looked at Robert. He took the money from his pocket and gave it to the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room they entered contained a large bed in the corner, a small table, two wooden chairs and a mirror over the basin. There was a clothes rack behind the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must pay me in advance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Robert counted out one hundred dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grazie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier began to get undressed. Robert walked over to the window. He pushed aside a corner of the curtain and peered out. Everything appeared to be normal. He hoped that by now the police were following the red truck back to France. Robert dropped the curtain and turned around. Pier was naked. She had a surprisingly lovely body. Firm, young breasts, rounded hips, a small waist and long, shapely legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching Robert. \"Aren\u0027t you going to get undressed, Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the tricky part. \"... tell you the truth,\" Robert said, \"I think I had a little too much to drink. I can\u0027t give you any action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was regarding him with wary eyes. \"Then why did you ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I stay here and sleep it off, we can make love in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I have to work. It would cost me money to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll take care of that.\" He pulled out several hundred-dollar bills and handed them to her. \"Will that cover it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier looked at the money, making up her mind. It was tempting. It was cold outside, and business was slow. On the other hand, there was something strange about this man. First of all, he did not really seem to be drunk. He was nicely dressed and for this much money he could have checked them into a fine hotel. Well, Pier thought, what the hell? Questo cazzo se ne frega? \"All right. There\u0027s only this bed for the two of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier watched as Robert walked over to the window again and moved the edge of the curtain aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are looking for something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a back door out of the hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I getting myself into? Pier wondered. Her best friend had been murdered, hanging out with mobsters. Pier considered herself wise in the ways of men, but this one puzzled her. He did not seem like a criminal, but still ... \"Yes, there is,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden scream, and Robert whirled around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dio! Dio! Sono venuta tre volte!\" It was a woman\u0027s voice, coming from the next room through the paper-thin walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Robert\u0027s heart was pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier grinned. \"She\u0027s having fun. She said she just came for the third time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert heard the creaking of bed springs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to bed?\" Pier stood there naked, unembarrassed, watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Robert sat down on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to get undressed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself.\" Pier moved over to the bed and lay down beside Robert. \"I hope you don\u0027t snore,\" Pier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert had no intention of sleeping. He wanted to check the street during the night, to make sure they did not come to the hotel. They would get around to these small, third-class hotels eventually, but it would take them time. They had too many other places to cover first. He lay there, feeling bone-tired, and closed his eyes for a moment to rest. He slept. He was back home, in his own bed, and he felt Susan\u0027s warm body next to his. She\u0027s back, he thought, happily. She\u0027s come back to me. Baby, I\u0027ve missed you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRome, Italy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was awakened by the sun hitting his face. He sat up abruptly, looking around for an instant in alarm, disorientated. When he saw Pier, memory flooded back. He relaxed. Pier was at the mirror, brushing her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buon giorno,\" she said. \"You do not snore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert looked at his watch. Nine o\u0027clock. He had wasted precious hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to make love now? You have already paid for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier walked over to the bed, naked and provocative. \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t if I wanted to, lady. \"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Va bene.\" She began to dress. She asked casually, \"Who is Susan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question caught him off guard. \"Susan? What made you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talk in your sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered his dream. Susan had come back to him. Maybe it was a sign. \"She\u0027s a friend.\" She\u0027s my wife. She\u0027s going to get tired of Moneybags and return to me some day. If I\u0027m still alive, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert walked over to the window. He lifted the curtain and looked out. The street was crowded now with pedestrians and merchants opening up their shops. There were no signs of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to put his plan into motion. He turned to the girl. \"Pier, how would you like to go on a little trip with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him with suspicion. \"A trip ... where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go to Venice on business, and I hate travelling alone. Do you like Venice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll pay you for your time, and we\u0027ll have a little holiday together.\" He was staring out of the window again. \"I know a lovely hotel there. The Cipriani.\" Years ago, he and Susan had stayed at the Royal Danieli, but he had been back since, and it had become sadly run-down, and the beds were impossible. The only thing that remained of the hotel\u0027s former elegance was Luciano, at the reception desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will cost you a thousand dollars a day.\" She was ready to settle for five hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a deal.\" Robert said. He counted out two thousand dollars. \"We\u0027ll start with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier hesitated. She had a premonition that something was wrong. But the start of the movie she had been promised a bit part in had been delayed, and she needed the money. \"Very well,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, Pier watched him scan the street carefully before stepping out to hail a taxi. He\u0027s a target for somebody, Pier thought. I\u0027m getting out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Pier said, \"I\u0027m not sure I should go to Venice with you. I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have a great time,\" Robert told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly across the street he saw a jewellery store. He took Pier\u0027s hand. \"Come on. I\u0027m going to get you something pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her across the street to the jewellery store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk behind the counter said, \"Buon giorno, signore. Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Robert said. \"We\u0027re looking for something lovely for the lady.\" He turned to Pier. \"Do you like emeralds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert said to the clerk, \"Do you have an emerald bracelet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si, signore. I have a beautiful emerald bracelet.\" He walked over to a case and took out a bracelet. \"This is our finest. It is fifteen thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert looked at Pier. \"Do you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was speechless. She nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take it,\" Robert said. He handed the clerk his ONI credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, please.\" The clerk disappeared into the back room. When he returned, he said, \"Shall I wrap it for you, or ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. My friend will wear it.\" Robert put the bracelet on Pier\u0027s wrist. She was staring at it, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert said, \"That will look pretty in Venice, won\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier smiled up at him. \"Very.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were out on the street, Pier said, \"I ... I don\u0027t know how to thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want you to have a good time,\" Robert told her. \"Do you have a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I used to have an old one, but it was stolen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still have your driver\u0027s licence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching him, puzzled. \"Yes, but without a car, what good is a driver\u0027s licence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see. Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hailed a taxi. \"Via Po, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in the taxi, studying him. Why was he so anxious for her company? He had not even touched her. Could he be ...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Qui!\" Robert called to the driver. They were a hundred yards away from Maggiore\u0027s Car Rental Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re getting out here,\" Robert told Pier. He paid the driver and waited until the taxi was out of sight. He handed Pier a large bundle of bank notes. \"I want you to rent a car for us. Ask for a Fiat or an Alfa Romeo. Tell them we\u0027ll want it for four or five days. This money will cover the deposit. Rent it in your name. I\u0027ll wait for you in the bar across the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than eight blocks away, two detectives were questioning the hapless driver of a red truck with French licence plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vous me faites chier. I have no idea how the fuck that card got in the back of my truck,\" the driver screamed. \"Some crazy Italian probably put it in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two detectives looked at each other. One of them said, \"I\u0027ll phone it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cesar sat at his desk, thinking about the latest development. Earlier, the assignment had seemed so simple. \"You won\u0027t have any trouble finding him. When the time comes, we will activate the homing device, and it will lead you right to him.\" Someone had obviously underestimated Commander Bellamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Frank Johnson was seated in General Milliard\u0027s office, his huge frame filling the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have half the agents in Europe looking for him,\" General Milliard said. \"So far, they\u0027ve had no luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to take more than luck,\" Colonel Johnson said. \"Bellamy\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know he\u0027s in Rome. The sonofabitch just charged a bracelet for fifteen thousand dollars. We have him bottled up. There\u0027s no way he can get out of Italy. We know the name he\u0027s using on his passport - Arthur Butterfield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Johnson shook his head. \"If I know Bellamy, you haven\u0027t a clue about what name he\u0027s using. The only thing you can count on is that Bellamy won\u0027t do what you count on him to do. We\u0027re after a man who\u0027s as good as the best in the business. Maybe better. If there\u0027s any place to run, Bellamy will run there. If there\u0027s any place to hide, he\u0027ll hide there. I think our best bet is to bring him out in the open, smoke him out. Right now, he\u0027s controlling all the moves. We have to take the initiative away from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, go public? Give it to the press?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Milliard pursed his lips. \"That\u0027s going to be touchy. We can\u0027t afford to expose ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t have to. We\u0027ll put out a release that he\u0027s wanted on a drug-smuggling charge. That way we can get Interpol and all the police departments in Europe involved without tipping our hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Milliard thought about it for a moment. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027m leaving for Rome,\" Colonel Johnson said, \"I\u0027m going to take charge of the hunt myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Colonel Frank Johnson returned to his office, he was in a thoughtful mood. He was playing a dangerous game. There was no question about it. He had to find Commander Bellamy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-39.html","bookId":2363,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM"}
