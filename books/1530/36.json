It was cracked half open. Lamplight flowed into the hall. Painter listened intently. Silence. He steeled himself against what he would find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara called to him, knowing what he feared. “Safia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:02 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO MAHA SHOVED out an arm as the ship rolled beneath him. The darkness of the bilge threw off his sense of balance. Water sloshed over his shoes, chilling his ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crash sounded behind him…and a curse. Danny was faring no better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know where you’re going?” Coral asked Omaha, her voice frosty, echoing a bit in the dank bilge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he snapped back. It was a lie. He kept trailing one hand along the sloped wall to the left, praying he’d find a ladder leading back up. The next one should lead to the main storage hold under the middeck. Or so he hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRats squeaked in sharp protest, sounding larger in the darkness, as big as wet bulldogs. Their numbers multiplied in the imagination. Omaha heard their bodies splashing through the bilge waters, running ahead of them, likely piling into an angry mass at the stern of the ship. In an alley in Calcutta, he had seen a rat-gnawed corpse. The eyes gone, the genitals eaten away, all soft places gnashed. He did not like rats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut fear for Safia drove him onward, his anxiety heightened by the darkness, the spates of gunfire. Bloody images flashed across his mind’s eye, too terrible to dwell upon. Why had he put off telling her how he still felt about her? He would gladly drop on his knees now to have her safe and sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis outstretched hand struck something solid. He reached out and discovered rungs and nail heads. A ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here it is,” he said with more confidence than he felt. He didn’t care if he was right or wrong or where the hell the ladder led. He was climbing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Danny and Coral moved closer, he mounted the rungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful,” Coral warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gunfire continued above. Close. That was warning enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the topmost rung, he searched until he found the inner handle to the hatch. Praying it wasn’t locked or weighted down with cargo, he shoved up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hatch flew open with ease, swinging back and crashing against a wooden support pillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral hissed at him. No words, just protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlessed light flowed over him, blindingly bright after the gloom below. The smell was also refreshing after the salt and mold of the ship’s bilge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh-cut hay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large shadow shifted to his right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and found himself facing a huge horse, looming over him. The same Arabian stallion that had broken free earlier. It threw its head and huffed at him. Eyes white with terror, it raised a hoof in threat, ready to stamp out the sudden intruder into its shipboard stables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha ducked back, cursing their luck. The bilge hatch had opened into the stallion’s stall. He spotted other horses in neighboring stanchions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention to the stallion. The horse tugged at the lead tethering him in place. The spooked Arabian was better than any armed guard. But they had to get out and reach the crated weapons in the neighboring hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear for Safia fired his blood. He had come this far…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrusting the ropes held the horse, he dove out of the hatch, rolled flat across the planks, and passed under the fence that closed off the stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaining his feet, he dusted off his bare knees. “Move quick!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found a horse blanket, brightly colored in reds and yellows. He waved it at the stallion, keeping it distracted so the others could climb to safety. The horse whinnied at his motions, but rather than growing more perturbed at the additional intruders, the stallion pulled at the ropes that secured it, drawn to the saddle blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha realized it must recognize its own blanket, a promising sign that someone was about to take it for a ride, to let it out of the stalls. Alarm heightened the stallion’s desire to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regret, he lowered the blanket back over the fence once Danny and Coral reached his side. The stallion’s large eyes met his, scared, full of the need for reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are the guns?” Coral asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha turned from the stall. “Should be over there.” He pointed past the ramp that led to the upper deck. A stack of crates, three high, stood along the back wall. A Kensington crest marked each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Omaha led them across the hold, he kept his head low with each new burst of gunfire. A repeated exchange of gunfire, a volley back and forth. The deadly match sounded like it was coming from outside the double doors at the top of the ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered Danny’s earlier question. Who was attacking? This was no mere band of pirates. This was too sustained, too organized, too damn bold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the crates, he searched the stapled manifests. Having organized the supplies himself, he knew there should be a crate of rifles and handguns. He found the right box. Using a crowbar, he broke it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny took out one of the rifles. “What are we going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to stay low,” Omaha said, grabbing a Desert Eagle pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?” Danny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha cocked an ear to the fighting as he loaded the pistol on the floor. “I have to get to the others. Make sure they’re safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in truth, he pictured only Safia, smiling, younger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had failed her before—not again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral finally rose from her own search of the crate’s contents with a single pistol. She quickly and efficiently loaded its magazine with .357 rounds, then slammed it home. Armed now, she seemed more relaxed, a lioness loosened up and ready for the hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his eyes. “We should return forward through the bilge. Join the others from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore gunfire spat just outside the double doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’d lose too much time.” Omaha glanced to the ramp that led directly to the heart of the gunfire. “There may be another way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral frowned at him as he outlined his plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to be kidding,” Danny muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Coral nodded as Omaha finished. “It’s worth a shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then let’s go,” he said. “Before we’re too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10 Storm Surge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDECEMBER 3, 2:07 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARABIAN SEA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT HEY WERE too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter approached the open door to Safia’s cabin. A lamp glowed from within. Despite the urgency, the certain knowledge that the ship had been mined, he hesitated a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Kara remained with Clay Bishop’s body. Painter feared finding Safia in the same condition. Dead on the floor. But knew he had to face the truth. She had trusted him. The deaths were all his fault. He’d not been vigilant enough. The mission had taken place under his nose, on his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding to the side, he pushed the door wider. Unblinking, he searched the cabin. Empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisbelieving, he stepped cautiously over the threshold. A scent of jasmine lingered in the room. But that was all that was left of the woman who had once occupied it. There was no sign of violence. Yet the metal suitcase that housed the museum artifact was nowhere in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, momentarily paralyzed between concern and confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moan sounded behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clay’s still alive!” Kara called from the passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stumbled back into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara knelt over the young man’s body. She held something pinched between her fingers. “I found this in his back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he crossed to her, Painter noted the boy’s chest moving shallowly up and down. How had he missed that? But he knew the answer. He had been too rushed, too certain of their doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara offered what she held. A small bloody dart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tranquilizer,” he confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back toward the open doorway. Tranquilizers. So they had wanted Safia alive. This was all a kidnapping. He shook his head, biting back a laugh—half in appreciation for Cassandra’s cleverness, half in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia was still alive. For now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t leave him,” Kara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, picturing the glow of the submersible in the dark waters, waking again to the urgency. How much time did they have? “Stay with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t explain. He rushed down to the lower deck and searched the rooms for the other members of the party: the Dunn brothers and his partner. Like Safia’s room, their cabins were empty. Were they all taken?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow he discovered a cowering crewman, one of the galley workers, with a bloody nose. He tried to encourage the man to follow him back up, but fright kept the fellow paralyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter did not have time to persuade him and pounded back up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara had managed to get the student to sit up. He was groggy, head lolling. Unintelligible words mumbled from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon.” Painter scooped Clay under one arm, drawing him to his feet. It was like maneuvering a wet sack of cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara collected his eyeglasses from the floor. “Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to get off this ship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re all gone. Safia and the others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter led the way up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached the last landing, a figure swept down toward them. He spoke rapidly in Arabic, too fast for Painter to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain al-Haffi,” Kara said quickly in introduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had intel on the man. He was the leader of the Desert Phantoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need more ammunition from the stockpiles in the hold,” the captain said rapidly. “You must all go into hiding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter blocked him. “How long can you last with what you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrug. “Minutes only.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must keep them pinned down. They mustn’t leave the ship.” Painter thought quickly. He imagined the only reason the Shabab Oman hadn’t been blasted apart already was that the demolition team was still on board. Once they were gone, nothing would stop Cassandra from detonating the mines. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-36.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
