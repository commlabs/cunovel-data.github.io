I\u0027m not going to do anything you wouldn\u0027t do at my age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands up and says, \"That\u0027s it. You\u0027re canceling this date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsnat walks out of the room and comes back with her mom. Doda Yucky says something to Dad in Hebrew. He sits back down, obviously defeated, and then Doda Yucky leads me out to the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi takes one look at me, smiles, and his hand goes to his heart. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he takes my hand, squeezes it, and leads me to his car. Osnat and O\u0027dead are already waiting in the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The disco,\" he answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disco place? I don\u0027t really have visions of spending my last night in Israel in a loud, crowded, smoky bar. But I keep my opinions to myself. He\u0027s trying, even if my heart is a little deflated at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reach the place, I notice the line is longer than the last time we were here. Great, now I\u0027m going to spend the better part of this evening in a line. What a bummer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi drives up to the front of the club. Osnat and O\u0027dead get out, and I open my car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, to wait in line like the rest of the people who want to go in,\" I say sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking you somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI furrow my eyebrows. \"You said we were going to \u0027the disco.\u0027 I specifically heard you say the word \u0027disco\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, \"We are. But only to drop Osnat and O\u0027dead off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Avi winks at me, I settle back in the car and close the door. I really do have butterflies in my stomach, because now I\u0027m alone with him. I\u0027ve never felt like this about anyone else in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds my hand as we drive away from the club and head up a winding dirt road that probably hasn\u0027t been traveled in centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops the car, turns to me, and shows me a handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is my nose running?\" I ask. I mean, is that a hint or what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s to blindfold you, Amy. Close your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close them, lean into him and feel him tie the blindfold around my head while he brushes a gentle kiss across my lips. After he helps me out of the car, he leads me somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is exciting, he\u0027s exciting. I can\u0027t wait for all the surprises he\u0027s planned for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes the blindfold off. \"Open your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink a few times before I can focus in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandles. Lots of them. Two pillows. And between the pillows is an empty plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow his instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, wait here.\" He sounds nervous, which is so cute. Usually he\u0027s so calm and cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take in my surroundings. We\u0027re in the middle of nowhere, on some barren, deserted land with crickets serenading us. I sit down on one of the pillows and wait. Avi comes back with a Styrofoam carton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates before opening it. \"Are you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his eyebrows raises. \"You tell me. I have food here but if you\u0027re hungry for something else--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Food\u0027s great,\" I say, interrupting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me one of his awesome smiles, sits down next to me, and opens the carton. When I see what\u0027s in there, I get so choked up I have to swallow a lump in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bought me sushi! My very favorite food in the whole world. How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sushi rolls are like little, round happy faces smiling at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hands me a set of chopsticks. \"Ron told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been going through sushi withdrawal these past few months,\" I explain. \"Do you know what quitting cold turkey like that will do to a person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s looking at me like I\u0027m nuts. But I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want some?\" I ask, my mouth already full with a spicy tuna roll. I\u0027m moaning in pleasure as I eat the sweet, tangy roll, the sound coming from my throat automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi admits he\u0027s never eaten sushi, so I coach him. We share the meal, Avi tentatively trying small bites while I\u0027m shoving the stuff very unlady-like into my mouth. I\u0027ll have to remember to tell Jessica Israelis make great sushi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finish the meal, Avi stands up. \"I have another surprise for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I ask, totally excited. So far this evening is absolutely perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot, I forgot something.\" He goes off and comes back with a small bouquet of flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I\u0027m not trying to be bitchy here. But Safta got a whole flower shop from my grandfather. And what does Avi expect me to do with flowers when I\u0027m going on a twelve-hour flight tomorrow? I try not to show my disappointment as he places them in front of me, so I smile as sweetly as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like the flowers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a red rose out of the bouquet and breaks off part of the stem. Then he kneels next to me and places the rose in my hair. \"I wanted to get you something to remember me by, but I didn\u0027t know what you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you got me flowers. That\u0027s nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles. \"The flowers were from my mom. She\u0027s old-fashioned. To be honest, she bought them for me to give to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the romantic guy I thought he was. \"The sushi was great,\" I say. \"But you\u0027re losing brownie points fast, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here,\" he says. \"I have one last surprise.\" When he comes back and I see what he\u0027s holding, I can\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi is holding Mutt. The puppy has a blue ribbon around his neck. And he\u0027s beautiful. \"You washed him,\" I say, tears streaming down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s officially yours now,\" he says, and places Mutt in my lap. \"I\u0027ve arranged for you to take him back to the States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe how fluffy and soft he is now that he\u0027s clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I really take him home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. He\u0027ll probably have to go through a quarantine period, but--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smother his words with my lips, because this is the most perfect night of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spend the rest of the evening talking, making out, fooling around, and playing with Mutt. Right before we pack up the pillows and candles, I know we have to have The Talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ... I guess our summer fling is over,\" I blurt out, fingering his bracelet still on my wrist. I undo the clasp and hold it out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi leans forward, resting his elbows on his bent knees. \"Keep it. So you won\u0027t forget me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if. \"I\u0027ll never forget you. And I realize I am a spoiled American bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, I\u0027m sorry I ever said that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say. \"I\u0027m spoiled because I want us to keep in touch and maybe one day, after you finish the army, we could, you know, get together again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long way off,\" he says. \"What if you\u0027re dating some-one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you are?\" I counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve taught me so much about myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smoothes the stray hair in my face and tucks it behind my ear, his fingertips lingering on my earlobe. When his fingers trail down to the Jewish star still around my neck he says, \"You really are a gift from God, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he leans down to kiss me for the last time, I know for a fact somewhere, sometime, someplace, I\u0027ll be kissing Avi again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd next time, it might just be on the top of Mount Masada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end of one thing is just the beginning of another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m back home in Chicago. Yep, Dad and I actually made the long plane ride back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was kind of nervous to tell Mitch about Avi, but when Jessica spilled the beans and told me she and Mitch kind of got together after their Ravinia night, I felt a lot better. Of course I made them both sweat it out for a couple of hours. Then I spilled my own beans and told them about Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Israeli non-boyfriend is in the army now, training to be a kickass commando. He writes when he can, which is about once a week. I realize from his letters O\u0027dead\u0027s name is spelled Oded and Moron is actually spelled Moran (thank goodness for them). Doo-Doo still goes by his nickname, but I hope to change that next summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi never told me he loved me, but he doesn\u0027t have to say it. I know he\u0027s worried about me worrying about him and he loves me. He has a hard time saying it out loud. I\u0027m okay with that, for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad and I are going to spend my summer break in Israel next year. This time, I\u0027m planning a two-week-long camping trip throughout the country. I can teach Dad a few things this time, like when to duck when an alpaca starts to make gurgling noises. Avi will be able to take two weeks off then; I can\u0027t wait to see him. Safta is doing okay--she starts her next set of chemo treatments next month. I\u0027m sending her a care package today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding between my mom and Marc with a \"c\" was okay. Marc and I had a talk before the wedding. I told him he could be a friend to me, but I already have a father. He took the news better than I expected. Ron was at the wedding; he was a great dance partner for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been living at my dad\u0027s apartment until Marc and Mom\u0027s new house in the \u0027burbs (which they decided to build from scratch) is ready, which will be months from now. While I\u0027m here, I have a lot of work to do ...like teaching Ron how to dress to impress a woman. He\u0027s not there yet, but he\u0027s on his way to becoming a retired bachelor. All I have to do is find the right woman for him. In the meantime, he\u0027s teaching me Hebrew and swears to his friends I\u0027m a natural when it comes to herding sheep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe and my religion? Well, I\u0027m taking conversion classes with Rabbi Glassman over at Bait Chaverim (which for you non-Hebrew speakers means House of Friends). Mom was shocked when I told her I\u0027m becoming Jewish. I\u0027ve made her promise to make sure there are no pork or shellfish products in the food she makes for me. Keeping kosher is part of who I am now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, that\u0027s Mutt. And yes, my dog has a speech impediment. I can\u0027t help but love the little bugger. He eats most of Mom\u0027s shoes, but knows to leave mine alone. He also thinks he\u0027s a lap dog although he\u0027s going to be about ninety pounds when he\u0027s full grown. We\u0027ve been through a lot together and he\u0027s teaching me to love animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Amy Nelson Barak and I went to Israel for my summer vacation. I learned about my family, my heritage, a beautiful land full of rich history, and love. Wouldn\u0027t you know, my ruined summer vacation turned out to be the best three months of my life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-25.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
