Knew I had to get out of there, so I ran back to my room to pack my things and get out. Then I realized I could just hide the body in the tunnel—no one would ever know. I went back down to the torture chamber but I was too late. The light was on and I knew someone had found her. Verity was in there. I saw her when I dumped Maggie\u0027s body in the tunnel. She must have run in there to hide when she heard me coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas froze. He swung around, his eyes threatening violence. \" What have you done with Verity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer peered at him, blinking rain out of his eyes. An insane intelligence blazed in his eyes. He grinned slowly. \"I left her in the tunnel with the old bitch, naturally. You don\u0027t know about the tunnel, do you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Hazelhurst\u0027s big secret. Verity\u0027s in there now and you\u0027ll never find her. No one will ever find any of them. But that\u0027s the best way, you see. There\u0027s no proof. As long as all of them are buried in that tunnel, there\u0027s no proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hurt Verity or just leave her in the tunnel?\" Jonas\u0027s hands tightened around Spencer\u0027s neck. His fury and despair made him oblivious to everything except finding the truth in Spencer\u0027s mad eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me, you crazy bastard. What did you do to Verity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never find her or Frampton\u0027s body. Just like no one ever found Hazelhurst. I\u0027ll bet Verity thought she was hiding from me when she ran in there. She thought she\u0027d be safe in that tunnel. But now she\u0027s locked in there forever. No proof. No proof.\" Spencer started to giggle. Then he looked frightened. \"My pills. It\u0027s time for my pills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t get your pills until you tell me if you hurt Verity.\" Jonas tried to keep his voice calm; tried to remind himself that he was dealing with a certifiable lunatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked mildly surprised. \"I didn\u0027t hurt her. I didn\u0027t have to. I told you, she can\u0027t get out. Stupid woman ran right into the tunnel. She\u0027ll never find her way out. It took Hazelhurst months to learn how to operate the tunnel doors. Even if she finds the lock, it won\u0027t work. I jammed the mechanism on the outside. The only witness, you see. She\u0027s the only witness, the only one who saw me put Maggie\u0027s body into the tunnel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas thought of Verity lost in the endless darkness of the hidden corridor. If she couldn\u0027t get out through the torture-chamber door, she would have to find her way back to the bedroom entrance. And he\u0027d never explained to her how to operate the door mechanism. She would be shivering in abject terror there in the endless blackness of the tunnel, searching for the secret to unlocking the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas looked deep into Slade Spencer\u0027s insane eyes. He wasn\u0027t going to learn anything else from this bastard. He slammed his fist into Spencer\u0027s jaw, and the man dropped to the ground without so much as a gasp. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas left Spencer lying in the mud and ran for the villa. The wind howled through the trees. Branches snapped at him and the rain was a sheet of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe burst through the front door of the silent villa and took the stairs to the second floor in great, hungry strides. Then he was racing down the hall to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas pounded into the bedroom. The tunnel door was closed. He struggled furiously with the mechanism behind the tapestry and watched the stone door swing ponderously inward. It seemed to take forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick glance through the widening crack showed no sign of Verity. Either she had not been able to find her way back to the bedroom, or she was still trying desperately to open the door at the other end of the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stepped through the opening as soon as there was room. He shone the flashlight quickly to the right. Verity wasn\u0027t anywhere in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rattle of bones and a scraping sound from behind the tunnel door made him whip around in a dangerous crouch. The flashlight beam illuminated the face of his beloved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity emerged from behind the door with a stark, savagely determined expression. Her eyes were strangely unfocused. Her arms were raised above her head, her hands clutched around the hilt of the stiletto that had been buried in Digby Hazelhurst. Digby\u0027s bones rattled at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stepped hastily out of reach and held up both hands. \"Easy, honey. I\u0027m a reasonable man. You want to delay the wedding a couple of weeks while you buy a fancy dress? We\u0027ll delay the wedding, no problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Jonas!\" Verity dropped the stiletto. It clattered on the stones as she flung herself against his chest. \"It\u0027s about time you got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always nice to feel appreciated.\" Jonas wrapped his arms around her and held her so tightly he was afraid she would break. But all she did was give a small squeak. \"Jesus, honey, I was scared. But I should have known I wouldn\u0027t find you huddled shivering in terror. Did anyone ever tell you that you do a nice impression of Lady Macbeth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were scared! You want to compare notes? I\u0027ve never been so frightened in my life. And I couldn\u0027t see who was coming into the tunnel a minute ago. It\u0027s so dark in here that I was blinded when you opened the door. I thought it might be Slade.\" Verity lifted her head, her eyes wide. She was blinking rapidly. \"Jonas, Spencer\u0027s nearly killed Maggie. She\u0027s at the other end of the tunnel, unconscious and bleeding. We\u0027ve got to get her out. Then we\u0027ve got to do something about Slade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already taken care of Spencer. I found him making a try for the boat. He panicked, thinking he\u0027d killed Maggie and sealed both of you in the runnel. I gather he lost what was left of his nerve at that point and decided it was time to vacate the premises. I don\u0027t know how far he thought he was going to get in this storm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where is he? What did you do with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s tied up outside. Come on, let\u0027s get out of here. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve had enough of this tunnel to last you a lifetime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to get Maggie out. We can\u0027t just leave her there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of it,\" Jonas said gently. He urged Verity out into the bedroom. She was shaky but in control of herself. That was the thing about tyrants, he told himself with pride. They were tough. Then he saw her looking down at something she had just pulled out of her pocket. \"What have you got there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWordlessly she opened her palm and displayed an egg-shaped piece of green crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas took a step closer, awed by the realization of what she had found. \"Where the hell did you get that?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Maggie\u0027s. She had it on that chain she always wore around her neck. Digby must have given it to her. I found it when I checked her throat for a pulse. I must have grabbed it when I heard Spencer returning. Funny, I didn\u0027t even realize… \" She looked up at him, her aquamarine eyes questioning. \"It\u0027s the right one, Jonas. It\u0027s the crystal you\u0027ve been looking for, the one you think will unlock the vision.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-70.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
