Naturally, my brother-in-law felt obliged to give me a list of dos and don\u0027ts. This dinner was a much bigger deal than our first date. Tonight I\u0027d been invited to Leanne\u0027s home and she was cooking for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Ritchie--when did he become so knowledgeable about dating etiquette?--this was a significant gesture on Leanne\u0027s part. In his view, making me dinner was a clear sign that she was willing to move forward with the relationship. I wasn\u0027t sure, despite Ritchie\u0027s insistence that I take her invitation seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured us each a glass of Drappier and we sat down in her small living room. She had appetizer plates out with olives and roasted red peppers and two kinds of cheese. I leaned forward and speared an olive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you\u0027re wondering why I didn\u0027t arrange this dinner for the weekend,\" she said, \"since that\u0027s when I originally invited you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t given it much thought; I\u0027d surmised that she had other plans. Monday worked fine for me--regardless of Macy\u0027s assumptions. Like I said earlier, I didn\u0027t have what you\u0027d call a busy social calendar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother-in-law phoned to tell me they were planning to visit Mark this weekend and that she\u0027d get in touch with me while she was in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know if that required a response or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne stared down at her champagne. \"I...I didn\u0027t want her to call--or worse, drop by--in the middle of our dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" It would\u0027ve been awkward for us both. \"Did she contact you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne nodded. \"She phoned me early Sunday evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust about the time we would\u0027ve been sitting down to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muriel was terribly upset. Apparently, Mark\u0027s accepted a job that\u0027ll take him to Afghanistan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He joined the military?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is a company the army\u0027s contracted with. Mark was rather vague on the details. All he\u0027d tell his family is that the money will enable him to pay back what he...took and help with the fines. His sister tries to contribute, but she\u0027s having financial troubles of her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the worry etched on her face. It was more than obvious that she still had feelings for her ex-husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t want his mother to tell anyone, especially his sister and me, but she refused to make that promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very concerned, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her head, and I noticed the way her hand tightened around the stem of her glass. \"Yes. Muriel doesn\u0027t really know what Mark will be doing there, but we both suspect it doesn\u0027t have anything to do with accounting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" I said, hoping I sounded sympathetic. Discussing her ex-husband was uncomfortable, but I wasn\u0027t opposed to it. If she brought up the subject of Mark, then I could introduce Hannah into the conversation, too. That degree of honesty would probably be good for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oven timer went off and Leanne leaped to her feet as if she welcomed the intrusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood, too. \"Do you need any help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but thanks.\" She was away for a short while. When she returned, she reached for her glass and sat back down. \"The lasagna will have to wait for a few minutes. We\u0027re also having a salad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Hannah used to love cooking, too,\" I said, and remembered the wonderful meals my wife had put together. She always felt it was important for me to follow a regular eating schedule, even during my residency, when the hours were crazy and days melded into one another until time lost all meaning. Often I had no idea what day of the week it was. Hannah brought meals to me at the hospital and cooked for the other residents, too. Everyone loved her. How could they not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This recipe is one I got from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Hannah,\" I breathed, abruptly drawn away from my musings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were talking about our favorite dishes and she told me about this one. The next day, she handed me the recipe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was touched that Leanne had made it for me. At an earlier stage of my grief I might have found that presumptuous--or distressing. Now it warmed me with memories of Hannah and with gratitude toward Leanne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I ate another olive, Leanne set the salad bowl on the table. I rejoined her in the kitchen and we sat down at the small dinette table together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d gone to considerable effort to make this meal as pleasant as possible. The salad, which included several leafy greens, was full of green peppers, red onions and radishes, plus pine nuts and goat cheese. The poppy-seed dressing tasted homemade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another of Hannah\u0027s recipes?\" I asked as I poured a small amount over the salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne shook her head. \"This one comes from my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked some dressing off the end of my finger. \"It\u0027s delicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once we seemed to run out of things to say. Potential topics raced through my mind. If I was more interested in baseball, I could\u0027ve discussed the Mariners, who\u0027d played on both Saturday and Sunday. I couldn\u0027t recall who\u0027d won either game, although Ritchie had gone on about it for several minutes that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like baseball?\" I asked, a bit desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up as if the question had startled her. \"No, sorry. Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\" We both fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most women seem to enjoy cooking,\" I said, trying again. \"Hannah\u0027s cousin--\" I stopped abruptly, realizing I\u0027d sounded like an idiot. It wasn\u0027t a good idea to mention that Winter had made me dinner the week before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid, stupid, stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Ritchie\u0027s cardinal rules of dating was not to talk about other women. It wasn\u0027t as though I considered Winter a real date, though. I was glad I hadn\u0027t said anything about her cooking for me to my brother-in-law. The less he knew the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne seemed to be all out of conversation, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like more champagne?\" I asked, eager for something to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both stood at the same time. She opened the refrigerator and retrieved the champagne bottle and I refilled our glasses. While she was up, Leanne brought the casserole dish to the table, along with a loaf of warm, crisp bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat down again, and the silence seemed to yawn between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things at the clinic?\" she finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having a mural painted,\" I said. It was the first thought that came to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost blurted out that the woman doing it was someone on Hannah\u0027s list. But that would\u0027ve been even stupider than talking about Winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s painting it?\" Leanne asked. She seemed genuinely interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name\u0027s Macy Roth. She\u0027s done several murals for businesses in the area.\" I described the jungle scene, with its baby animals and multicolored parrots. \"Macy\u0027s quite a character. She doesn\u0027t have a normal nine-to-five job, which is no doubt for the best because she\u0027d drive any employer insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you want me to start?\" I leaned back in my chair and realized I was smiling. \"To begin with, she\u0027s constantly late.\" Now, that was a bit unfair. Macy had been late for our first meeting, but she\u0027d made a point of letting me know she\u0027d been on time ever since, as if this was some impressive achievement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems to have a houseful of cats and dogs,\" I elaborated, \"and she gives them ridiculous names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puffball--I think. And Sammy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not outlandish at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not, but she refers to them as though they\u0027re human. I thought Sammy was her neighbor, only her neighbor is Harvey, who\u0027s in his eighties and going through his second childhood. That\u0027s in his own words, apparently.\" In my opinion, the two of them, Macy and Harvey, would be perfect together because Macy acted like a kid, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess she\u0027s an eccentric artist type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eccentric fits her to a tee.\" Or, as my father would say, her elevator doesn\u0027t go all the way to the top. He has dozens of expressions like that, and I smiled, remembering his sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She sounds like a lot of fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why Hannah had put Macy on her list. My loving, patient wife had viewed Macy as fun. I, on the other hand, saw her as a screwball. A flake. I didn\u0027t typically know people like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long is it going to take her to finish the mural?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"A couple of weeks, or so she claims.\" I paused. \"Did I mention that she hums while she works?\" In all honesty, her humming wasn\u0027t nearly as irritating as I\u0027d implied. Besides, Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals. I\u0027d recognized \"Master of the House\" immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne seemed to find that amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show tunes,\" I went on. \"She says she\u0027s not aware of doing it, which is laughable. Then, before I can stop myself, I\u0027m humming, too, and I have no musical ability whatsoever. Plus I have to listen to my staff joining in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew someone like Macy once. A nurse. Her name was Gayle and she was always singing. She\u0027d also jump from one subject to the next without even the hint of a transition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That goes for Macy, too.\" The woman lived in her own world and anyone from planet Earth had to wonder what she was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned closer to the table and offered Leanne my plate as she sliced the lasagna into squares. I waited until she\u0027d served herself before I dug in. To say it was good would be an understatement of criminal proportions. I remembered eating this same meal with Hannah, and deeply appreciated Leanne\u0027s thoughtfulness in preparing it for me. I savored the second bite and the third. I devoured the lasagna and accepted another helping, which is something I rarely do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne talked about her friend Gayle, and I matched her stories, but mine were about my trials with Macy. Soon we were both relaxed and smiling at each other across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to go to a movie this weekend?\" I found myself asking as we lingered over coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Anything in particular you\u0027d like to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even know what was playing. \"You decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Action, comedy, drama? Do you have a preference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buttered popcorn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Action, then. Something along the lines of The Bourne Identity.\" That was the last movie I\u0027d seen, other than The African Queen with Winter the week before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie\u0027s Rule #17: Don\u0027t mention seeing a movie with Winter Adams while you\u0027re with Leanne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suggested we have our coffee in the living room and because our conversation about quirky individuals seemed to have run its course, she turned on the television. We watched a news show and when it was over, I carried my empty mug into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for dinner,\" I said and I hoped the simple words conveyed my very real gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t disappointed that I didn\u0027t bake crispy pork chops?\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe next time,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love that,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter had promised to make me a pork roast soon; I just hoped I didn\u0027t get confused about who\u0027d made what. Between the two, Winter and Leanne, I could find myself in trouble. Ritchie\u0027s Rule #23: Keep track of meals and movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to give me a call before Saturday?\" she asked as she held open the apartment door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-27.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
