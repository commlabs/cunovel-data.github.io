Hold out your hand, like this.” She stretched out her empty hand, palm up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot her a look, but did as she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, close your eyes and take a moment to center yourself. Listen to your heartbeat. Control your breathing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. My heart was still galloping from anger and the shock of the athame’s reaction, but as I moved inside myself, focusing, it slowed to a strong, steady beat. My breaths lengthened as I pulled in calming energy on the inhale and sent out pent-up emotion on the exhale. I repeated those breaths, over and over. Gradually, my emotions smoothed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open your eyes, child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. The athame balanced on my palm, just as Mab had held it a minute ago. It seemed weightless, although it vibrated slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay centered,” Mab said. “Don’t think about what I’m doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s like saying, ‘Don’t think about an elephant.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind. Give me a second.” Eyes shut, I found my center again. I stayed there for five heartbeats, then opened my eyes and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab put her right hand beneath mine. Adjusting the dagger with her left, she gently closed my fingers around the grip. Sparks flicked against my hand, and a buzzing sensation ran from my demon mark up my arm. Hellforged twitched, but it didn’t launch into orbit. I focused on my breathing, and the athame settled down. Mab gave my fingers a slight squeeze, then took her hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she did, Hellforged bucked like a rodeo bronco. But instead of clamping down, trying to control it, I worked at keeping a double focus—staying centered while inspecting the tool in my hand. It was a gorgeous dagger, lightweight and well made. Silver light shimmered along the glassy obsidian blade, flickering with the athame’s vibration. Gradually, the vibration changed to a pulse, one that matched my own heartbeat. When I felt that, I went from holding the athame to moving it, getting a sense of its balance—perfect—and feel. I wasn’t about to start spinning it, but Hellforged and I were getting to know each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Mab’s voice startled me, and the athame rocketed from my hand. It landed point first in the lawn ten feet away, where it stood upright, quivering. “What have you learned so far?” she asked, pulling Hellforged from the grass and wiping its blade with a handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That it likes you better than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab’s “We are not amused” face frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay. If I stay centered, the athame aligns with me and I can move it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Using this tool requires more focus than you’re accustomed to using. If you let go of that focus—even for a moment, as you just did—you lose control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting takes plenty of concentration. Going after Drudes or Harpies wasn’t exactly shooting monkeys in a barrel, or however that expression goes. But Mab was right. Keeping the double focus, plus doing whatever I’d have to do to fight the Morfran, would be tough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next hour, I practiced staying centered while holding and maneuvering Hellforged, getting the feel of it. I moved in superslow motion, as if I were practicing slowed-down tai chi. The athame was jumpy at first, ready to fly out of my hand as soon as my concentration flagged. But with practice, my focus improved. At the end of the hour, the dagger almost felt like a normal one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab checked her watch. “That’s enough for now. You’ll need to do an hour’s practice like that every day.” She put out her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” I said, returning the athame. Hellforged and I definitely needed more bonding time, but I was glad to quit for now. Maintaining that level of concentration was tiring. Even though I’d moved slowly, I’d been tense the whole time, and I ached worse than before. Ready for a nap, I started across the lawn to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going, young lady?” Mab’s voice halted me in my tracks. “We’ve more work to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I thought … You said …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said you were done practicing with Hellforged for today. I didn’t say we were finished.” I walked back to where Mab stood on the lawn. “I’m going to show you how to contain the Morfran,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time to stone the crows?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Precisely.” She gestured at the piece of slate she’d leaned against the tree trunk. “That tile is made of good Welsh slate, mined not far from here. As I mentioned before, slate is binding to the Morfran. The tricky part, of course, is to get the Morfran into the slate. Once it’s there, it can’t escape unless it’s released.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Pryce knows how to release it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe he does, yes. Years ago, an ancient manuscript, the Cerddorion counterpart to The Book of Utter Darkness, disappeared from my library. It contains the history of our race, along with spells and prophecies—including spells for imprisoning and releasing the Morfran. I always suspected Pryce stole it, but I wasn’t overly worried. I know the book by heart, and its spells are written in code and protected by wards to prevent their magic from being misused.” She frowned. “But it seems he’s found a way around the protections. North Wales has major Morfran deposits. When Pryce moves to free that Morfran, we must be ready to counter him. We must prevent the Morfran from reaching its critical mass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Show me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squared her shoulders and stood with her feet hip-width apart. “First you must coalesce the Morfran energy, like this.” She held the athame in her left hand and swung her arm in big, clockwise circles over her head, like she was swinging a lasso. “You do it with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling way too Annie Oakley, I used my left arm to copy the circles she was making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Left pulls the energy in,” Mab said as her arm circled. “By making this motion with the athame, you’re drawing the Morfran toward you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven what the Morfran had done to those three zombies, bringing the Morfran closer sounded like a bad idea, but I nodded and kept spinning my imaginary lasso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll feel coldness pass into the blade. When you do, make the circles smaller. Like this.” She demonstrated, and I followed her. “Draw the Morfran in very close. Let the coldness move up your arm. Watch for a shift in the Morfran energy. It feels—how to describe it?—it feels the way it sounds when one instrument in an orchestra plays a terribly wrong note. That’s the signal to do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a lightning-fast movement, chanting unfamiliar words, she shifted the athame to her right hand and pointed it at the slate tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved too fast for me to follow her. I realized I was still making circles with my left arm, so I stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Use your right hand to project outward, sending the energy where you want it to go. Basically, you throw the Morfran into the slate. Once it lands there, it can’t get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the incantation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A word of command, a word of direction, and a word of binding: Parhau! Ireos! Mantrigo!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What language is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An ancient language of power. It’s never been spoken in the ordinary world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other ways, Mab had said, to gain understanding of the language of Hell. Was that the language that commanded the Morfran? A chill shot down my spine. I mouthed the words several times, trying to remember them. My demon mark itched with each syllable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mab, what about my demon mark? You used your right arm to point Hellforged at the slate. What if the mark won’t let me do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pursed her lips, considering. “I don’t believe that will be a problem. The mark prevents you from raising that arm against the Destroyer, true. But it should be no impediment to directing the Morfran. I’d imagine, rather, that the mark should aid you in sending the Morfran where you wish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Destroyer’s mark might help me? That’d be a first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kept practicing, Mab holding the athame and me empty-handed, until I had the basic sequence down: Circle, draw the Morfran in—closer, closer—then switch hands and hurl the energy at the target, locking it there with the incantation. Each time I said the command words in that strange language, a pulse of energy buzzed down my arm, through the demon mark, and out the tips of my fingers. I was almost eager to try the ritual with Hellforged in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we finished, my left arm was sore from circling and the long Welsh twilight had settled in. Mab took Hellforged into the house, while I stayed outside to do some stretches. As I worked the kinks out of my shoulders, a motion overhead caught my eye. I let my arms drop and looked up. A crow flew silently from the woods that edged the lawn, its wings moving in slow, heavy flaps, and alighted in the tree above the practice target. The bird sat in the winter-bare branches and cocked its head. There were no colors in the dim light, just a black crow in a black tree against a gray landscape, its bright black eye staring at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I’d been hearing too much about the Great Crow, but the sight unnerved me. I walked a few paces toward the house, then turned back. The bird didn’t move, but it watched me. I stared at it, then slowly raised my right arm and pointed at the slate. “Parhau,” I whispered. “Ireos. Mantrigo.” Energy fizzed along my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crow cawed once, but that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately I felt silly. It was only a bird. And I hadn’t even done the ritual right. I turned and hurried toward Maenllyd and its warm, yellow windows, feeling the crow’s gaze on my back every step of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS FOLLOWED A PATTERN: MORNINGS, I’d try to read The Book of Utter Darkness. After lunch, a nap, and then I’d practice with Hellforged. Despite Mab’s repeated reminders that we were running out of time, I didn’t make much progress. The book refused to cooperate. Hour after hour, I’d stare at its pages, keeping my mind blank, never knowing for sure whether a thought was arising from my own mind or coming from the book. Lights swam across my vision and my head ached, but the book kept its secrets or mocked me by repeating Pryce’s damn prophecy: From a goddess two lines diverged, but they shall be reunited in Victory. One morning, I got a glimmer of something else: And shall thrice-tested Victory be conquered? The words flickered across my mind, then went dark. One whole sentence—big deal. Pryce had proclaimed there’d be three tests, so it wasn’t even news. The book remained silent about the things I needed to know—like what even one of those tests would be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hellforged-deadtown-2/page-33.html","bookId":2610,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:26 PM"}
