It was no longer possible for the aliens to simply transfer themselves aboard. Even at the level of Nirvana the creatures couldn’t master the Creation and Destruction Domain enough to teleport themselves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn fact even the three home worlds couldn’t transfer. Only the Violet Prince and Princess had the innate energy and depth of knowledge of their Domain to do so. Even still the requirement in energy was immense. It was for that reason the Prince didn’t immediately destroy Lan Jue upon appearing within Middle Heaven. If he hadn’t already been drained by the transference, even Xiuxiu’s interruption wouldn’t have saved Lan Jue from him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs the fight stretched on both the Prince and Princess were recovering their stored of energy.

At least one needed to be brought back, though the more he could capture the better. Best was if the Prince could wrest all four from the hands of their enemy. Three were brought to bear against him now, but his first order of business was to kill one human in particular.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFor the time being he was unreachable.

The other human defenders could collapse at any moment, and the situation could quickly turn bad for his prey. Lan Jue and Qianlin could only help defend one group, possibly killing one of his own. But if the two could be separated the danger to his side would be mitigated.

He raced forward with the deadly point of Captus aimed in the Pharmacist’s direction. Her situation was the most precarious as three Nirvana-level elite had surrounded her.

The Violet Prince paused, surprised at how poorly organized the humans’ defenses were.

The sparkling light of Lan Jue’s Boundless Starlight Domain was the backdrop that surrounded them, and as the power of the Harmonious Swords cut through it the light suddenly changed direction. The Prince spied a faint figure that seemed to guide it – toward the three fleeing avatars and the Violet Princess.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEverything happened in the space of an instant.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Violet Princess had her battle firmly in hand. The energy she’d spent in the transportation was gradually returning, and with each passing moment she was coming closer to overpowering the Paragons.

It wasn’t the fight time she’d faced Lan Jue and Qianlin, and the power they bore frightened her. It’d taken her and her ‘brother’ to defeat Lan Jue and the Pharmacist last time.

The Bookworm and Keeper were not considered powerhouses among the Paragons, but they were among the most experienced.

As her options for defense were stripped away all of them came at her, throwing caution to the wind in return for a chance to end her life. Lan Jue and Qianlin’s deadly ray was blocking her only route. Suddenly she found herself in a fatal predicament with no option. She had to try and defend against a direct hit from the Harmonious Swords.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Violet Prince’s pupils had contracted to pinpricks.
