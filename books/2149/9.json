But when first bell rang and he still didn\u0027t show, I had no choice but to go into class. Brandon\u0027s seat remained empty. The clock above the chalkboard ticked as my mind raced. Had Dr. Maddox put Brandon on a plane to Europe? Had he taken him to a local hospital? Or was Brandon locked inside his guesthouse like he\u0027d asked me to do once before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you today?\" Ivy asked when the bell rang for lunch later that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you are worried about lunch,\" she said. \"But I guess you don\u0027t have to feel compelled to sit with Brandon since he\u0027s not here today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you worried about coming back to our table?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh . . . yeah, I can\u0027t sit there with Heidi. It would be too weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had a talk with the guys,\" Abby said authoritatively. \"Heidi won\u0027t be sitting at our table. And if she does, we won\u0027t be sitting with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Ivy concurred. \"We told Jake and Dylan that if she does, then they can eat alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them no tramps allowed!\" Ivy said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it worked,\" Abby said as we entered the caf. \"Look - the guys are all waiting for us and no sign of any cheerleaders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends really did have my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy sat by Jake, and Abby by Dylan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused for a moment when I came upon my empty seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can spray it for germs,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby laughed, and I did as well. I was glad to be back to normal - or somewhat normal - and sat down in my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash slid in next to me. He grinned a wide, toothpaste-commercial smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to have you back, Celeste,\" he said. \"You know why I did it. Just to show you what you\u0027d be missing. Like you\u0027ve been showing me what I\u0027ve been missing by being with Brandon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not why - \" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said resignedly. \"But it hit home with me and I thought maybe it would with you, too. I\u0027m trying to start over,\" he said. \"I thought you might like this.\" He handed me a single rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash had never before displayed such a romantic gesture, public or private, and I wasn\u0027t sure how to handle it. It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t like Nash. I did. But as a couple we were more different than alike. However, I admired him as a friend and still cared for him. And now that he was bent on changing and becoming a more mature and serious suitor, I couldn\u0027t help but feel awkward. I didn\u0027t want to reject him in front of our friends, and I really didn\u0027t want Brandon to walk in and see me holding a rose from another guy. Nash was charming and charismatic, but I couldn\u0027t help but be in love with the one guy who wasn\u0027t in the lunchroom today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said sincerely. I imagined Nash taking the time to buy it at a store on his way to school, and the flower was beautiful. It was truly sweet and thoughtful. I had to admit I was flattered that he was thinking of me in this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw!\" my friends cooed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s so romantic,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Why can\u0027t you guys be more like Nash?\" Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He brought another girl to our table yesterday,\" Dylan charged. \"That\u0027s what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why she was here,\" Nash retorted. \"Celeste knows the real reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, to get back at her for sitting next to Brandon,\" Jake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Nash said, still in the hot seat. \"That\u0027s not why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why?\" Jake asked. Nash wasn\u0027t used to talking feelings in front of our clique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nervously drummed his fingers on the table and fidgeted trying to come up with the right words. \"I wanted her to see what life was like without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked. I was surprised to see Nash lay his feelings out so honestly before everyone. He was truly changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends must have been as surprised as I was. They paused for a moment, then Ivy and Abby sighed. \"How romantic,\" they said in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan and Jake rolled their eyes and burst into laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow - you are the charmer,\" Dylan said, nudging his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was more like a prank?\" Jake whispered. \"To get back at her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . yes,\" Nash agreed, but I knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, you are good,\" Dylan said softly. \"It really worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s put the flower in a cup and we can use it as our centerpiece,\" Ivy suggested. Before she could take it from me, I placed it on my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll put it away for later,\" I said. I gingerly placed the rose in my backpack, out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we started to settle in, my mind drifted away from our table, and I glanced over to Brandon\u0027s table and saw his seat still empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan must have caught sight of me gazing toward the Westsider\u0027s table. \"Finally we don\u0027t have to see you girls fussing over that weirdo,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t fuss over him,\" Ivy shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet you do,\" Dylan went on. \"Since he returned your dog, it\u0027s like you\u0027ve started an Eastside chapter of the Brandon Maddox Fan Club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jealous?\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even close!\" Dylan scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now you see how he is,\" Jake said. \"Probably so freaked out he can\u0027t come to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you wanted?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, no. But you don\u0027t want to be seen with a wolfman, do you?\" Dylan snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we don\u0027t want to be seen with an airhead cheerleader, either,\" Abby shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we began eating, I did feel a sense of relief being back with my friends. Of course, I longed to be with Brandon, but since he wasn\u0027t even here, I was glad to have Ivy\u0027s and Abby\u0027s usual lighthearted banter take my mind off of what had happened last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked again at Brandon\u0027s table, where his seat remained empty. I wondered where he might be and what he might be up to. Nash must have noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it would work,\" Nash said so only I could hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came back because I wanted to sit with my friends,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am one of your friends, right?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. But . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ve been more . . .\" he hinted. \"Your boyfriend, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still a full moon,\" he said. \"Creatures will be out tonight. Dangerous ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your voice down.\" I tried to shush him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you came back to me. You made the right choice this time. My plan worked. I knew if you saw me with someone, you\u0027d remember what you were missing. And here you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that isn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I wanted, Celeste. And I think you did, too.\" He reached his hand across the table and placed it over mine. Ivy and Abby caught his move and winked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but note the irony. I\u0027d spent nights being kissed by Nash and was often happy in his strong embrace at movies or parties. But too often, I\u0027d felt like I wasn\u0027t important to him. I had to compete with his athletic schedule. He paid more attention to leather balls and winning scores than to me. Now that I wasn\u0027t paying him attention and was focused on Brandon, Nash seemed to see it as a challenge that he couldn\u0027t face with a team behind him. He needed to win this one on his own, and he wasn\u0027t giving up the fight. With basketball ending and baseball beginning, Nash had time to take on another sport - love. Nash appeared driven to win, and his courting me this way would have made him more attractive if I hadn\u0027t been so distracted with Brandon. Otherwise, his attention was tempting, to say the least. It was hard not to fall under his charms - I\u0027d had feelings for him, and they hadn\u0027t gone away completely. I\u0027d just had deeper feelings for someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could withdraw my hand from Nash\u0027s, Ivy snapped a picture with her cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys could get Cutest Couple in Class. I\u0027ll send this off to the yearbook,\" she said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy was happiest when the sixsome was intact. I couldn\u0027t blame her. I wanted everyone to be happy, too, but I wasn\u0027t sure that my happiness was the same as hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch, I headed off to the annex buildings to philosophy and I heard a whistle coming from the wooded area behind the gym. When I heard it again, I took a closer look and saw a figure standing in the brush. It was Brandon. I raced down the hill as fast as I could. I reached him to find him wearing only jeans. He appeared worn out and exhausted. He had twigs in his hair and dirt stains on his jeans and body. And though it wasn\u0027t winter, there was still a nip in the air. He was shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take my hoodie,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t listen to him. Instead, I unzipped and removed my jacket and wrapped it around his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ve been so worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t go home last night,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been out all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ran away?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t run away - I just didn\u0027t go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to see your father. He\u0027s the only one who can help you. He\u0027s already sent in your samples. Maybe he can work on a cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - I can\u0027t let him see me like this. You saw how he acted. I shouldn\u0027t have called him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final bell began to ring off in the distance. \"You have to go - \" he said. \"I have to go - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Meet me after school. I\u0027ll text you where I\u0027ll be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew me into him and gave me a kiss that made me forget about classes, school, and life without my hoodie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a leaf in your hair,\" Abby said when I finally got to my seat in philosophy. \"What gives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, I guess it just fell from a tree,\" I said. I untangled the stem from my hair and removed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your hoodie?\" Ivy asked. \"You were wearing it at lunch. It\u0027s too cold for a T-shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . I\u0027m fine,\" I said. \"Spring is almost here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not here today,\" Ivy said. \"I think she\u0027s just heated up from her lunch with Nash.\" She put her arm around me. \"Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said, resigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are all going out tonight,\" Ivy said. \"The guys are free and so are we.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should we do?\" Abby asked. \"Bowling? Indoor putt-putt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mall?\" Ivy suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guys hate the mall,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was distracted, thinking of the one person I wanted to be sharing the evening with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hang out and watch movies,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been to my house already,\" Abby whined. \"And my mom\u0027s pissed that her snow globe was broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We go to mine all the time,\" Ivy remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why don\u0027t you come to mine?\" I asked, joking. I knew it was a safe invite, and maybe the whole evening would be canceled since we couldn\u0027t agree on a location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We never go to yours,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a reason,\" I replied. \"I don\u0027t have a basketball court in the basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, neither do we,\" Ivy challenged. \"I think it\u0027s a great idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your house is so cozy,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and your parents are cool,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . I can\u0027t,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asked. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t, in fact.
