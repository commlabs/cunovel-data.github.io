He frantically reviewed his plan to make sure there were no holes in it; after all, if he made the slightest mistake, there would be no hope of making a comeback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt anything will happen that I couldn’t adjust for…. I couldn’t have prepared any better….” He felt a bit better after a thorough analysis, but still couldn’t stop wondering about what might or might not happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus, he and Hei Ming proceeded along in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the moment Bai Xiaochun had chosen not to consult the Grand Heavenmaster, but instead to attack the Zhou Clan with deadly force and lightning-like speed, he had known that it would cause a huge commotion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had no regrets. He didn’t trust and rely on the Grand Heavenmaster like he had in the past, and Bai Hao’s safety had been of paramount importance. If even the slightest word had gotten out to alerts his enemies, the consequences could have been unimaginable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just as the Giant Ghost King had surmised, he had dared to act in the way he had because he had a secret weapon ready to go!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet all of the heavenly marquises and dukes are there in Heavenmaster Hall, demanding that I be put to death….” Although he had his secret weapon, he still couldn\u0027t help but feel a bit anxious. However, it was an anxiety mixed with anticipation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t wait to reveal his secret weapon to all of the important officials in the dynasty. And when that happened, the more they had antagonized him in the past, the louder the sound of the figurative slaps to their faces would be!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the past, I always relied on the power of the Grand Heavenmaster to fight with the aristocracy. But now… I\u0027m not going to rely on anybody except myself! I\u0027m going to personally slap them all, right upside the face!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“89 heavenly marquises. 10 heavenly dukes…. 99 important members of the aristocracy. I wonder what it will feel like to slap them….” The more he thought about it, the stronger his anticipation grew, to the point where he had trouble breathing calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, he and Hei Ming were in the imperial palace, and heading toward Heavenmaster Hall. As he walked along, his heart rate increased, and his nervous anticipation grew more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, when they were very close to their destination, Hei Ming suddenly stopped in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was so wrapped up in his thoughts of what was to come that he was taken completely by surprise, and almost walked right into Hei Ming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment passed, Hei Ming said, “You acted… recklessly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his voice was just as sinister as it normally was, if one listened carefully, one would be able to detect a bit of concern!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bai Xiaochun realized that, he looked surprised. Hei Ming had always acted very cold and detached, and therefore, this sudden presence of concern was totally unexpected!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Ming didn\u0027t turn around. Back facing Bai Xiaochun, he said, “All the heavenly marquises and all the heavenly dukes… are working together. Even if the Grand Heavenmaster wanted to shield you from them, it would be very difficult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough no one was there to see it, mixed emotions were in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could tell that a storm of extermination was brewing in Heavenmaster Hall, a potential catastrophe for Bai Xiaochun. Furthermore, many of the things Bai Xiaochun had done in his time as the inspections commissioner caused Hei Ming to think back to when he had held the same office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, it would be hard to find someone else in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty who could sympathize with how Bai Xiaochun felt better than Hei Ming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had both been inspections commissioners. And right now, the events which were playing out closely resembled what had occurred to Hei Ming all those years ago. The main difference was that Hei Ming had a very close personal relationship to the Grand Heavenmaster, and as such, had been protected. He had escaped death in that situation, and had stuck like a shadow to the Grand Heavenmaster ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost importantly, he had actually not committed a crime as serious as killing a heavenly marquis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in many ways, Bai Xiaochun’s situation was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your only hope is the Grand Heavenmaster…. Bai Hao, you must… look out for yourself.” Sighing, he proceeded onward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun looked at Hei Ming as he walked off, and was moved. He had always taken Hei Ming to be cold and distant, but now, when Bai Xiaochun was facing imminent calamity, the fact that he had offered comforting words warmed his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered intently at Hei Ming’s back for a moment, then nodded softly and continued onward… to Heavenmaster Hall!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a sound could be heard from the closed door of the hall. However, as soon as he got close, he could sense that a complex, violent aura pulsed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Ming faded away into nothing, and Bai Xiaochun stood there waiting. A long moment passed, whereupon a voice echoed out from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come in, Bai Hao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun shivered and took a deep, long breath. He knew that the show was about to begin, which made him nervous, but at the same time, more excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fudge, what do I have to be scared of? My secret weapon is so awesome that I’ll be able to slap those dukes and marquises until they look as ugly as pigs! They’re just waiting inside for me to go beat them up, right?! If they’re not afraid, then what am I afraid for?! Heck, it would be a shame to \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003ehit them considering they’re sticking their faces out right in front of me and just waiting around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting his teeth, he stepped forward and pushed the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, more than a hundred gazes locked onto him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weakest of those gazes belonged to a half-deva, and the strongest belonged to a demigod. All of the aristocracy of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, all of the most powerful experts, were gathered here, their gazes fused together to create pressure that could shake all creation. Even with his secret weapon, Bai Xiaochun couldn’t help but lose much of his nerve thanks to all of those gazes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grand Heavenmaster sat on the Heavenmaster Throne at the head of the hall, a grim look on his face. The ten heavenly dukes stood beneath him, their expressions icy cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came the 89 heavenly marquises…. they were now all of the heavenly marquises remaining in Arch-Emperor City, and all of them were looking coldly at Bai Xiaochun. Some had cold smiles, some had sneers, and other had eyes filled with pure killing intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s heart was pounding, and sweat began to pop out on his forehead. For the first time in his life… he found himself at a disadvantage in a staring contest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was little he could do about it. After all, he was single-handedly facing more than a hundred people!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What shameless bullies!” he thought, shivering inwardly. However, he couldn’t let them defeat his spirit before he even walked through the door. Gritting his teeth, he looked through the crowd until he found Zhao Xionglin staring viciously at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter how many they have on their side!” he thought. “Lord Bai can at least defeat one of them! No surrender!” With that, he glared back steadily at Zhao Xionglin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Xionglin was clearly taken by surprise, and couldn’t help but think of the friction which had occurred between the two of them. All of a sudden, he felt uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With all these people staring at him,” he thought, “why did he have to latch onto me! What’s he doing?!” He was immediately enraged. Unfortunately for him, though, he was definitely not as skilled in staring contests as Bai Xiaochun was. Bai Xiaochun’s gaze looked like it was filled with blade light and sword projections, a windstorm of blood and carnage, a type of madness that seemed to be willing to die fighting with the enemy! Zhao Xionglin was shaken, and could only assume that in the face of death, this mad dog was somehow going to try to kill him as he went out….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he thought about all the incredible things Bai Xiaochun had accomplished so far, and how, despite being faced with so many enemies in one place, he was still acting like this. That in itself was very telling. Before long, Zhao Xionglin was completely convinced of his earlier theory, and considering how dangerous that made things for him, he finally just looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that Zhao Xionglin didn\u0027t dare to look at him caused Bai Xiaochun’s spirits to soar. “Think you can take me on?” he thought. “Yellow-bellied wimp!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling very impressive, he stepped into Heavenmaster Hall, clasped hands and bowed to the Grand Heavenmaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your humble servant Bai Hao offers greetings, Grand Heavenmaster!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-802\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-804\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-803","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
