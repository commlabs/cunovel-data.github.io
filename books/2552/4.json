He\u0027d stayed up mos t of the night and let Zev sleep. The old guy needed his rest. Sleep would have been impossible for Joe anyway. He was too wired. So he\u0027d sat up, star ing at the back of St. Anthony\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undead had left before first light, dark shapes drifting out the doors an d across the grass like parishioners leaving a predawn service. Joe had felt his teeth grind as he scanned the group for Palmeri, but he couldn\u0027t make him out in the dimness. He might have gone out the front. By the time the sun ha d begun to peek over the rooftops and through the trees to the east, the stre ets outside were deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke Zev and together they walked around to the front of the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy oak and iron doors, each forming half of a pointed arch, were clo sed. Joe pulled them open and fastened the hooks to hold them back. Then, t aking a breath, he walked through the vestibule and into the nave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he was ready for it, the stench backed him up a few steps. Whe n his stomach settled, he forced himself ahead, treading a path between th e two piles of shattered and splintered pews. Zev walked beside him, a han dkerchief pressed over his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night he had thought the place a shambles. He saw now that it was wors e. The light of day poked into all the corners, revealing everything that h ad been hidden by the warm glow of the candles. Half a dozen rotting corpse s hung from the ceiling - he hadn\u0027t noticed them last night - and others were s prawled on the floor against the walls. Some of the bodies lay in pieces. Behind the chancel rail a headless female torso was draped over the front of the pulpit. To the left stood the statue of Mary. Someone had fitted her w ith foam rubber breasts and a huge dildo. And at the rear of the sanctuary was the armless Christ hanging head down on the upright of his cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My church,\" he whispered as he moved along the path that had once been th e center aisle, the aisle once walked by daily communicants and brides wit h their proud fathers. \"Look what they\u0027ve done to my church!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe approached the huge block of the altar. When he\u0027d first arrived at St. A nthony\u0027s it had been backed against the far wall of the sanctuary, but he\u0027d had it moved to the front so that he could celebrate Mass facing his parishi oners. Solid Carrara marble, but you\u0027d never know it now. So caked with drie d blood, semen, and feces it could have been made of styrofoam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis revulsion was fading, melting away in the growing heat of his rage, dra wing the nausea with it. He had intended to clean up the place but there wa s too much to be done, too much for two men. It was hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fadda Joe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun at the sound of the strange voice. A thin figure stood uncertainly in the open doorway. A timid-looking man of about fifty edged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fadda Joe, that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe recognized him now. Carl Edwards. A twitchy little man who used to hel p pass the collection basket at 10:30 Mass on Sundays. A transplantee from Jersey City - hardly anyone around here was originally from around here. Hi s face was sunken, his eyes feverish as he stared at Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Carl. It\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank God!\" He ran forward and dropped to his knees before Joe. He began to sob. \"You come back! Thank God, you come back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe pulled him to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on now, Carl. Get a grip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You come back to save us, ain\u0027tcha? God sent you here to punish him, didn\u0027t He?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Punish whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fadda Palmeri! He\u0027s one a them! He\u0027s the worst of alia them! He - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Joe said. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s so good to have ya back, Fadda Joe! We ain\u0027t knowed what to do si nce the suckers took over. We been prayin for someone like you and now ya h ere. It\u0027s a freakin miracle!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe wanted to ask Carl where he and all these people who seemed to think t hey needed him now had been when he was being railroaded out of the parish. But that was ancient history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a miracle, Carl,\" Joe said, glancing at Zev. \"Rabbi Wolpin brought me back.\" As Carl and Zev shook hands, Joe said, \"And I\u0027m just passing throu gh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Passing through? No. Don\u0027t say that! Ya gotta stay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe saw the light of hope fading in the little man\u0027s eyes and something twist ed within, tugging at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do here, Carl? I\u0027m just one man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help! I\u0027ll do whatever ya want! Just tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you help me clean up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl looked around and seemed to see the cadavers for the first time. He cri nged and turned a few shades paler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah ... sure. Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked at Zev. \"Well? What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev shrugged. \"I should tell you what to do? My parish it\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not mine either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev jutted his beard at Carl. \"I think maybe he\u0027d tell you differendy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe did a slow turn. The vaulted nave was utterly silent except for the buzz ing of the flies around the cadavers. A massive cleanup job. But if they wor ked all day they could make a decent dent in it. And then -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe didn\u0027t know. He was playing this by ear. He\u0027d wait and see what the nigh t brought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you get us some food, Carl? I\u0027d sell my soul for a cup of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl gave him a strange look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a figure of speech, Carl. We\u0027ll need some food if we\u0027re going to keep working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s eyes lit again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That means ya staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll getcha some food,\" he said excitedly as he ran for the door. \"And coff ee. I know someone who\u0027s still got coffee. She\u0027ll part with some of it for F\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadda Joe.\" He stopped at the door and turned. \"Ay, and Fadda, I never believ ed any of them things was said aboutcha. Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe tried but he couldn\u0027t hold it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have meant a lot to have heard that from you then, Carl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man lowered his eyes. \"Yeah. I guess it woulda. But I\u0027ll make it up to ya, Fadda. I will. You can take that to the bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was out the door and gone. Joe turned to Zev and saw the old man ro lling up his sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nu?\" Zev said. \"The bodies. Before we do anything else, I think maybe we should move the bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZEV . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy early afternoon, Zev was exhausted. The heat and the heavy work had taken their toll. He had to stop and rest. He sat on the chancel rail and looked around. Nearly eight hours work and they\u0027d barely scratched the surface. But the place did look and smell better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemoving the flyblown corpses and scattered body parts had been the worst of it. A foul, gut-roiling task that had taken most of the morning. They\u0027d car ried the corpses out to the small graveyard behind the church and left them there. Those people deserved a decent burial but there was no time for it to day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the corpses were gone, Father Joe had torn the defilements from the stat ue of Mary and then they\u0027d turned their attention to the huge crucifix. It to ok a while but they finally found Christ\u0027s plaster arms in the pile of ruined pews. Both still were nailed to the sawed-off crosspieces of the crucifix. While Zev and Joe worked at jury-rigging a series of braces to reattach the ar ms,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl found a mop and bucket and began the long, slow process of washing the fouled floor of the nave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the crucifix was intact again - the life-size plaster Jesus had his arms r eattached and was once again nailed to his refurbished cross. Joe and Carl h ad restored him to his former position of dominance. The poor Nazarene was u pright again, hanging over the center of the sanctuary in all his tortured s plendor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grisly sight. Zev never could understand the Catholic attachment to these gruesome statues. But if the undead loathed them, then Zev was for them al l the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stomach rumbled with hunger. At least they\u0027d had a good breakfast. Car l had returned from his food run this morning with fresh-baked bread, pean ut butter, and two thermoses of hot coffee. He wished now they\u0027d saved som e. Maybe there was a crust of bread left in the sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed back to the vestibule to check and found an aluminum pot and a pa per bag sitting by the door. The pot was hot and full of beef stew, the sac k contained three cans of Pepsi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked his head out the doors but saw no one on the street outside. It had been that way all day - he\u0027d spy a figure or two peeking in the front doors; they\u0027d hover there for a moment as if to confirm that what they had heard wa s true, then they\u0027d scurry away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the meal that had been left. A group of the locals must h ave donated from their hoard of canned stew and precious soft drinks to fix this. Zev was touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to call out to Joe and Carl when a shadow fell across the floo r. He looked up and saw a young woman in a leather jacket standing in the d oorway. The first thing he did was check for her right ear for one of those cursed crescents. Easy enough to see with her close-cropped, almost boyish brown hair. She didn\u0027t. Such a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" He straightened and faced her. \"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t this St. Anthony\u0027s church?\" she said, making a face as she looked arou nd at the destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was. We\u0027re trying to make it so again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze had come to rest on his yarmulke. \"But you\u0027re a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A rabbi, yes. Rabbi Zev Wolpin, at your service.\" He gestured around him a t the church. \"Such a long story, you wouldn\u0027t believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. A pretty smile. \"I\u0027ll bet. I\u0027m looking for my uncle. He was a pries t here but he left. I need to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev felt a lightness in his chest. \"His name wouldn\u0027t happen to be Cahill, wo uld it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile broadened. \"Yeah. Father Joe Cahill. You know where he might b e?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I do.\" He turned and called into the nave. \"Father Joe! You have company!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLACEY . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey totally lost it when she recognized the tall, broad-shouldered man str iding toward her through the rubble of the church. He needed a shave, he nee ded a haircut, and his faded jeans and flannel shirt were anything but pries tly, but she knew those blue eyes and the smile that lit his face when he sa w her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Joe!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself running forward and flinging herself at him, sobbing unas hamedly and uncontrollably as she clung to him like a drowning sailor to a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lacey, Lacey,\" he cooed, holding her tight against him. \"It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she got hold of herself and eased her deathgrip on him. She wiped he r eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that. It\u0027s just...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said, taking her hands in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey looked up at her uncle. Did he? Did he realize what she\u0027d been throu gh to get here? She\u0027d thought she was tough, but the trip from Manhattan h ad taken her longer than she could have imagined, and put to shame every n ightmare she\u0027d ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are your mom and dad?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the forlorn hope in his eyes - her mother was his older sister - but h ad to shake her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I tried to contact them when the shit hit the - I mean, when e verything went to hell, but the lines were down and everything was chaos. I got to wondering if they\u0027d even bothered trying to get in touch with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they did,\" Uncle Joe said. \"Of course they did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be so sure? They\u0027ve refused to speak to me for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny way of showing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not rejecting you, Lacey, just your lifestyle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One\u0027s pretty much wrapped up in the other, don\u0027t you think. At least you ke pt talking to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been moved as a kid from Brooklyn to New Jersey when her father lan ded a job with a big pharmaceutical company in Florham Park, but New York had remained in her blood. When it came time for college her first and l ast choice had been NYU, for reasons beyond what it offered academically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts location in Greenwich Village had been equally important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause somewhere along her years in high school Lacey Flannery had realize d she wasn\u0027t like the other girls. She needed an accepting atmosphere, a pl ace where anything goes, to stretch her boundaries and find out about herse lf, learn who she really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her second year at NYU she moved into an off-campus apartment with a s enior named Janey Birnbaum. At the time her folks thought they were just roommates. Three years ago, right after her graduation with a BA in Engli sh, she came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when her folks stopped speaking to her. She\u0027d tried to visit the m, tried to explain, but they hadn\u0027t wanted to see or speak to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one person in the family she\u0027d found she could talk to was, of all peopl e, her uncle the Catholic priest. Uncle Joe hadn\u0027t approved but he didn\u0027t tu rn her away. He\u0027d tried to act as go-between but her folks stood firm: eithe r get counseling and get cured - like she was mentally ill or something! - or st ay away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a feeling her father was behind the hard line, but she couldn\u0027t be sure. Now she might never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rabbi said, \"So may I ask, what is it, this lifestyle, that your parents reje ct but a priest doesn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a dyke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rabbi blinked. Probably the first time anyone had ever put it to him that bluntly. She also noticed her uncle\u0027s grimace. Obviously he didn\u0027t like the word. Lacey hadn\u0027t liked it either at first, but Janey and her more radical f riends encouraged her to use to it because they were taking it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all fine back then, but now... take it back from whom?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t that mean a lesbian?\" the rabbi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through and through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just a garden-variety lesbian,\" Uncle Joe said. His wry smile looked fo rced. \"A radical lesbian feminist, and an outspoken one at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot to mention atheist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile faded a little. \"I try to forget that part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken Lacey awhile to come out, but when she did she decided not to be out partway. She wasn\u0027t ashamed of who she was or how she felt and was r eady to get in the face of anyone who tried to give her grief about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d started writing articles and reviews for the underground press - the radical, the gay, even the entertainment freebies - with the hope of eventu ally moving above ground. Her role model was Norah Vincent, who\u0027d been wr iting a regular column for the Village Voice - back when there\u0027d been a Vil lage Voice. Lacey didn\u0027t always agree with her views but she envied her p ulpit. She\u0027d vowed that someday she\u0027d have a column like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that dream was gone now, along with so many others ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" she said, \"I hadn\u0027t been able to contact Mom and Dad, so I decid ed to check up on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been all alone then. Janey had gone out one day, scrounging for foo d, and never come back. After spending a week looking for her, Lacey had to face the unthinkable: Janey was either dead or had been turned into an undead. Crushed, grieving, and with New York becoming more dangerous eve ry day, she\u0027d decided to go home. She fought her way through the Holland Tunnel - the living collaborators hadn\u0027t closed it off yet - and made it to h er folks\u0027 place in Union, New Jersey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I got to their house, I found the front door smashed in and blood on th e living-room rug.\" She felt herself puddling up, her throat tightening like a noose. \"I don\u0027t think they made it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped they were alive or dead, anything but in between. They\u0027d rejected her, they\u0027d caused her untold pain - though she\u0027d probably given as good as she got on that score - but they were still her parents and the thought of he r mother and father prowling the night, sucking blood . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d nurtured the hope that with time they\u0027d have come to accept her as sh e was - she\u0027d never expected approval, but maybe just enough acceptance to in vite her back for dinner some night. It didn\u0027t look like that was ever goin g to happen now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Joe wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \"I...\" His voice choked off a nd the two of them stood still and silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was your brother, Joe?\" the rabbi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My big sister. Cathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Uncle Joe said. \"So am I.\" He cleared his throat. \"But we can hope for the best, can\u0027t we? And in the meantime, lunch is getting cold. Are you hungry, Lacey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was famished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZEV . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tastes like Dinty Moore,\" Joe said around a mouthful of the stew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" Lacey said. \"I ate a lot of this before I turned vegan. I recognize the l ittle potatoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev found the stew palatable but much too salty. He wasn\u0027t about to complai n, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were feasting in the sacristy, the small room off the sanctuary where t he priests had kept their vestments - a clerical Green Room, so to speak. Joe and Lacey sat side by side. Carl and Zev sat apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s vegan?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who eats only veggies,\" Lacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Being a vegan was a luxury. Now I eat whatever I can find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl laughed. \"Fadda, the ladies of the parish must be real excited about yo u coming back to break into their canned goods like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev said, \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever had anything like this before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be surprised if you had,\" said Joe. \"I doubt very much that something tha t calls itself Dinty Moore is kosher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev smiled but inside he was suddenly filled with a great sadness. Kosher. . . how meaningless now seemed all the observances that he had allowed t o rule and circumscribe his life. Such a fierce proponent of strict dietar y laws he\u0027d been in the days before the Lakewood holocaust. But those days were gone, just as the Lakewood community was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Zev was a changed man. If he hadn\u0027t changed, if he were still observin g, he couldn\u0027t sit here and sup with these two men and this young woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d have to be elsewhere, eating special classes of ritually prepared food s off separate sets of dishes. But really, hadn\u0027t division been the main th rust of holding to the dietary laws in modern times? They served a purpose beyond mere observance of tradition. They placed another wall between obser vant Jews and outsiders, keeping them separate even from fellow Jews who di dn\u0027t observe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev took another big bite of the stew. Time to break down all the walls betwe en people... while there was still enough time and people left alive to ma ke it matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay, Zev?\" Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev nodded silently, afraid to speak for fear of sobbing. Despite all its ana chronisms, he missed his life in the good old days of a few months ago. Gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all gone. The rich traditions, the culture, the friends, the prayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt adrift - in time and in space. Nowhere was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was the matter of the cross ... the power of the cross over the undead . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d sneaked a copy of Dracula to read when he was a boy, and he\u0027d caught snatches of vampire movies on TV. The undead were always portrayed as afra id of crosses. But that had been fiction. Vampires weren\u0027t real - or so he\u0027d thought - and so he\u0027d never examined the broader implications of that fear of the cross. Now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\" Joe seemed genuinely concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m okay. As okay as you could expect me to feel after spending the bet ter part of the day repairing a crucifix and eating non-kosher food. And let me tell you, that\u0027s not so okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his bowl aside and straightened from his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, already. Let\u0027s get back to work. There\u0027s much yet to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOE . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost sunset,\" Carl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe straightened from scrubbing the marble altar and stared west through o ne of the smashed windows. The sun was out of sight behind the houses ther e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go now, Carl,\" he said to the little man. \"Thanks for your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you gonna go, Fadda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be staying right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl\u0027s prominent Adam\u0027s apple bobbed convulsively as he swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Well then, I\u0027m staying too. I told you I\u0027d make it up to ya, didn\u0027t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn\u0027 besides, I don\u0027t think the suckers\u0027U like the new, improved St. Ant\u0027ny\u0027s too much when they come back tonight. I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll even get through the doors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe smiled at the man, then looked around. Luckily it was May and the days were growing longer. They\u0027d had time to make a difference here. The floor s were clean, the crucifix was restored and back in its proper position, a s were most of the Stations of the Cross plaques. Zev had found them under the pews and had taken the ones not shattered beyond recognition and rehu ng them on the walls. Lots of new crosses littered those walls. Carl had f ound a hammer and nails and had made dozens of them from the remains of th e pews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll like the new decor one bit. But there\u0027s so mething you can get us if you can, Carl. Guns. Pistols, rifles, shotguns, anyth ing that shoots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl nodded slowly. \"I know a few guys who can help in that department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And some wine. A little red wine if anybody\u0027s saved some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re planning Custer\u0027s last stand, maybe?\" Zev said from where he was tac king the last of Carl\u0027s crude crosses to the east wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like the Alamo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same result,\" Zev said with one of his shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a gun,\" Lacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe stared at her. She\u0027d been helping him scrub the altar. \"You do? Why did n\u0027t you say something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only got two bullets left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are the rest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his gaze evenly. \"I had to leave them behind in a couple of people wh o tried to stop me. It was a tough trip getting here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Better than I thought I\u0027d be. You do what you have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat an amazing young woman, he thought. Who\u0027d have thought Cathy\u0027s little girl could turn out so tough and resilient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered Lacey as a teen. She\u0027d always been a little different from h er peers. On the surface she seemed like a typical high-school kid - she dat ed, though she had no serious crushes, played soccer and field hockey with abandon - but on holidays and family gatherings, she\u0027d stay in the backgrou nd. Joe would make a point of sitting down with her; he\u0027d draw her out, an d then another Lacey would emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Lacey was a thinker, a questioner. She had doubts about religio n, about government. She burned with an iconoclastic fire that urged her to question traditions and break with them whenever possible. She was fas cinated by the old anarchists and dug up all their works. He remembered h er favorite was No Treason by someone named Lysander Spooner. Instead of hanging posters of the latest teenage heartthrob boy band in her room, La cey had pictures of Emma Goldman and Madelyn Murray O\u0027Hare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe\u0027s sister and her husband tolerated her views with a mixture of humor and apprehension. If this was the shape and scope of Lacey\u0027s teenage rebellion, t hey\u0027d live with it. It was just a phase, they\u0027d say. She\u0027ll grow out of it. Better than drunk driving or drugs or getting pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t a phase. It was Lacey. And later, when she came out as a lesbi an, they turned their backs on her. Joe had tried to talk them out of slammi ng the family door, but this was more than they could take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who taught you to shoot?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend.\" She smiled. \"A guy friend, believe it or not. It was a self-defens e thing. He took me out to the range until I got comfortable with pulling the trigger. I\u0027m not a great shot, but if you\u0027re within ten feet of me and you\u0027re looking for trouble, you\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe had to smile. \"Never let it be said you\u0027re not full of surprises, Lacey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly. \"No one\u0027s ever said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned back to scrubbing the altar. They\u0027d been at it for over an hour n ow. Joe was drenched with sweat and figured he smelled like a bear, but he co uldn\u0027t stop until it was clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wouldn\u0027t come clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they do to this altar?\" Lacey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. This crud ... it seems part of the marble now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undead must have done something to the blood and foulness to make the mixture seep into the surface as it had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s take a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned sat on the floor with his back against the altar and rested. He did n\u0027t like resting because it gave him time to think. And when he started to th ink he realized that the odds were pretty high against his seeing tomorrow mo rning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he\u0027d die well fed. Their secret supplier had left them a dinner of fresh fried chicken by the front doors. Even the memory of it made his mou th water. Apparently someone was really glad he was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey settled next to him. She\u0027d shed her leather jacket hours ago. Her bare arms were sheened with perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That talk about Custer\u0027s last stand and the Alamo,\" she said. \"You\u0027re not pl anning to die here, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo tell the truth, as miserable as he\u0027d been, he wasn\u0027t ready to die. Not tonig ht, not any night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I can help it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Because as much as I can appreciate self-immolating gestures, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ready to take part in a Jersey Shore version of the Alamo or Litt le Big Horn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the cry of \u0027Remember the Alamo!\u0027 did spur a lot of people to action, but I agree. Going down fighting here will not solve anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the plan? We should have some sort of plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. Did he have a plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I want to do is hold off the undead till dawn. Keep them out of St. Ant hony\u0027s for one night. That\u0027s all. That will be a statement - my statement. Our statement if you want to stay on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if he found an opportunity to ram a stake through Palmeri\u0027s rotten heart, so much the better. But he wasn\u0027t counting on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Lacey said. \"One night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One night. Just to let them know they can\u0027t have their way everywhere with everybody whenever they feel like it. We\u0027ve got surprise on our side tonig ht, so maybe it will work.\" One night. Then he\u0027d be on his way. \"You should n\u0027t feel you have to stay just because you\u0027re my niece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t. But if I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked up at the shout. A burly, long-haired man in jeans and a cutaway denim jacket stood in the vestibule staring at the partially restored nave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he approached, Joe noticed his crescent moon earring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Vichy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe balled his fists but didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m talking to you, asshole. Are you responsible for this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen all he got from Joe was a cold stare, he turned to Zev and fixed on hi s yarmulke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you! Jew! What the hell you think you\u0027re doing here?\" He started to ward Zev. \"You get those fucking crosses off - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch him and I\u0027ll break you in half,\" Joe said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vichy skidded to a halt and stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy? Do you know what Father Palmeri will do to you when he g ets here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Palmeri? Why do you still call him that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what he wants to be called. And he\u0027s going to call you dog meat when he gets through with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe pulled himself to his feet and looked down at the Vichy. Suddenly the m an didn\u0027t seem so sure of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I\u0027ll be waiting.\" Joe gave him a hard, two-handed shove against hi s chest that sent him stumbling back. Damn, that felt good. \"Tell him Father Cahill is back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a priest? You don\u0027t look like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe slapped him across the face. Hard. It snapped the creep\u0027s chin toward his shoulder. That felt even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up and listen. Tell him Father Joe Cahill is back - and he\u0027s pissed. Tel l him that.\" Another chest shove. \"Now get out of here while you still can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing his cheek, the man backpedaled and hurried out into the growing da rkness. Joe turned to Zev and found him grinning through his beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Father Joe Cahill is back - and he\u0027s pissed.\u0027 I like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll make a great bumper sticker,\" Lacey said, her eyes wide with admira tion. \"You were great! I never knew my uncle the priest was such a tough d ude. Maybe we\u0027ve got more than a prayer tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe didn\u0027t know about that. He hoped so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll close the front doors,\" he said. \"The criminal element is startin g to wander in. While I\u0027m doing that, see if we can find some more candles. It\u0027s getting dark in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the front steps he unhooked the left door and closed it. He was unhooki ng the right when he heard a woman\u0027s voice behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Cahill? Is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and in the dying light saw a lone figure standing by a children\u0027s r ed wagon at the bottom of the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Do I know you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard her sob. \"Oh, it is you! You\u0027ve come back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe hurried down to the sobbing woman. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been praying for your return but I\u0027m such a sinner I thought God had t urned his back on us all. But you\u0027re back! Thank God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething familiar about her voice . .. but she kept her head down. Joe reach ed out, and tilted her chin so he could see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gasped when he saw her tear-stained face. He barely recognized her. Her skin was pale, her cheeks sunken, but he knew her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister Carole!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpulsively he threw his arms around her and pulled her against him in a hug. He wanted to laugh but feared if he opened his mouth he\u0027d burst out crying. Sweet emotions roiled through him, making him weak. She was here, she was alive. He wanted to tell her how he\u0027d missed her - missed knowing she was in the neighboring building, missed seeing her walk back and fort h to the school, missed the smile she would flash him whenever they cross ed paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so good to see you, Carole!\" He pushed her back and looked at her, ho ping to see that smile. But her eyes were different, haunted. \"Dear God, wh at\u0027s happened to you?\" Immediately he thought: Stupid question. The same th ing that\u0027s happened to us all. \"Why are you here? I thought you\u0027d gone to Pennsylvania for Easter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I had to stay behind ... with Sister Bernadette ... they ... I had to . . .\" She loosed a single, agonized sob. \"How could I stay in the convent after that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe wasn\u0027t following. Her speech was so disjointed. This wasn\u0027t like Carole. He\u0027d always known her as a woman of quiet intelligence, with a sharp, org anized mind. Everyone left alive had suffered, but what had she experienced to leave her so shattered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. \"Here and there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re staying here now.\" He took her arm. \"Come inside. We\u0027ve got-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve too many sins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all sinners, Carole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But these are terrible sins. Mortal sins. So many mortal sins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where sins are forgiven. I\u0027m going to try to say mass later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mass?\" Her lip quivered. \"Oh, that would be wonderful. But I can\u0027t. Even though it\u0027s a Holy Day, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What Holy - ?\" And then he remembered. With all that had been going on, it had slipped his mind. \"Oh, God, it\u0027s Ascension Thursday, isn\u0027t it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Carole nodded. \"But I\u0027ll just have to add missing Mass on a Holy Day of Obligation to my list of sins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come inside, Carole. Please. I\u0027ll hear your confession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She paused, as if she were listening for something. \"To receive absol ution I must be sorry for my sins and promise to sin no more.\" She shook he r head and something flashed in her eyes, something hard and dangerous. \"I\u0027m not. And I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe stared at her, trying to fathom . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t follow you, Carole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t, Father. It\u0027s not a path you want to tread.\" She bent and grabb ed the handle of her little red wagon, then turned and started away. \"God ble ss you, Father Cahill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe hurried after her. He couldn\u0027t let her go. It was too dangerous, but more than that, he wanted her near, where he could talk to her, be with her. He g rabbed her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t let you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched her arm free and kept moving. \"You can\u0027t make me stay. Don\u0027t t ry. I won\u0027t. I can\u0027t.\" The last word was couched in a sob that damn near br oke his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carole, please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she hurried on into the shadows without looking back. Joe started afte r her again, then stopped. Short of picking her up and carrying her back t o the church - and he couldn\u0027t see himself doing that - what could he do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly weary, he turned and climbed the steps. As he finished closing the f ront doors, he took one last longing look at the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarole . .. what\u0027s happened to you? Please be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the door and wished the lock hadn\u0027t been smashed. He turned and found Lacey and Zev standing in the vestibule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were getting worried about you,\" Lacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ran into one of the nuns who used to teach in St. Anthony\u0027s school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev\u0027s eyebrows arched. \"And you didn\u0027t let her in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t come in. But she reminded me that this is a Holy Day: Ascension Thursday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev shrugged. \"Which means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supposedly,\" Lacey said, \"forty days after Easter, Jesus ascended into Hea ven to sit at the right hand of God.\" She smiled. \"An ingenious way to dodg e all those inconvenient questions about the state and whereabouts of the r emains of the \u0027Son of God.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked at her. \"Lacey, you can\u0027t still be an atheist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I never really was. I call myself that because it\u0027s such an i n-your-face term. Like dyke. But atheism implies that you consider the quest ion of a provident god important enough to take seriously. I don\u0027t. At heart I\u0027m simply a devout agnostic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe was glad Carl wasn\u0027t here to hear this. He wouldn\u0027t understand or apprec iate Lacey\u0027s outspokenness. But that was Lacey. No excuses, no sugar coating: Here I am, here\u0027s what I think, take it or leave it. Through the years she\u0027d made him angry at times, but then she\u0027d smile and he\u0027d see his sister Cat hy in her face and his anger would fade away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the gold crucifix hanging from her neck. \"But you wear a cros s. Didn\u0027t you once tell me you\u0027d die before wearing anything like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I damn near did die because I wasn\u0027t wearing one. So now I wear one for per fectly pragmatic reasons. I\u0027ve never been one for fashion accessories, but i f it chases vampires, I want one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve got to take the next step, Lacey. You\u0027ve got to ask why the undea d fear it, why it sears their flesh. There\u0027s something there. When you face t hat reality, you won\u0027t be an atheist or agnostic anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey smiled. \"Did I mention I\u0027m a devout empiricist too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a worm, she wiggles,\" Zev said. \"Too many philosophy courses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey turned to him. \"That\u0027s not exactly a mezuzah hanging from your neck, rabbi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Zev said, fingering his cross. \"Like you, I wear it because it wo rks. That is undeniable. Where its power comes from, I don\u0027t know. Maybe fr om God, maybe from somewhere else. The how and the why I\u0027ll figure out late r. I\u0027ve been too busy trying to stay alive to give it my full attention.\" He held up his hands. \"Talk of intangibles we should save for the daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we should ready ourselves. I believe we\u0027ll soon have uninvited and unsa vory company. We should be prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking unhappy, Zev wandered away. But Joe didn\u0027t want to let this drop. Hesensed a chance to break through his niece\u0027s wall of disbelief. By doing so he might save her soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his voice. \"If the power of the cross is not from God, Lacy, the n who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might not be a who,\" she said with a shrug. \"Might be a what. I don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m just going with it for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027There are none so blind as those who will not see,\u0027 \" Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not blindness to not see something that won\u0027t show itself. Where\u0027s y our god now?\" She jutted her chin at Zev\u0027s retreating figure. \"His god and yours - where\u0027s he been? This is Ascension Thursday, right? Think about tha t. Maybe Jesus ascended and kept on going. Turned his back on this planet and forgot about it. After the way he was treated here, who could blame him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe shook his head, feeling a growing anger mixed with dismay. He hated to he ar his niece talk like this. \"Are you still an anarchist too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn betcha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well now, it looks like you\u0027ve got what you wanted - a world without rel igion, without government, without law - what do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe could tell by the set of her jaw and the flash of fire in her eyes that he\u0027d struck a nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not at all what I was talking about! This undead empire is more r epressive than any regime in human history. It makes Nazi Germany and Stal inist Russia look like Sunday school!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027re here to stay,\" Joe said, wondering if all today\u0027s plans and prepar ations weren\u0027t an exercise in futility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered where Palmeri was and how long before he got here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePALMERI . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore the night like a tuxedo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in a fresh cassock, Father Alberto Palmeri turned off County Line Roa d and strolled toward St. Anthony\u0027s. He loved the night, felt at one with it, attuned to its harmonies and its discords. The darkness made him feel so ali ve. Strange to have to lose your life before you could really feel alive. But this was it. He\u0027d found his niche, his me\u0027tier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a shame it had taken him so long. All those years trying to deny his ap petites, trying to be a member of the other side, cursing himself when he al lowed his appetites to win, as he had with increasing frequency toward the e nd of his mortal life. He should have given in to them long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken undeath to free him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to think he had been afraid of undeath, had cowered in fear that night i n the cellar of the church, surrounded by crosses. But he had not been as sa fe as he\u0027d thought. A posse of Serfs had torn him from his hiding place and brought him to kneel before Gregor. He\u0027d cried out and begged with this unde ad master to spare his life. Fortunately Gregor had ignored his pleas. All h e had lost by that encounter was his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in trade, he\u0027d gained a world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now it was his world, at least this little corner of it, one in which he was completely free to indulge himself in any way he wished. Except for the b lood. He had no choice about the blood. That was a new appetite, stronger tha n all the rest, one that would not be denied. But he did not mind the new app etite in the least. He\u0027d found interesting ways to sate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead he spotted dear, defiled St. Anthony\u0027s. He wondered what the serfs had prepared for tonight. They were quite imaginative. They\u0027d yet to bore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he drew nearer the church, Palmeri slowed. His skin prickled. The b uilding had changed. Something was very wrong there, wrong inside. Somethi ng amiss with the light that beamed from the windows. This wasn\u0027t the old familiar candlelight, this was something else, something more. Something t hat made his insides tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigures raced up the street toward him. Live ones. His night vision picked o ut the earrings and familiar faces of some of the serfs. As they neared he s ensed the warmth of the blood coursing just beneath their skins. The hunger rose in him and he fought the urge to rip into their throats. He couldn\u0027t al low himself that pleasure. Gregor had told him how to keep the servants dang ling, keep them working for him and the nest. They all needed the services o f the indentured living to remove whatever obstacles the cattle might put in their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday, when he was allowed to have get of his own, he would turn some of these, and then they\u0027d be bound to him in a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father! Father!\" they cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved it when they called him Father, loved being one of the undead and dressing like one of the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my children. What sort of victim do you have for us tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No victim, father - trouble!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edges of Palmeri\u0027s vision darkened with rage as he heard of the young p riest and the Jew and the others who had dared to try to turn St. Anthony\u0027s into a holy place again. When he heard the name of the priest, he nearly e xploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cahill? Joseph Cahill is back in my church?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was cleaning the altar!\" one of the servants said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri strode toward the church with the serfs trailing behind. He knew th at neither Cahill nor the Pope himself could clean that altar. Palmeri had desecrated it himself; he had learned how to do that when he became leader of Gregor\u0027s local get. But what else had the young pup dared to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever it was, it would be undone. Now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri strode up the steps and pulled the right door open -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- and screamed in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light! The light! The LIGHT! White agony lanced through Palmeri\u0027s eyes and seared his brain like two hot pokers. He retched and threw his arms a cross his face as he staggered back into the cool, comforting darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a few minutes for the pain to drain off, for the nausea to pass, for visi on to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never understand it. He\u0027d spent his entire life in the presence of cross es and crucifixes, surrounded by them. And yet as soon as he\u0027d become undead he was unable to bear the sight of one. In fact, since he\u0027d become undead he\u0027d never even seen one. A cross was no longer an object. It was a light, a lig ht so excruciatingly bright, so blazingly white that looking at it was sheer agony. As a child in Naples he\u0027d been told by his mother not to look at the s un, but when there\u0027d been talk of an eclipse, he\u0027d stared directly into its e ye. The pain of looking at a cross was a hundred, no, a thousand times worse than that. And the bigger the cross or crucifix, the worse the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d experienced monumental pain upon looking into St. Anthony\u0027s tonight. That could only mean that Joseph, that young bastard, had refurbished the gi ant crucifix. It was the only possible explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung on his servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in there! Get that crucifix down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got guns!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then get help. But get it down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get guns too! We can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I want him! I want that priest alive! I want him for myself! Anyone who kills him will suffer a very painful, very long and lingering true death! Is that clear? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear. They scurried away without answering. Palmeri went to gather the other members of the nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOE . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in a cassock and a surplice, Joe came out of the sacristy and approa ched the altar. He noticed Zev keeping watch at one of the windows. He didn\u0027t tell him how ridiculous he looked carrying the shotgun Carl had brought ba ck. He held it so gingerly, as if it was full of nitroglycerin and would exp lode if he jiggled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev turned and smiled when he saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you look like the old Father Joe we all used to know,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe gave him a little bow and proceeded toward the altar. Lacey waved with her revolver from the other side of the nave where she stood guard by the s ide door. She\u0027d put on her black leather jacket and looked ready for anythi ng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right: He had everything he needed. He had the Missal they\u0027d found in a mong the pew debris earlier today. He had the wine - Carl had brought back ab out four ounces of sour red babarone. He\u0027d found the smudged surplice and d usty cassock on the floor of one of the closets in the sacristy, and he wor e them now. No hosts, though. A crust of bread left over from breakfast wou ld have to do. No chalice, either. If he\u0027d known he was going to be saying Mass he\u0027d have come prepared. As a last resort he\u0027d used the can opener in the rectory to remove the top of one of the Pepsi cans from lunch. Quite a stretch from the gold chalice he\u0027d used since his ordination, but probably more in line with what Jesus had used at that first Mass - the Last Supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was uncomfortable with the idea of weapons in St. Anthony\u0027s but saw no alternative. He and Zev knew nothing about guns, and Carl knew little more; they\u0027d probably do more damage to themselves than to the Vichy if they t ried to use them. Only Lacey seemed at ease with her pistol. Joe hoped tha t just the sight of the weaponry might make the Vichy hesitate, slow them down. All he needed was a little time here, enough to get to the consecrat ion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to be the most unusual Mass in history, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was going to get through it if it killed him. And that was a real pos sibility. This might well be his last Mass. But he wasn\u0027t afraid. He was too excited to be afraid. He\u0027d had a slug of the Scotch - just enough to ward off the shakes - but it had done nothing to quell the buzz of the adrenaline humm ing along every nerve in his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spread everything out on the white tablecloth he\u0027d taken from the rectory and used to cover the filthy altar. He looked at Carl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl nodded and stuck the automatic pistol he\u0027d been examining into his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been awhile, Fadda. We did it in Latin when I was a kid, but I think I can s wing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do your best and don\u0027t worry about any mistakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome Mass. A defiled altar, a crust for a host, a Pepsi can for a chalice, a s ixty-year-old, pistol-packing altar boy, and a congregation consisting of a le sbian atheist and a rabbi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked heavenward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou do understand, don\u0027t you, Lord, that all this was arranged on short notic e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read the Gospel but dispensed with the homily. He tried to remember the Ma ss as it used to be said, to fit in better with Carl\u0027s outdated responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he was starting the Offertory the front doors flew open and a group of men entered - ten of them, all with crescent moons dangling from their ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of his eye he saw Zev move away from the window toward the altar, pointing his shotgun at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they entered the nave and got past the broken pews, the Vichy fa nned out toward the sides. They began pulling down the Stations of the Cros s, ripping Carl\u0027s makeshift crosses from the walls and tearing them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl looked up at Joe from where he knelt, his eyes questioning, his hand reac hing for the pistol in his belt. Lacey didn\u0027t look at him at all. She acted on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop right there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her pistol straight out before her, arms rigid. Joe saw the barrel wobble. She might be tough, he thought, but she\u0027s only twenty-five. And she\u0027s only got two rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Vichy didn\u0027t know that. They stopped their forward progress and trie d to stare her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t get all of us,\" one said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev worked the pump on the shotgun. The sound echoed through the church. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right. She can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded a lot tougher than Joe knew he was. He hoped the Vichy were f ooled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they were. They looked at each other but didn\u0027t back off. A stand-of f was good enough for now. Joe nodded and kept up with the Offertory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he caught a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye. One of th e Vichy had ducked through the side door behind Lacey. He carried a raised two-by-four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lacey!\" Zev cried. \"Behind - !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled, ducking, pistol raised, but the Vichy had the jump on her. Th e two-by-four glanced off the side of her head and slammed into her forear m. She dropped the gun and went down. But not before landing a vicious kic k on the inside of his knee. He staggered back, howling with pain while La cey, cradling her injured arm, jumped up and scrambled toward the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vichy cheered and went on with their work. They split - one group conti nuing to pull down Carl\u0027s crosses, the other swarming around and behind t he altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe chanced a quick glance over his shoulder and saw them begin their attac k on the newly repaired crucifix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zev!\" Carl said in a low voice, cocking his head toward the Vichy. \"Stop e m!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m warning you,\" Zev said and pointed the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe heard the activity behind him come to a sudden halt. He braced himself for the blast. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it never came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Zev. The old man met his gaze and sadly shook his head. He co uldn\u0027t do it. To the accompaniment of the sound of renewed activity and de risive laughter behind him, Joe gave Zev a tiny nod of reassurance and und erstanding, then hurried the Mass toward the Consecration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he held the crust of bread aloft, he started at the sound of the life-size crucifix crashing to the floor, cringed as he heard the freshly buttressed arm s and crosspiece being torn away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he held the wine aloft in the Pepsi can, the swaggering, grinning Vichy surrounded the altar and brazenly tore the cross from around his neck. Zev, Lacey, and Carl put up struggles to keep theirs but were overpowered. The Vichy wound up with Carl\u0027s gun too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Joe\u0027s skin began to crawl as a new group entered the nave. They n umbered about twenty, all undead. He faced them from behind the altar as t hey approached. His gut roiled at the familiar faces he spotted among the throng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the one who caught and held his attention was the one leading them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlberto Palmeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePALMERI . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri hid his hesitancy as he approached the altar. The crucifix and its intolerable whiteness were gone, yet something was not right. Something rep ellent here, something that urged him to flee. What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was just the residual effect of the crucifix and all the crosses th ey had used to line the walls. That had to be it. The unsettling aftertaste wo uld fade as the night wore on. Oh, yes. His nightbrothers and sisters from the nest would see to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused his attention on the man behind the altar and laughed when he re alized what he held in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pepsi, Joseph? You\u0027re trying to consecrate Pepsi?\" He turned to his nest s iblings. \"Do you see this, my brothers and sisters? Is this the man we are to fear? And look who he has with him! An old Jew, a young woman, and a par ish hanger-on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reveled in their hissing laughter as they fanned out around him, sweepi ng toward the altar in a wide phalanx. The young woman, the Jew, and Carl - he recognized Carl and wondered how he\u0027d avoided capture for so long - retre ated to the other side of the altar where they flanked Joseph. And Joseph. .. Joseph\u0027s handsome Irish face so pale and drawn, his mouth stretched i nto such a tight, grim line. He looked scared to death. As well he should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri put down his rage at Joseph\u0027s audacity. He was glad he had returne d. He\u0027d always hated the young priest for his easy manner with people, for the way the parishioners had flocked to him with their problems despite t he fact that he had nowhere near the experience of their older and wiser p astor. But that was over now. That world was gone, replaced by a nightworl d - Palmeri\u0027s world. And no one would be flocking to Father Joe for anything when Palmeri was through with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Joe... how he\u0027d hated it when the parishioners had started calling him that. Well, their Father Joe would provide superior entertainment tonigh t. This was going to be fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joseph, Joseph, Joseph,\" he said as he stopped and smiled at the young priest across the altar. \"This futile gesture is so typical of your arrogance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Joseph only stared back at him, his expression a mixture of defiance an d repugnance. And that only fueled Palmeri\u0027s rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I repel you, Joseph? Does my new form offend your precious shanty-Iri sh sensibilities? Does my undeath disgust you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You managed to do all that while you were still alive, Alberto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri allowed himself to smile. Joseph probably thought he was putting on a brave front, but the tremor in his voice betrayed his fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always good with the quick retort, weren\u0027t you, Joseph. Always thinking y ou were better than me, always putting yourself above me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much of a climb where a child molester is concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri\u0027s anger mounted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So superior. So self-righteous. What about your appetites, Joseph? The sec ret ones? What are they? Do you always hold them in check?\" He pointed to t he girl in the leather jacket. \"Is she your weakness, Joseph? Young, attrac tive in a hard sort of way. Is that your style? Do you like it rough? Are y ou fucking her, Joseph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave her out of this. She just showed up today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if not her, then who? Are you so far above the rest of us that you\u0027v e never given in to an improper impulse, never assuaged a secret hunger? Yo u\u0027ll have a new hunger soon, Joseph. By dawn you\u0027ll be drained - we\u0027ll each t ake a turn at you - and before the sun rises we\u0027ll hide your corpse from its light. You\u0027ll stay dead all day, but when the night comes you\u0027ll be one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped closer, almost touching the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then all the rules will be off. The night will be yours. You\u0027ll be free to do anything and everything you\u0027ve ever wanted. But blood will be your prim e hunger, and you\u0027ll do anything to get it. You won\u0027t be sipping your god\u0027s t hin, cold blood, as you\u0027ve done so often, but hot human blood. You\u0027ll thirst for it, Joseph. And I want to be there when you take your first drink. I want to be there to laugh in your self-righteous face as you suck up the crimson nectar, and keep on laughing every night as the red hunger carries you into i nfinity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it would happen. Palmeri knew it as sure as he felt his own thirst. He hungered for the moment when he could rub dear Joseph\u0027s face in the reality of his own bloodlust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just saying Mass,\" Joseph said coolly. \"Do you mind if I finish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri couldn\u0027t help laughing this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really think this charade would work? Did you really think you co uld celebrate Mass on this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out and snatched the tablecloth from the altar, sending the Missa l and the piece of bread to the floor and exposing the fouled surface of the marble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really think you could effect a transubstantiation here?

Something about the c an, something about the way he found it difficult to bring its outline into focus...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva, perhaps you should - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva\u0027s grin broadened. \"I\u0027ve always wanted to sup on the blood of a deity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nest members hissed their laughter as Eva raised the can and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri watched, unaccountably fearful as the liquid poured into her mout h. And then -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLIGHT!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn explosion of intolerable brightness burst from Eva\u0027s mouth and drove him back, jolted, cringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of her skull glowed beneath her scalp and shafts of pure white l ight shot from her ears, nose, eyes - every orifice in her head. The glow spr ead as it flowed down through her throat and chest and into her abdominal c avity, silhouetting her ribs before melting through her skin. Eva was lique fying where she stood, her flesh steaming, softening, running like glowing molten lava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! This couldn\u0027t be happening! Not now when he had Joseph in his grasp!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the can fell from Eva\u0027s dissolving fingers and landed on the altar top. I ts contents splashed across the fouled surface, releasing another detonation o f brilliance, this one more devastating than the first. The glare spread rapid ly, extending over the upper surface and running down the sides, moving like a living thing, engulfing the entire altar, making it glow like a corpuscle of fire torn from the heart of the sun itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with the light came blast-furnace heat that drove Palmeri back, back, ba ck until he had to turn and follow the rest of his nest in a mad, headlong r ush from St. Anthony\u0027s into the cool, welcoming safety of the outer darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZEV . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the undead fled into the night, their Vichy toadies behind them, Zev sta red in horrid fascination at the puddle of putrescence that was all that re mained of the undead woman Palmeri had called Eva. He glanced at Carl and Lacey and caught the look of dazed wonderment on their faces. Zev touched th e top of the altar - clean, shiny, every whorl of the marble surface clearly visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d witnessed fearsome power here. Incalculable power. But instead of elat ing him, the realization only depressed him. How long had this been going o n? Did it happen at every Mass? Why had he spent his entire life ignorant o f this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Joe. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A miracle!\" Carl said, running his palm over the altar top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A miracle and a meltdown,\" Lacey added from behind Zev.

Zev only vaguely remembered the old commerci als, but found himself roaring along with the other three. It was more a rel ease of tension than anything else. His sides hurt. He had to lean against t he altar to support himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t that funny,\" Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey smiled. \"No argument there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon,\" Carl said, heading for the sanctuary. \"Let\u0027s see if we can get this c rucifix back together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev helped Lacey slip her arm back into her jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You rest that arm,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced again and cradled it with her left. \"I don\u0027t think I have much cho ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev jumped at the sound of the church doors banging open.

His giant stature and rai sed fists cowed them for a few heartbeats. But then they must have remembe red that they outnumbered him twelve to one and charged.

Both went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev dropped to one knee and reached for the shotgun. He would use it this t ime, he would shoot these vermin, he swore it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then someone landed on his back and drove him to the floor. As he tried to get up he saw Carl pulling Lacey away toward the side door, and he saw Father Joe, surrounded, swinging his fists, laying the Vichy out every time he connected. But there were too many. As the priest went down under the p ress of them, a heavy boot thudded against the side of Zev\u0027s head. He sank into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOE . . .... a throbbing in his head, stinging pain in his cheek, and a voice, sibilant yet harsh . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... now, Joseph.

Think on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think an empty threat is going to cow me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find out how empty it is, won\u0027t we? But here\u0027s the deal: let Zev go and I\u0027ll let you be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You care that much for an old Jew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s something you never knew in life, and never will know: he\u0027s a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he gave me back my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri leaned closer. His foul, nauseating breath wafted against Joe\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend? How can you be friends with a dead man?\" With that he straigh tened and turned toward the balcony. \"Do him! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Joe shouted out frantic pleas and protests, one of the undead climbed up the rubble toward Zev. Zev did not struggle. Joe saw him close his eyes, w aiting. As the vampire reached out with the straight razor, Joe bit back a sob of grief and rage and helplessness. He was about to squeeze his own eye s shut when he saw a flame arc through the air from one of the windows. It struck the floor with a crash of glass and a wooomp! of exploding flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe had only heard of such things, but he immediately realized that he had just seen his first Molotov cocktail in action. The splattering gasoline splashed a nearby vampire who began running in circles, screaming as it be at at its flaming clothes. But its cries were drowned by the roar of other voices, a hundred or more. Joe looked around and saw people - men, women, t eenagers -\u0026nbsp; climbing in the windows, charging through the front doors. The w omen held crosses on high while the men wielded long wooden pikes - broom, r ake, and shovel handles whittled to sharp points. Joe recognized most of t he faces from the Sunday Masses he had said here for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSt. Anthony\u0027s parishioners were back to reclaim their church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" he shouted, not sure of v/hether to laugh or cry. But when he saw the rage in Palmeri\u0027s face, he laughed. \"Too bad, Alberto!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri made a lunge at his throat but cringed away as a woman with an up held crucifix and a man with a pike charged the altar - Lacey and Carl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Uncle Joe?\" Lacey said, her eyes wide and angry. \"Did they - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got here just in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled out a butterfly knife, flipped it open with one hand, and began sa wing at the rope around Joe\u0027s right wrist. She was using her left only; her r ight arm didn\u0027t seem to be of much use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told ya I wouldn\u0027t let ya down, didn\u0027t I, Fadda?\" Carl said, grinning. \"Didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you did, Carl. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been so glad to see anyone in m y entire life. But how - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We told \u0027em. We run through the parish, Lacey and me, goin house to house. We told \u0027em Fadda Joe was in trouble at the church and we let him down b efore but we shouldn\u0027t let him down again. He come back for us, now we got ta go back for him. Simple as that. And then they started runnin house to house, and afore ya knowed it, we had ourselfs a little army. We come to k ick ass, Fadda, if you\u0027ll excuse the expression.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kick all the ass you can, Carl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe glanced around and spotted a sixtyish black woman he recognized as Lilly Green. He saw her terror-glazed eyes as she swiveled around, looking this w ay and that; he saw how the crucifix trembled in her hand. She wasn\u0027t going to kick too much ass in her state, but she was here, God bless her, she was here for him and for St. Anthony\u0027s despite the terror that so obviously fill ed her. His heart swelled with love for these people and pride in their cour age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his arms were free, Joe sat up and took the knife from Lacey. He sawed at his leg ropes, looking around the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oldest and youngest members of the parishioner army were stationed at the windows and doors where they held crosses aloft, cutting off the vampi res\u0027 escape, while all across the nave - chaos. Screams, cries, and an occas ional shot echoed through St. Anthony\u0027s. The undead and their Vichy were o utnumbered three to one. The undead seemed blinded and confused by all the crosses around them. Despite their superhuman strength, it appeared that some were indeed getting their asses kicked. A number were already writhin g on the floor, impaled on pikes. As Joe watched, he saw the middle-aged Gonzales sisters, Maria and Immaculata, crucifixes held before them, backin g a vampire into a corner. As it cowered there with its arms across its face, Maria\u0027s husband Hector charged in with a sharpened rake handle held like a lance and ran it through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a number of parishioners lay in inert, bloody heaps on the floor, proof that the undead and the Vichy were claiming their share of victims too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe freed his feet and hopped off the altar. He looked around for Palmeri - he wanted Palmeri - but the undead priest had lost himself in the melee. Joe glanced up at the balcony and saw that Zev was still hanging there, struggl ing to free himself. He started across the nave to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZEV . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev hated that he should be hung up here like a chicken in a deli window. Hetried again to pull his upper body up far enough to reach his leg ropes b ut he couldn\u0027t get close. He had never been one for exercise; doing a sit-u p flat on the floor would have been difficult, so what made him think he co uld do the equivalent maneuver hanging upside down by his feet? He dropped back, exhausted, and felt the blood rush to his head again. His vision swam, his ears pounded, he felt as if the skin of his face might burst open. Mu ch more of this and he\u0027d have a stroke or worse maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the upside-down battle below and was glad to see the undead get ting the worst of it. These people - seeing Carl among them, Zev assumed the y were part of St. Anthony\u0027s parish - were ferocious, almost savage in their attacks on the undead. All their pent-up rage and fear was being released upon their tormentors in a single burst. It was almost frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he felt a hand on his foot. Someone was untying his knots. Thank y ou, Lord. Soon he would be on his feet again. As the cords came loose he de cided he should at least attempt to participate in his own rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, Zev thought. Once more I\u0027ll try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a grunt he levered himself up, straining, stretching to grasp somethin g, anything. A hand came out of the darkness and he reached for it. But Zev\u0027s relief turned to horror when he felt the cold clamminess of the thing th at clutched him, that pulled him up and over the balcony rail with inhuman strength. His bowels threatened to evacuate when Palmeri\u0027s grinning face lo omed not six inches from his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not over yet, Jew,\" he said softly, his foul breath clogging Zev\u0027s nose a nd throat. \"Not by a long shot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt Palmeri\u0027s free hand ram into his belly and grip his belt at the buckle, then the other hand grab a handful of his shirt at the neck. Before he could s truggle or cry out, he was lifted free of the floor and hoisted over the balcon y rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the dybbuk\u0027s voice was in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joseph called you a friend, Jew. Let\u0027s see if he really meant it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOE . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe was halfway across the floor of the nave when he heard Palmeri\u0027s voice echo above the madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop them, Joseph! Stop them now or I drop your friend!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked up and froze. Palmeri stood at the balcony rail, leaning over it, his eyes averted from the nave and all its newly arrived crosses. At the en d of his outstretched arms was Zev, suspended in mid-air over the splintered remains of the pews, over a particularly large and ragged spire of wood tha t pointed directly at the middle of Zev\u0027s back. Zev\u0027s frightened eyes were f lashing between Joe and the giant spike below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him Joe heard the sounds of the melee drop a notch, then drop anothe r as all eyes were drawn to the tableau on the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A human can die impaled on a wooden stake just as well as a vampire!\" Palmer i cried. \"And just as quickly if it goes through his heart. But it can take h ours of agony if it rips through his gut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSt. Anthony\u0027s grew silent as the fighting stopped and each faction backed awa y to a different side of the church, leaving Joe alone in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want, Alberto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First I want all those crosses put away so that I can see!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked to his right where his parishioners stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put them away,\" he told them. When a murmur of dissent arose, he added, \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t put them down, just out of sight. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, one by one at first, then in groups, the crosses and crucifixes were placed behind backs or tucked out of sight within coats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his left, the undead hissed their relief and the Vichy cheered. The sound was like hot needles being forced under Joe\u0027s fingernails. Above, Palmeri t urned his face to Joe and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" Joe asked, knowing with a sick crawling in his gut ex actly what the answer would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A trade,\" Palmeri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me for him, I suppose?\" Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri\u0027s smile broadened. \"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Joe! \"Zev cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri shook the old man roughly. Joe heard him say, \"Quiet, Jew, or I\u0027ll snap your spine!\" Then he looked down at Joe again. \"The other thing is to tell your rabble to let my people go.\" He laughed and shook Zev again. \"Hea r that, Jew? A Biblical reference - Old Testament, no less!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Joe said without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parishioners on his right gasped as one and cries of \"No!\" and \"You can\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003et!\" filled St. Anthony\u0027s. A particularly loud voice nearby shouted, \"He\u0027s on ly a lousy kike!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe wheeled on the man and recognized Gene Harrington, a carpenter. He jer ked a thumb back over his shoulder at the undead and their servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like you\u0027d be more at home with them, Gene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrington backed up a step and looked at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Father,\" he said in a voice that hovered on the verge of a sob. \"But we just got you back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be all right,\" Joe said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he meant it. Deep inside he had a feeling that he would come through thi s, that if he could trade himself for Zev and face Palmeri one-on-one, he co uld come out the victor, or at least battle him to a draw. Now that he was n o longer tied up like some sacrificial lamb, now that he was free, with full use of his arms and legs again, he could not imagine dying at the hands of the likes of Palmeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, one of the parishioners had given him a tiny crucifix. He had it clo sed in the palm of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had to get Zev out of danger first. That above all else. He looked up at Palmeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Alberto. I\u0027m on my way up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Palmeri said. \"Someone search him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe gritted his teeth as one of the Vichy, a blubbery, unwashed slob, came forward and searched his pockets. Joe thought he might get away with the cr ucifix but at the last moment he was made to open his hands. The Vichy grin ned in Joe\u0027s face as he snatched the tiny cross from his palm and shoved it into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s clean now!\" the slob said and gave Joe a shove toward the vestibule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe hesitated. He was walking into the snake pit unarmed. A glance at his p arishioners told him he couldn\u0027t very well turn back now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued on his way, clenching and unclenching his tense, sweaty fists as he walked. He still had a chance of coming out of this alive. He was too angry to die. He prayed that when he got within reach of the ex-priest the smoldering rage at how he had framed him when he\u0027d been pastor, at what he\u0027d done to St. Anthony\u0027s since then, would explode and give him the strengt h to tear Palmeri to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Zev shouted from above. \"Forget about me! You\u0027ve started something h ere and you\u0027ve got to see it through!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe ignored his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming, Alberto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Joe\u0027s coming, Alberto. And he\u0027s pissed. Royally pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZEV . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev craned his neck, watching Joe disappear beneath the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joe! Comeback!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmeri shook him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it up, old Jew. Joseph never listened to anyone and he\u0027s not listening to you. He still believes in faith and virtue and honesty, in the power of go odness and truth over what he perceives as evil. He\u0027ll come up here ready to sacrifice himself for you, yet sure in his heart that he\u0027s going to win in th e end. But he\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Zev said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in his heart he knew that Palmeri was right. How could Joe stand up again st a creature with Palmeri\u0027s strength, who could hold Zev in the air like thi s for so long? Didn\u0027t his arms ever tire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Palmeri hissed. \"He\u0027s going to lose and we\u0027re going to win. We\u0027ll w in for the same reason we always win. We don\u0027t let anything as silly and t ransient as sentiment stand in our way. If we\u0027d been winning below and sit uations were reversed - if Joseph were holding one of my nest brothers over that wooden spike below - do you think I\u0027d pause for a moment? For a second?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever! That\u0027s why this whole exercise by Joseph and these people is futil e.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFutile. . . Zev thought. Like much of his life, it seemed. Like all of his fut ure. Joe would die tonight and Zev might live on ... as what? A cross-wearing Jew, with the traditions of his past sacked and in flames, and nothing in his future but a vast, empty, limitless plain to wander alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootfalls sounded on the balcony stairs and Palmeri turned his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,Joseph,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev couldn\u0027t see the priest but he shouted anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back, Joe! Don\u0027t let him trick you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of tricks,\" Palmeri said, leaning further over the balcony rail as a n extra warning to Joe, \"I hope you\u0027re not going to try anything foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Joe\u0027s tired voice from somewhere behind Palmeri. \"No tricks. Pul l him in and let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZev could not let this happen. And suddenly he knew what he had to do. He t wisted his body and grabbed the front of Palmeri\u0027s cassock while bringing h is legs up and bracing his feet against one of the uprights of the brass ba lcony rail. As Palmeri turned his startled face toward him, Zev put all his strength into his legs for one convulsive backward push against the railin g, pulling Palmeri with him. The undead priest was overbalanced. Even his e normous strength could not help him once his feet came free of the floor. Zev saw his undead eyes widen with terror when his lower body slipped over t he railing. As they fell free, Zev wrapped his arms around Palmeri and clut ched his cold and surprisingly thin body tight against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What goes through this old Jew goes through you!\" he shouted into the vamp ire\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant he saw Joe\u0027s horrified face appear over the balcony\u0027s recedi ng edge, heard his faraway shout of \"No!\" mingle with Palmeri\u0027s nearer, len gthier scream of the same word, then came a spine-cracking jar and in his c hest a tearing, wrenching pain beyond all comprehension. In an eyeblink he felt the sharp spire of wood rip through him and into Palmeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he felt no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs roaring blackness closed in he wondered if he\u0027d done it, if this last des perate, foolish act had succeeded. He didn\u0027t want to die without finding out. He wanted to know -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he knew no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOE . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe shouted incoherently as he hung over the rail and watched Zev\u0027s fall, g agged as he saw the bloody point of the pew remnant burst through the back of Palmeri\u0027s cassock directly below him. He saw Palmeri squirm and flop aro und like a beached fish, then go limp atop Zev\u0027s already inert form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs cheers mixed with cries of horror and the sounds of renewed battle rose from the nave, Joe turned away from the balcony rail and dropped to his kne es.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zev!\" he cried aloud. \"Good God, Zev!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing himself to his feet, he stumbled down the back stairs, through the v estibule, and into the nave. The undead and the Vichy were on the run, as co wed and demoralized by their leader\u0027s death as the parishioners were buoyed by it. Slowly, steadily, they were falling before the relentless onslaught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Joe paid them scant attention. He fought his way to where Zev lay impale d beneath Palmeri\u0027s already decomposing corpse. He looked for a sign of life in his old friend\u0027s glazing eyes, a hint of a pulse in his throat under his beard, but found nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zev, Zev, Zev, you shouldn\u0027t have. You shouldn\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened as he felt a pair of arms go around him, then saw it was Lace y. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she leaned against him and sobbed. Sh e reached out and touched Zev\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Uncle Joe... Uncle Joe...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly they were surrounded by a cheering throng of St. Anthony\u0027s parish ioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did it, Fadda Joe!\" Carl cried, his face and hands splattered with blood. \"We killed \u0027em all! We got our church back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks to this man here,\" Joe said, pointing to Zev.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" someone shouted. \"Thanks to you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmid the cheers, Joe shook his head and said nothing. Let them celebrate. Th ey deserved it. They\u0027d reclaimed a tiny piece of the world as their own, a t oehold and nothing more. A small victory of minimal significance in the war, but a victory nonetheless. They had their church back, at least for tonight. And they intended to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. But there would be one change. If they wanted their Father Joe to sti ck around they were going to have to agree to rename the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSt. Zev\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe liked the sound of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGREGOR . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wrong, wasn\u0027t I!\" Olivia raged, waving her arms and she stormed back and forth across the main floor of the Post office. Her get-guards flanked her, watching the windows, trying to cover her as she moved. Gregor\u0027s guar ds clustered near him, warily watching the others. \"Yesterday, when I heard that more than one of your serfs had been killed in a single night, I thou ght it couldn\u0027t get any worse. But now this! This!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor, still too numb with shock, said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and his guards had been on the other side of town, roaming the streets, h unting the vigilantes, when he\u0027d heard the news. He\u0027d rushed back to the chu rch, not believing it could be true. But it was. He\u0027d found St. Anthony\u0027s af lame with searing light, too bright to look at. Crosses blazed from every wi ndow and door, the corpses of his cowboys and his get lay in a tangled pile on the front steps, and from within ... the voices of the cattle raised in h ymns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia stopped her pacing and glared at him. \"You allowed this to happen, di dn\u0027t you, Gregor. You\u0027re trying to humiliate me, aren\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bitch!\" Gregor shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his fist and took a step toward her. Her guards reacted by reaching for their machetes, and Gregor\u0027s guards followed suit. As much as he wanted his hands around her throat, crushing it, twisting until her head ripped free, this was not the time or place for a pointless melee. Gregor opened his fis t and stabbed a finger at Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You conniving, self-centered bitch! Humiliate you? I\u0027m the one whose local get has been virtually wiped out! If anyone\u0027s pride has been damaged tonig ht it is mine!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve nobody to blame but yourself,\" she snarled. \"Your serfs and your get failed you, failed all of us. They deserved what they got. I see only o ne solution. I will have to bring in my own serfs and get to clean up your m ess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what you\u0027ve wanted all along, isn\u0027t it. For all I know you engineered this yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk like a fool! I - \" She stopped, held up a hand, and closed her e yes. \"Wait. Wait.\" She opened her eyes and stared at him. \"Do you see what is happening? A few of the cattle make a move against us and what do we d o? We turn on each other. This is not the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing she was right, Gregor stepped back. But he said nothing. The stin g of her words remained. His get had not deserved to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a situation,\" Olivia said. \"One that must be kept quiet and crushed immediately. If word of what happened here tonight gets around, insurrectio ns like this could spread like wildfire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor watched her. He didn\u0027t trust this suddenly reasonable Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing to do is retake the church,\" he said. \"Immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can\u0027t, Gregor. The slow attrition of your serfs to these vigilantes o ver the past weeks plus their wholesale slaughter tonight leaves us short of manpower. Of the ones we have left, half are ready to bolt. We\u0027d better hope these vigilantes are so happy to have their church back that they\u0027ll stay the re tomorrow, because we now have barely enough serfs to guard us during the s unlit hours. If these vigilantes should decide to put together a hunting part y...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor suppressed a shudder. \"They won\u0027t. They\u0027re not the vigilantes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You so dearly wish. Then the blame would not be on you for allowing them to roam free for so long. In fact, as I remember, you were supposed to sol ve the vigilante problem before this coming sunrise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she have to bring that up? He\u0027d been searching since sundown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems we\u0027ve had a slight, unanticipated distraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved her hand, brushing him off. \"Unlike you, I am not going to sit on my hands. I\u0027ve already contacted Franco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word bitch rose to Gregor\u0027s lips again but he bit it back. Pointless to ca ll names now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you gave him a scrupulously evenhanded account of the night\u0027s eve nts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered him a tight smile. \"Certainly. I requested a detachment of ferals and a group of tough, seasoned serfs. The plan is simple: tomorrow night the y will firebomb the church and let the parishioners run out into the arms of the ferals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor had to admit it was a good plan: simple, direct. It would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did Franco say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile faltered. \"He said he\u0027d take it under consideration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor\u0027s mind reeled in shock. Franco is hanging me out to dry! Is this what I get for my loyalty, my efforts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he telling us to clean up our own mess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia\u0027s eyebrows shot up. \"Our mess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Olivia. You were here when it happened. No matter how you spin it to Franco, he\u0027s still going to see it as our mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor didn\u0027t know if that was true, but it didn\u0027t hurt to make Olivia squirm, get her working with him instead of against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vigilantes were your problem long before I arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m telling you these are not the same people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very self-serving theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their methods are different. I\u0027ve been gathering information since it happ ened. One of my cowboys - serfs - walked in on them in the church earlier today. They didn\u0027t kill him, just pushed him around and sent him on his way. If it had been the vigilantes they would have slit his throat and hung him fro m a pole just like all the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they\u0027ve changed tactics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregor shook his head. \"The church problem was started by a priest and a ra bbi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working together? Maybe this is more of a problem than I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. But these two are not the vigilantes. They\u0027re worse. They\u0027re visible, a nd they\u0027ve provided a base of operations, a rallying point for the cattle. They\u0027re doing everything the vigilantes did not do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will not get you off the hook, Gregor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you listen to me? I\u0027m trying to tell you there are two groups to deal w ith now, separate and distinct. And if they should band together we will be i n even bigger danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said, Gregor: theory. A theory needs proof. If you\u0027re so convinced the vigilantes are not in that church, then prove it by finding them and bringi ng them in. I hope you succeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find that hard to believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m quite serious. Your serfs are becoming afraid to move about in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sense a foundering ship and, like the rats they are, they\u0027re ready to jump. We can\u0027t have that. We need them to hold the day. If these people take back the day, then we might lose the night as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat will never happen, Gregor thought. I will not allow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will bring in these vigilantes as promised. And when I do, I\u0027ll bleed them -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust enough to weaken them. Then I\u0027ll give them to the cowboys to finish. I\u0027ll let them take as long as they like to exact their revenge. And then they\u0027ll s ee that we take care of our helpers. And the rest of the cattle will see that resistance is futile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to succeed, had to prove that the vigilantes were not connected with the church rebels, otherwise the blame for the fall of the church would rest on his shoulders. His whole future depended on finding those damn vigilante s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hope so,\" Olivia said. \"Meanwhile, I won\u0027t be idle while waiting to h ear from Franco. I\u0027m going to have that church watched closely in case this priest or rabbi or anyone else from inside steps out.\" Her eyes blazed. \"I w ant one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" Gregor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For answers. For leverage. For.. . fun.\" Olivia smiled. \"I can be very invent ive.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/midnight-mass/page-4.html","bookId":2552,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:30:25 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:30:25 AM"}
