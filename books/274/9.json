I now come to certain other of my verses, which according to them are amatory; but so vilely and coarsely did they read them as to leave no impression save one of disgust. Now what has it to do with the malpractices of the black art, if I write poems in praise of the boys of my friend Scribonius Laetus? Does the mere fact of my being a poet make me a wizard? Who ever heard any orator produce such likely ground for suspicion, such apt conjectures, such close-reasoned argument? ‘Apuleius has written verses!’ If they are bad, that is something against him as a poet, but not as a philosopher. If they are good, why do you accuse him? ‘But they were frivolous verses of an erotic character.’ So that is the charge you bring against me? and it was a mere slip of the tongue when you indicted me for practising the black art?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet many others have written such verse, although you may be ignorant of the fact. Among the Greeks, for instance, there was a certain Teian, there was a Lacedaemonian, a Cean, and countless others; there was even a woman, a Lesbian, who wrote with such grace and such passion that the sweetness of her song makes us forgive the impropriety of her words; among our own poets there were Aedituus, Porcius, and Catulus, with countless others. ‘But they were not philosophers.’ Will you then deny that Solon was a serious man and a philosopher? Yet he is the author of that most wanton verse:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLonging for your thighs and your sweet mouth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat is there so lascivious in all my verses compared with that one line? I will say nothing of the writings of Diogenes the Cynic, of Zeno the founder of Stoicism, and many other similar instances. Let me recite my own verses afresh, that my opponents may realize that I am not ashamed of them:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCritias my treasure is and you,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003elight of my life, Charinus, too\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ehold in my love-tormented heart\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eyour own inalienable part.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAh!
