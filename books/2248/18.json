In any case, the bowling center wasn\u0027t the place for that kind of exchange of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered bringing it up after closing when she dragged him into her home office to show him the new chart Layla had generated that listed the time, place, approximate duration, and involved parties in all known incidents since Quinn\u0027s arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forgot about it when he was in bed with her, when she was moving with him, when everything felt right again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he told himself it was too late to bring it up, to give the topics the proper time when she was curled up warm with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was avoidance, but he opted for the likelihood it was just his tendency to prefer things at the right time, in the right place. He\u0027d arranged to take Sunday off so the entire group could hike to the Pagan Stone. That, to his mind, was the right time and place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Nature screwed with his plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen forecasters began to predict an oncoming blizzard, he kept a jaundiced eye on the reports. They were, in his experience, wrong at least as often as they were right. Even when the first flakes began to fall midmorning, he remained unconvinced. It was the third blizzard hype of the year, and so far the biggest storm had dumped a reasonable eight inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged it off when the afternoon leagues canceled. It had gotten so people canceled everything at the first half inch, then went to war over bread and toilet paper in the supermarket. And since the powers-that-be canceled school before noon, the arcade and the grill were buzzing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when his father came in about two in the afternoon, looking like Sasquatch, Cal paid more attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re going to close up shop,\" Jim said in his easy way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that bad. The arcade\u0027s drawing the usual suspects, the grill\u0027s been busy. We\u0027ve had some lanes booked. A lot of towners will come in later in the afternoon, looking for something to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bad enough, and it\u0027s getting worse.\" Jim shoved his gloves in the pocket of his parka. \"We\u0027ll have a foot by sundown the way it\u0027s going. We need to send these kids home, haul them there if they don\u0027t live within easy walking distance. We\u0027ll close up, then you go on home, too. Or you get your dog and Gage and come on over and stay with us. Your mother\u0027ll worry sick if she thinks you\u0027re out driving in this at night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to remind his father that he was thirty, had four-wheel drive, and had been driving nearly half his life. Knowing it was pointless, Cal just nodded. \"We\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027ve got plenty of supplies. I\u0027ll clear out the customers, close up, Dad. You go on home. She\u0027ll worry about you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s time enough to close down and lock up.\" Jim glanced over at the lanes where a six-pack of teenagers sent off energy and hormones in equal measure. \"Had a hell of a storm when I was a kid. Your grandfather kept her open. We stayed here for three days. Time of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet.\" Cal grinned. \"Want to call Mom, say we\u0027re stuck? You and me can ride it out. Have a bowling marathon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned if I wouldn\u0027t.\" The lines around Jim\u0027s eyes crinkled at the idea. \"Of course, she\u0027ll kick my ass for it and it\u0027d be the last time I bowled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better shut down then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough there were protests and moans, they moved customers along, arranging for rides when necessary with some of the staff. In the silence, Cal shut down the grill himself. He knew his father had gone back to check with Bill Turner. Not just to give instructions, he thought, but to make sure Bill had whatever he needed, to slip him a little extra cash if he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he shut down, Cal pulled out his phone and called Fox\u0027s office. \"Hey. Wondered if I\u0027d catch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just. I\u0027m closing. Already sent Mrs. H home. It\u0027s getting bad out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Head over to my place. If this comes in like they\u0027re whining about, it might be a couple days before the roads are clear. No point wasting them. And maybe you should stop, pick up, you know, toilet paper, bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toilet...You\u0027re bringing the women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He\u0027d made up his mind on that when he\u0027d taken a look outside. \"Get...stuff. Figure it out. I\u0027ll be home as soon as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked off, then shut down the alley lights as his father came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything set?\" Cal asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way his father looked around the darkened alley told Cal he was thinking they weren\u0027t just going to lose their big Friday night, but likely the entire weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll make it up, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. We always do.\" He gave Cal a slap on the shoulder. \"Let\u0027s get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUINN WAS LAUGHING WHEN SHE OPENED THE door. \"Isn\u0027t this great! They say we could get three feet, maybe more! Cyb\u0027s making goulash, and Layla went out and picked up extra batteries and candles in case we lose power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Great.\" Cal stomped snow off his boots. \"Pack it up and whatever else you all need. We\u0027re going to my place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly. We\u0027re fine. You can stay, and we\u0027ll-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs clear of snow as he could manage, he stepped in, shut the door behind him. \"I have a small gas generator that\u0027ll run little things-such as the well, which means water to flush the toilets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Toilets. I hadn\u0027t thought of that one. But how are we all going to fit in your truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll manage. Get your stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took them half an hour, but he\u0027d expected that. In the end, the bed of his truck was loaded with enough for a week\u0027s trek through the wilderness. And three women were jammed with him in the cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should\u0027ve had Fox swing by, get one of them, he realized. Then Fox could\u0027ve hauled half the contents of their house in his truck. And it was too late now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gorgeous.\" Layla perched on Quinn\u0027s lap, bracing a hand on the dash while the Chevy\u0027s windshield wipers worked overtime to clear the snow from the glass. \"I know it\u0027s going to be a big mess, but it\u0027s so beautiful, so different than it is in the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember that when we\u0027re competing for bathroom time with three men,\" Cybil warned her. \"And let me say right now, I refuse to be responsible for all meals just because I know how to turn on the stove.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So noted,\" Cal muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is gorgeous,\" Quinn agreed, shifting her head from side to side to see around Layla. \"Oh, I forgot. I heard from my grandmother. She tracked down the Bible. She\u0027s having her sister-in-law\u0027s granddaughter copy and scan the appropriate pages, and e-mail them to me.\" Quinn wiggled to try for more room. \"At least that\u0027s the plan, as the granddaughter\u0027s the only one of them who understands how to scan and attach files. E-mail and online poker\u0027s as far as Grandma goes on the Internet. I hope to have the information by tomorrow. Isn\u0027t this great?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWedged between Quinn\u0027s butt and the door, Cybil dug in to protect her corner of the seat. \"It\u0027d be better if you\u0027d move your ass over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got Layla\u0027s space, too, so I get more room. I want popcorn,\" Quinn decided. \"Doesn\u0027t all this snow make everyone want popcorn? Did we pack any? Do you have any?\" she asked Cal. \"Maybe we could stop and buy some Orville\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his mouth shut, and concentrated on surviving what he thought might be the longest drive of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plowed his way down the side roads, and though he trusted the truck and his own driving, was relieved when he turned onto his lane. As he\u0027d been outvoted about the heat setting, the cab of the truck was like a sauna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven under the circumstances, Cal had to admit his place, his woods, did look like a picture. The snow-banked terraces, the white-decked trees and huddles of shrubs framed the house where smoke was pumping from the chimney, and the lights were already gleaming against the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed the tracks of Fox\u0027s tires across the little bridge over his snow-and ice-crusted curve of the creek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLump padded toward the house from the direction of the winter-postcard woods, leaving deep prints behind him. His tail swished once as he let out a single, hollow bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, look at Lump.\" Quinn managed to poke Cal with her elbow as the truck shoved its way along the lane. \"He\u0027s positively frisky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snow gets him going.\" Cal pulled behind Fox\u0027s truck, smirked at the Ferrari, slowly being buried, then laid on the horn. He\u0027d be damned if he was going to haul the bulk of what three women deemed impossible to live without for a night or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged bags out of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a beautiful spot, Cal.\" Layla took the first out of his hands. \"Currier and Ives for the twenty-first century. Is it all right if I go right in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty as a picture.\" Cybil scanned the bags and boxes, chose one for herself. \"Especially if you don\u0027t mind being isolated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over as Gage and Fox came out of the house. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind crowds either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got everything inside, trailing snow everywhere. Cal decided it must have been some sort of female telepathy that divided them all into chores without discussion. Layla asked him for rags or old towels and proceeded to mop up the wet, Cybil took over the kitchen with her stew pot and bag of kitchen ingredients. And Quinn dug into his linen closet, such as it was, and began assigning beds, and ordering various bags carried to various rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t anything for him to do, really, but have a beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGage strode in as Cal poked at the fire. \"There are bottles of girl stuff all over both bathrooms up there.\" Gage jerked a thumb at the ceiling. \"What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What had to be done. I couldn\u0027t leave them. They could\u0027ve been cut off for a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what, turned into the next Donner Party? Your woman has Fox making my bed, which is now the pullout in your office. And which I\u0027m apparently supposed to share with him. You know that son of a bitch is a bed hog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t be helped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy for you to say, seeing as you\u0027ll be sharing yours with the blonde.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Cal grinned, smugly. \"Can\u0027t be helped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Esmerelda\u0027s brewing up something in the kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goulash-and it\u0027s Cybil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever, it smells good, I\u0027ll give her that. She smells better. But the point is I got the heave-ho when I tried to get a damn bag of chips to go with the beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to cook for six people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGage only grunted, sat, propped his feet on the coffee table. \"How much are they calling for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About three feet.\" Cal dropped down beside him, mirrored his pose. \"Used to be we liked nothing better. No school, haul out the sleds. Snowball wars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those were the days, my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we\u0027re priming the generator, loading in firewood, buying extra batteries and toilet paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sucks to be grown up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it was warm, and while the snow fell in sheets outside, there was light, and there was food. It was hard to complain, Cal decided, when he was digging into a bowl of hot, spicy stew he had nothing to do with preparing. Plus, there were dumplings, and he was weak when it came to dumplings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in Budapest not that long ago.\" Gage spooned up goulash as he studied Cybil. \"This is as good as any I got there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, this isn\u0027t Hungarian goulash. It\u0027s a Serbo-Croatian base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn good stew,\" Fox commented, \"wherever it\u0027s based.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cybil\u0027s an Eastern European stew herself.\" Quinn savored the half dumpling she\u0027d allowed herself. \"Croatian, Ukrainian, Polish-with a dash of French for fashion sense and snottiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did your family come over?\" Cal wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As early as the seventeen hundreds, as late as just before World War Two, depending on the line.\" But she understood the reason for the question. \"I don\u0027t know if there is a connection to Quinn or Layla, or any of this, where it might root from. I\u0027m looking into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a connection,\" Quinn said, \"straight off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal understood that kind of friendship, the kind he saw when the two women looked at each other. It had little to do with blood, and everything to do with the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We hooked up the first day-evening really-of college.\" Quinn spooned off another minuscule piece of dumpling with the stew. \"Met in the hall of the dorm. We were across from each other. Within two days, we\u0027d switched. Our respective roommates didn\u0027t care. We bunked together right through college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And apparently still are,\" Cybil commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember you read my palm that first night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You read palms?\" Fox asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the mood strikes. My gypsy heritage,\" Cybil added with a flourishing gesture of her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Cal felt a knot form in his belly. \"There were gypsies in the Hollow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Carefully, Cybil lifted her wineglass, sipped. \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have to check to be sure. This is from stories my gran told me that her grandmother told her. Like that. About how gypsies came one summer and set up camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting. Potentially,\" Quinn mused, \"someone local could get cozy with one of those dark-eyed beauties or hunks, and nine months later, oops. Could lead right to you, Cyb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one big, happy family,\" Cybil muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the meal, chores were divvied up again. Wood needed to be brought in, the dog let out, the table cleared, dishes dealt with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else cooks?\" Cybil demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gage does,\" Cal and Fox said together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Cybil sized him up. \"If there\u0027s a group breakfast on the slate, you\u0027re in charge. Now-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before we...whatever,\" Cal decided, \"there\u0027s something we have to go over. Might as well stick to the dining room. We have to get something,\" he added, looking at Fox and Gage. \"You might want to open another bottle of wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s all this?\" Quinn frowned as the men retreated. \"What are they up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more what haven\u0027t they told us,\" Layla said. \"Guilt and reluctance, that\u0027s what I\u0027m picking up. Not that I know any of them that well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what you know,\" Cybil told her. \"Get another bottle, Q.\" She gave a little shudder. \"Maybe we should light a couple more candles while we\u0027re at it, just in case. It already feels...dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY LEFT IT TO HIM, CAL SUPPOSED, BECAUSE IT was his house. When they were all back around the table, he tried to find the best way to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve gone over what happened that night in the clearing when we were kids, and what started happening after. Quinn, you got some of it yourself when we hiked there a couple weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Cyb and Layla need to see it, as soon as the snow\u0027s cleared enough for us to make the hike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated only a beat. \"Agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t a stroll down the Champs \u0026amp;Eacute;lys¨¦es,\" Gage commented, and Cybil cocked an eyebrow at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was another element that night, another aspect we haven\u0027t talked about with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With anyone,\" Fox added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to explain why. We were ten, everything went to hell, and...Well.\" Cal set his part of the stone on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A piece of rock?\" Layla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloodstone.\" Cybil pursed her lips, started to reach for it, stopped. \"May I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGage and Fox set theirs down beside Cal\u0027s. \"Take your pick,\" Gage invited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three parts of one.\" Quinn picked up the one closest to her. \"Isn\u0027t that right? These are three parts of one stone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One that had been rounded, tumbled, polished,\" Cybil continued. \"Where did you get the pieces?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were holding them,\" Cal told her. \"After the light, after the dark, when the ground stopped shaking, each one of us was holding his part of this stone.\" He studied his own hand, remembering how his fist had clenched around the stone as if his life depended on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t know what they were. Fox looked it up. His mother had books on rocks and crystals, and he looked it up. Bloodstone,\" Cal repeated. \"It fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It needs to be put back together,\" Layla said. \"Doesn\u0027t it? It needs to be whole again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve tried. The breaks are clean,\" Fox explained. \"They fit together like a puzzle.\" He gestured, and Cal took the pieces, fit them into a round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it doesn\u0027t do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re holding them together?\" Curious, Quinn held out her hand until Cal put the three pieces into it. \"They\u0027re not...fused would be the word, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tried that, too. MacGyver over there tried superglue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal sent Gage a bland stare. \"Which should\u0027ve worked-at least as far as holding the pieces together. But I might as well have used water. No stick. We\u0027ve tried banding them, heating them, freezing them. No dice. In fact, they don\u0027t even change temperature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except-\" Fox broke off, got the go-ahead nod. \"During the Seven, they heat up. Not too hot to hold, but right on the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you tried putting them back together during that week?\" Quinn demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. No luck. The one thing we know is that Giles Dent was wearing this, like an amulet around his neck, the night Lazarus Twisse led that mob into the clearing. I saw it. Now we have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you tried magickal means?\" Cybil asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal squirmed a little, cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Cal, loosen up.\" Fox shook his head. \"Sure. I got some books on spells, and we gave that a try. Down the road, Gage has talked to some practicing witches, and we\u0027ve tried other rites and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you never showed them to anyone.\" Quinn set the pieces down carefully before picking up her wine. \"Anyone who might have been able to work with them, or understand the purpose. Maybe the history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t meant to.\" Fox lifted his shoulders. \"I know how it sounds, but I knew we weren\u0027t supposed to take it to, what, a geologist or some Wiccan high priestess, or the damn Pentagon. I just...Cal voted for the science angle right off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacGyver,\" Gage repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fox was sure that was off-limits, and that was good enough. That was good enough for the three of us.\" Cal looked at his friends. \"It\u0027s been the way we\u0027ve handled it, up till now. If Fox felt we shouldn\u0027t show you, we wouldn\u0027t be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you feel it the strongest?\" Layla asked Fox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe. I know I believed-I believe-we survived that night, that we came out of it the way we came out of it because we each had a piece of that stone. And as long as we do, we\u0027ve got a chance. It\u0027s just something I know, the same way Cal saw it, that he recognized it as the amulet Dent wore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about you?\" Cybil asked Gage. \"What do you know? What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes met hers. \"I see it whole, on top of the Pagan Stone. The stone on the stone. And the flames flick up from it, kindling in the blood spots. Then they consume it, ride over the flat, down the pedestal like a sheath of fire. I see the fire race across the ground, fly into the trees until they burst from the heat. And the clearing\u0027s a holocaust even the devil himself couldn\u0027t survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a drink of wine. \"That\u0027s what I see when it\u0027s whole again, so I\u0027m in no big hurry to get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s how it was formed,\" Layla began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see back. That\u0027s Cal\u0027s gig. I see what might be coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be handy in your profession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGage shifted his gaze back to Cybil, smiled slowly. \"It doesn\u0027t hurt.\" He picked up his stone, tossed it lightly in his hand. \"Anyone interested in a little five-card draw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he spoke, the light snapped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than romance or charm, the flickering candles they\u0027d lit as backup lent an eeriness to the room. \"I\u0027ll go fire up the generator.\" Cal pushed up. \"Water, refrigerator, and stove for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go out alone.\" Layla blinked as if surprised the words had come out of her mouth. \"I mean-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Fox rose, something howled in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lump.\" Cal was out of the room, through the kitchen, and out the back door like a bullet. He barely broke stride to grab the flashlight off the wall, punch it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swept it toward the sound. The beam struggled against the thick, moving curtain of snow, did little but bounce the light back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blanket had become a wall that rose past his knees. Calling his dog, Cal pushed through it, trying to pinpoint the direction of the howling. It seemed to come from everywhere, from nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he heard sounds behind him, he whirled, gripping the flashlight like a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t clock the reinforcements,\" Fox shouted. \"Christ, it\u0027s insane out here.\" He gripped Cal\u0027s arm as Gage moved to Cal\u0027s other side. \"Hey, Lump! Come on, Lump! I\u0027ve never heard him like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know it\u0027s the dog?\" Gage asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back inside,\" Cal said grimly. \"We can\u0027t leave the women alone. I\u0027m going to find my dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, we\u0027ll just leave you out here, stumbling around in a fucking blizzard.\" Gage jammed his freezing hands in his pockets, glanced back. \"Besides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came, arms linked and gripping flashlights. Which showed sense, Cal was forced to admit. And they\u0027d taken the time to put on coats, probably boots as well, which is more than he or his friends had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back in.\" He had to shout now, over the rising wind. \"We\u0027re just going to round up Lump. Be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all go in or nobody does.\" Quinn unhooked her arm from Layla\u0027s, hooked it to Cal\u0027s. \"That includes Lump. Don\u0027t waste time,\" she said before he could argue. \"We should spread out, shouldn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In pairs. Fox, you and Layla try that way, Quinn and I\u0027ll take this way. Gage and Cybil toward the back. He\u0027s got to be close. He never goes far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded scared, that\u0027s what Cal didn\u0027t want to say out loud. His stupid, lazy dog sounded scared. \"Hook your hand in my pants-the waistband. Keep a good hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hissed against the cold as her gloves hit his skin, then began to trudge forward. He\u0027d barely made it two feet when he heard something under the howls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You catch that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Laughing. The way a nasty little boy might laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving that dog out here any more than you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vicious gush of wind rose up like a tidal wave, spewing huge clumps of snow, and what felt like pellets of ice. Cal heard branches cracking, like gunfire in the dark. Behind him, Quinn lost her footing in the force of the wind and nearly took them both down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d get Quinn back into the house, he decided. Get her the hell in, lock her in a damn closet if necessary, then come back out and find his dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he turned to get a grip on her arm, he saw them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dog sat on his haunches, half buried in the snow, his head lifted as those long, desperate howls worked his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy floated an inch above the surface of the snow. Chortling, Cal thought. There was a word you didn\u0027t use every day, but it sure as hell fit the filthy sound it made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grinned as the wind blasted again. Now Lump was buried to his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the fuck away from my dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal lurched forward; the wind knocked him back so that both he and Quinn went sprawling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call him,\" Quinn shouted. \"Call him, make him come!\" She dragged off her gloves as she spoke. Using her fingers to form a circle between her lips, she whistled shrilly as Cal yelled at Lump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLump quivered; the thing laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal continued to call, to curse now, to crawl while the snow flew into his eyes, numbed his hands. He heard shouting behind him, but he focused everything he had on pushing ahead, on getting there before the next gust of wind put the dog under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d drown, Cal thought as he pushed, shoved, slid forward. If he didn\u0027t get to Lump, his dog would drown in that ocean of snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a hand lock on his ankle, but kept dragging himself forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting his teeth, he flailed out, got a slippery hold on Lump\u0027s collar. Braced, he looked up into eyes that glittered an unholy green rimmed with red. \"You can\u0027t have him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal yanked. Ignoring Lump\u0027s yelp, he yanked again, viciously, desperately. Though Lump howled, whimpered, it was as if his body was sunk in hardened cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Quinn was beside him, belly down, digging at the snow with her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox skidded down, shooting snow like shrapnel. Cal gathered everything he had, looked once more into those monstrous eyes in the face of a young boy. \"I said you can\u0027t have him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the next pull, Cal\u0027s arms were full of quivering, whimpering dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, it\u0027s okay.\" He pressed his face against cold, wet fur. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him in by the fire.\" Layla struggled to help Quinn up as Cybil pushed up from her knees. Shoving the butt of a flashlight in his back pocket, Gage pulled Cybil to her feet, then plucked Quinn out of the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you walk?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah. Let\u0027s get in, let\u0027s get inside, before somebody ends up with frostbite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowels and blankets, dry clothes, hot coffee. Brandy-even for Lump-warmed chilled bones and numbed flesh. Fresh logs had the fire blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was holding him. He couldn\u0027t get away.\" Cal sat on the floor, the dog\u0027s head in his lap. \"He couldn\u0027t get away. It was going to bury him in the snow. A stupid, harmless dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has this happened before?\" Quinn asked him. \"Has it gone after animals this way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few weeks before the Seven, animals might drown, or there\u0027s more roadkill. Sometimes pets turn mean. But not like this. This was-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A demonstration.\" Cybil tucked the blanket more securely around Quinn\u0027s feet. \"He wanted us to see what he could do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe wanted to see what we could do,\" Gage countered, and earned a speculative glance from Cybil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be more accurate. That may be more to the point. Could we break the hold? A dog\u0027s not a person, has to be easier to control. No offense, Cal, but your dog\u0027s brainpower isn\u0027t as high as most toddlers\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, affectionately, Cal pulled on one of Lump\u0027s floppy ears. \"He\u0027s thick as a brick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was showing off. It hurt this poor dog for sport.\" Layla knelt down and stroked Lump\u0027s side. \"That deserves some payback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntrigued, Quinn cocked her head. \"What do you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know yet, but it\u0027s something to think about.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1/page-18.html","bookId":2248,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:44 PM"}
