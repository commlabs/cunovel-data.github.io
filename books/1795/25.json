Probably recognized it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The fact that you are having coffee with me is no one’s business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wasn’t just coffee,” Rafe said as she went past him into the living room. “But who’s going to argue?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was saved from having to respond because she was already halfway to the front door. She patted Winston, who looked like a ballet dancer, poised and ready on his paws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, pal. I don’t think a burglar would arrive in a Volvo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door. A polished, good-looking man emerged from behind the wheel of the Volvo. He wore a navy blue polo shirt, a pair of gray trousers, and loafers. There was a designer logo stitched on the left side of the shirt. The pants appeared to have been hand-tailored, and the loafers had little tassels. She was almost certain that the hair had been styled in a salon located somewhere other than Eclipse Bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her visitor spotted her waiting in the doorway, he gave her a dazzling smile that lit up the foggy morning like a lighthouse beacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like Perry has started bleaching his teeth,” she murmured to Winston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinston rumbled deep in his throat and trotted after her as she went out onto the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hannah.” Perry Decatur jogged toward the steps. “Heard you were in town. Great to see you again. You look fabulous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the last minute she realized his intention and braced herself. He swept her into an embrace that would have been more appropriate for lovers who had been separated for years by war and star-crossed fates. She felt the breath go out of her lungs as his arms closed around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low growl reverberated across the porch. For one horrible moment, Hannah was not sure if the sound had come from Winston or Rafe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cute dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry released Hannah, bent down, and thumped Winston lightly on his broad, intelligent head without going through the civilized formality of allowing Winston to sniff his fingers first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinston’s silvery brows bristled with indignation, but he was too well behaved to make a scene. He did, however, display a discreet glimpse of fang. Could have been an accident, Hannah thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry straightened quickly. “Dogs love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No kidding.” Hannah looked at Winston. “Thank you, Winston. I can handle this. You may go back inside and finish your breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a last glare at Perry, Winston turned and stalked back into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine-looking animal,” Perry said approvingly. “Do you show him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Show him what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant, is he a show dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. “Put Winston in a ring and make him perform stunts for a bunch of judges? Are you mad? I wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing. He would be mortified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry managed a forced chuckle. “I see. Well, how have you been, Hannah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. That’s just great.” He angled his chin in the general direction of Rafe’s car. “I see you’ve got a visitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re having coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coffee sounds terrific.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chose to ignore the unsubtle hint. “I’m a little busy, Perry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright light of his smile dimmed a bit. “Hannah, I really need to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call me this afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This can’t wait.” Perry paused a beat and lowered his voice. “It’s important. Not just to me but to a lot of people here in Eclipse Bay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wavered. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too involved to explain out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved past her with a breezy arrogance that made her want to stick out a foot and trip him. She avoided the temptation. If Winston was capable of good manners and restraint in the face of extreme provocation, she could do no less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went thoughtfully back into the house and closed the door. Perry was already in the kitchen, introducing himself to Rafe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think we’ve met.” He thrust out his hand. “I’m Perry Decatur. I’m with the institute. Sorry to interrupt breakfast. Hannah and I are old friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rafe Madison.” Rafe kept his fingers wrapped around his coffee mug and managed to overlook Perry’s outstretched hand. “I know all about your old friendship with Hannah. I was the one who walked her home that night eight years ago when she decided to end her date with you a little early. But I’m sure you heard all about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry blinked a couple of times and dropped his hand. But if he found the moment awkward, he gave no hint. “What a coincidence, the three of us getting together over coffee after all this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, life’s funny that way, isn’t it?” The gleam in Rafe’s eyes was diamond-hard. “So, what do you do at the think tank?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vice President of Finance and Administration.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry removed a small gold case from his pocket and produced a card. When Rafe did not reach for it, he put it down on the table next to the empty syrup jug. He took one of the chairs, twitched it around, and sat down back to front. Very confident. Very much at home in this house. Hannah ground her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m the guy who deals with the donors and contributors who fund the research projects,” Perry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In other words, you hustle cash for the institute,” Rafe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah raised her eyes toward the ceiling, but there was no help from that quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Perry was insulted by Rafe’s description of his job, he managed to conceal it behind a small chuckle. “It’s a bit more complicated than that, but I really don’t have time to go into it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah dropped down into her chair. “Why don’t you tell me exactly why you’re here, Perry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’d like to invite you to attend the reception for Trevor Thornley at the institute tomorrow night,” Perry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Hannah said, “but I’m not big on political receptions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is an important event,” Perry said seriously. “Thornley’s going to formally announce his intention to enter the U.S. Senate race.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry pursed his lips. “Well, the thing is, when I heard that you were back in town, I more or less assured the director of the institute that I could convince you to come to the reception. It would look very good to have a Harte there, if you know what I mean. Your family has always carried a lot of weight here in Eclipse Bay.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-25.html","bookId":1795,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM"}
