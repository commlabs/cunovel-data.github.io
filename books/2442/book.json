He runs into a pack of wolves, Streak and Rudi - the two wolves he knew from an earlier encounter. These wolves help him make his way back to Vampire Mountain safely. He must find a way to inform the Vampire Princes (the leaders of the vampires) of Kurda\u0027s treachery before they crown him a fellow Prince. Kurda\u0027s treason includes hiding Vampaneze inside the mountain, preparing to murder the Princes and attempting to gain control of the Stone of Blood (a powerful stone that can be used to locate any vampire who has touched it) with which he would force the vampires to join the Vampaneze and become a single clan once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vampire-prince-the-saga-of-darren-shan-6.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-prince-the-saga-of-darren-shan-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:41 PM"}
