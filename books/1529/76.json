But she had no strength. She slid down the rope, too fast. The caustic acid of her skin flared in the shaft\u0027s direct sunlight, triggering some chemical reaction in the synthetic rope. It smoked and melted as she slid along it. Susan twirled as she plummeted, almost in free fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one dared catch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray swung to the side and dragged the cloth tarp from the stone face. He whipped one end to Kowalski. His partner understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, the rope snapped, burned through where Susan had grabbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped in a limp, boneless fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray and his partner caught her, but her weight still ripped the tarp from their hands and she struck the floor hard. Using the tarp, Gray swung her out of direct sight, only her legs visible from above. He dropped beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser screamed down to them. On hands and knees. His cheek still smoked, flesh blackened. His bare arms looked like seared steak, weeping and bleeding. \"I want that bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stumbled back into view. \"Neck\u0027s broken! She\u0027s dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA war of emotions played across Nasser\u0027s face. It settled on a near-mindless rage. \"Then you\u0027ll all burn!\" He rolled back. \"Blow it all up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray waved to everyone. \"Back .. . out of sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa obeyed, stumbling from the light and into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few bullets sparked, chasing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stared toward the rigged explosives. The electronic detonator was beyond their reach, out in the open. They would be shot if they dared approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray dragged the tarp, hauling Susan\u0027s limp form. \"Behind the foundation pillars! They may offer some protection. Crouch low, find anything to cover your head and face!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey scattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour pillars, six of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray took Susan with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa found herself huddled with the monsignor behind one of the sandstone pillars. He pulled her down, shielding her with his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa placed her palm on the pillar. It was three feet across. She had no idea of the strength of the blast to come. She turned to Vigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father, will this protect us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stared down at her face and didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once Lisa wished a priest would lie to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gateway to Hell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 7, 11:17 a.m. Angkor Thom, Cambodia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray cradled Susan, keeping her wrapped in the tarp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned and stirred. She had taken a good crack to the head when she struck the ground, but Gray had lied to Nasser about her neck being broken. The bastard, in his agony, had not questioned it, maybe had even hoped for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had hoped to use the woman\u0027s body as a bargaining chip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was not going well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp above, Nasser shouted, maddened by the pain. From the look of his blackened skin, he had sustained third-degree burns across large swaths of his body. And now he wanted them to suffer in kind. An eye for an eye. But apparently the demolition team hadn\u0027t been prepared for such a sudden order. They were scrambling, giving Gray\u0027s party a minute or so of a reprieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking advantage of it, Gray shifted Susan\u0027s weight, seeking to better protect her behind the pillar. If she was the potential cure, she had to be preserved. He tugged the tarp more thoroughly over her head. It parted briefly, revealing the soft glow of her naked skin beneath. Away from the bright sunlight, the sheen to her skin had begun to dim. He paused for a beat, amazed at the strangeness. As he drew the drape closed again, he noted the wall ahead of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scrollwork of angelic script shone with an exceptional brilliance, fluorescing under the weak glow. The light emanating from the cyanobacteria in her skin must shed wavelengths in the ultraviolet range, igniting a fluorescent compound etched into the carvings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminded Gray of the Egyptian obelisk, glowing with angelic script, a miniature and rudimentary version of this display. Had Johannes Trithemius had deeper revelations during his meditations? A vision of all this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray opened the tarp wider, casting a broader beam of her glow. More of the script ignited, swirling off through the darkness in either direction, as if he had set flame to oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sat higher. He noted a spot of darkness off to the far left, barely discernible, at the edge of the glow\u0027s reach, a dark rock in the shining stream of glowing script. The angularity of it caught his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould that be. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned Susan in his arms, letting more of the tarp fall away, keeping enough between the woman\u0027s skin and his own. The glow was still not strong enough to reach that far. He had to move Susan closer. He struggled with her weight, tangling the tarp, sensing the seconds ticking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kowalski! Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice answered out from the pillar to his right. \"I\u0027m hiding! Like you said to!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hauled up. \"I need you over here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the bomb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about the bomb. Get your ass over here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski swore sharply, then headed over, grumbling under his breath. \"Why is it always a goddamn bomb . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large man ran up to him, practically sliding behind the pillar, like he was stealing from third to home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray motioned with his chin to the left. \"Help me move Susan down that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski sighed heavily. Using the tarp like a stretcher, they slung her form between them and rushed off along the wall. As they hurried, the curve of script ignited along with them, brightening as they neared, fading again after they passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan had been hiding behind the next pillar. She crossed toward them, drawn by the brilliant display and their frantic actions. \"What are you—oh my God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lowered Susan to the floor, keeping her uncovered, basking her glow on the wall, setting fire to the script. All except for a recognizable patch of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vigor!\" Gray called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming!\" he answered. Plainly the monsignor had seen the sight all the way across the chamber. Gray heard the double tramp of steps as Lisa trailed Vigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all stood before the wall, gaping at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot at what was glowing—but what wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friar Agreer,\" Vigor said. \"He must have left this marker, by washing down the wall. Cleaned the patch here as a sign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sign of what?\" Seichan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A clue to a hidden doorway,\" Gray said. \"There must be another way down to the cavern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does the clue mean?\" Vigor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shook his head, knowing they were running out of time. If they didn\u0027t find the door, get Susan somewhere safe and away from the Guild, it wasn\u0027t just their lives. According to Lisa, a pandemic was already spreading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser called down to them. \"Say your last prayers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ!\" Kowalski blurted out, though it wasn\u0027t meant as a prayer. He knocked Gray and Vigor aside, crossed to the wall, and shoved hard in the center of the cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone door swiveled on a central pivot, revealing a passage beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski turned. \"It\u0027s not always rocket science, guys. Sometimes a door is just a door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey piled through the exit. Gray and Kowalski again slung Susan between them. Once through, Seichan and Lisa shouldered the door back closed behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, a stairway led down, cut out of the limestone bedrock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one doubted where it led.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they started down, a muffled explosion echoed to them, a single boom of thunder. Gray sent a silent prayer of thanks to Friar Agreer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had saved Marco in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he had saved all their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough relieved, Gray could still not escape a horrible dread. While he might be free, his parents were not. When Nasser found his prisoners gone, Gray knew who would be made to suffer for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI2:l8 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated on the warehouse rooftop, Harriet drowsed in her husband\u0027s arms. It was a warm evening. Overhead, the moon moved imperceptibly across the night sky. Despite the terror, exhaustion had taken its toll. For the first hour, she had listened to the ebb and flow of shouts and barks. Then she stopped caring. Time stretched, long enough that Harriet was startled to find herself dozing when the first shout rose from the other side of the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re here,\" Jack said, sounding almost relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted and motioned for Harriet to retreat inside the hollowed out HVAC unit behind them. There was barely room for two. Once Harriet was inside, she held out her hand toward her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he collected the door grate from the tar paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack?\" she whispered out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the grate between them, pushing it in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No . . .\" she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips were at the grate\u0027s slats as he snugged it closed over her. \"Please, Harriet, let me do this. I can lead them away. Buy you more time. Give me at least this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes met through the thin slats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood. For too long, Jack had believed himself only half a man. He didn\u0027t intend to die that way. But to Harriet, Jack had never been half a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she could not take this from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her last gift to him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached her fingers through the slats, tears streaming. His fingers touched hers, thanking her, loving her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts drew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had no more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned and half crawled over to the roof\u0027s raised wall, his pistol clutched in a fist. When he reached the wall, he used its support to hobble away to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet tried to follow where he went, but he was soon out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covered her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp cry of discovery rose in that direction. She heard the retort of a pistol blast, coming from closer to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet counted his shots, knowing he only had the three rounds left in his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturn fire strafed her husband\u0027s position, pinging off metal. Jack must have found some cover. Another shot blasted from his spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne bullet left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the ringing lull of the brief firefight, Jack called out. \"You\u0027ll never find my wife. I hid her beyond your goddamn reach.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-76.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
