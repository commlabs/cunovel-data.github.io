{"id":29108,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\"Good morning!\" The voice was cheery, insistent. It brought the young girl on the porch above to the white wooden rail about its edge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good morning!\" she called back lightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beautiful day!\" persisted the young man saying inanely the first words he could think of for the sole purpose of keeping her there in sight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lovely!\" cried the girl enthusiastically, leaning a little further over the rail. A vine, which had climbed the round pillar and twined its tendrils about the porch\u0027s edge, set waving by the slight motion, sent a shower of scarlet leaves about the young man below; one fluttered upon his breast, he caught it and held it over his heart as if it were a message from her to him; and then he fastened it in his button-hole.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 2]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young woman laughed carelessly as he did so; she was too used to students to exaggerate the meaning of their words or deeds, and there was no answering flash in her gray eyes as she looked down on him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you think it too fine to stay indoors?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not in,\" answered the girl turning her head to look up at the blue arch of the sky overhead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well\"—the young fellow bit his lip, and flushed hotly,—\"you know it\u0027s—Come, take a walk across the quadrangle,\" he added boldly. \"There\u0027s no one around.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frances leaned further for a survey of campus and corridor. \"All right!\" she cried, and he could hear her footsteps as she ran down the polished stair in the big old house. When she opened the great hall door she was charmingly demure. \"Glad to see you Mr. Lawson!\" she exclaimed mischievously to the young man, who stood hat in hand by the wide step.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Delighted, I\u0027m sure!\" he flashed back, holding the hand she extended as long as he[Pg 3] dared,—so long that the young woman had drawn herself up quite straight and was looking gravely along the corridor when he released it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You haven\u0027t mailed your letter!\" she said looking at the missive he still held.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! and I came—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s the box, don\u0027t forget it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which way are you going?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Up to the Rotunda, of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"See how it commands everything else,\" said Frances, pausing at the sunken, well-worn steps in the terraced corridor to look about her. The morning shadows of the maples on the quadrangle stretched to the brick pavement at their feet, scarlet and yellow leaves, blown across the green grass, rustled about them; the picturesque buildings on the other side the campus loomed in deep shadowings, for the sun was yet behind them. A late student slammed his door and went hurrying down the corridor, his footsteps echoing along the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is beautiful!\" said Frances softly, as she went up the few steps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 4]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beautiful, yes, and you don\u0027t appreciate it half as much—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Appreciate it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you hear the men raving over it everywhere? Those from a good long distance especially—Oregon, for instance, that\u0027s my state you know; but you Virginians—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are not given to boasting!\" said the girl proudly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There you are! You are\"—\"a queer lot,\" he was about to say, but remembered himself in time. \"You are—\" he blundered; \"one scarce knows how to take you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t take us!\" said the girl quietly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Miss Holloway,\" deprecated the young man, \"you see, the things other people think you would be proudest of, you don\u0027t care for at all, and the things other people don\u0027t care for—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps there are some people who don\u0027t talk about the things they care for most. Perhaps,\" she went on, her flushing cheek and darkening eye belying her light tone, \"that\u0027s a secret you haven\u0027t found out, and[Pg 5] it may be the reason you don\u0027t know how to take us,\" she repeated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not going to quarrel about it a morning like this,\" declared the young man as they went up the wide steps to the Rotunda and along the marble floor of the east wing which roofed over the rooms devoted to the learning of law.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, nothing is worth it,\" answered the girl as she leaned against the balustrade at the edge and looked off towards the mountains, and they both were silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a scene the young man had not yet gotten used to, nor the girl either, though she was born in its sight. Beyond the stretch of the outer grounds of the University, beyond the far-reaching roofs and spires of Charlottesville and the narrow valley of the Rapidan, rose, high and bold, the last spur of the Ragged Mountains. The blue haze veiled it even at this early hour; the frost clothing much of it showed all colors save those of sombre hue; and, set on its crown, just where it began to dip downwards, shone the whiteness of Monticello.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 6]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was a great man!\" said the young man presently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl nodded. No one ever sat thus, the buildings of the University stretching at their feet, Monticello gleaming on its mountain crest and asked the name of the man they lauded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By and by she asked a question. \"For what is Jefferson noted?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For being the founder of the democratic—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I thought so!\" indignantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed! Oh! for founding the University of Virginia.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know your lesson quite well,\" with a little tinge of sarcasm; \"if you stay here long enough you\u0027ll find he did a great many other things. Ah! he knew the beautiful. Look! were there ever any buildings more in harmony, more exquisite in design, more fitted for living—Pshaw!\" she broke off petulantly at the young man\u0027s laugh, \"you\u0027ve made me boast! You\u0027ve seen Monticello?\" she asked a little haughtily, as she straightened from her leaning position.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 7]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl\u0027s eyes darkened as she stood looking down the campus from her point of vantage, and though she was too proud to speak again of its beauty—for it was her home—the young man\u0027s glances followed hers and he noted it all; the inner quadrangle framed in its buildings of quaint architecture, the velvet green of the campus, set with maples, and dipping thrice and then deeply toward the gleaming buildings at the end; the long stretch of corridors and white pillars, the professors\u0027 houses rising two-storied above the students\u0027 homes: and about these, outside, the wide grounds, the embowering trees, yellow and russet and red; rows of cottages showing their tops here and there; and far off, rimming it all, the misty, hazy mountain tops.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going into the library,\" announced Frances, all the banter gone from her voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you been to breakfast?\" in astonishment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Haven\u0027t you? Oh! you are lazy! You[Pg 8] must go at once. Mrs. Lancey won\u0027t save it for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes she will!\" He followed her into the fairy white interior of the Rotunda, with its great pillars bearing above their Corinthian pilasters the carved circle on which were written the names of the giants of the book world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had some faint desire to see before which of the cases she would pause. He was proud of his knowledge of his fellow beings, but this young woman puzzled him. It was a pleasure to his beauty-loving eyes to gaze on her—tall, slender, but well set up, frank-eyed, clear-skinned with an air of utter independence; the things he had heard her say and seen her do kept her from any place in his category.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The long serge gown rustling softly on the marble pavement, she went straight to the books she wanted. It was late, and she wished to avoid the stream of students that would soon be setting roomwards and hallwards.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She took down the volumes instantly[Pg 9]—Fiske\u0027s \"Old Virginia and her Neighbors,\" and Byrd\u0027s \"History of the Dividing Line.\" If Lawson was astonished she gave him no chance to express it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must hurry to breakfast,\" she insisted as they went out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young man looked down at the sunlit quadrangle. \"Won\u0027t you go for a drive about ten?\" he asked abruptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He caught his breath, but before he could answer—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Susan wants some chickens. I promised her I\u0027d get them. You are not going out?\" severely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s such a temptation!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Young men who come all the way from Oregon come to study.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He strove for answer, but the young woman\u0027s nod was positive. It sent him to the mess hall, while she hurried along the corridor, hurried to avoid the crowd that would soon be abroad. So she had been trained, and such was second nature. She was not afraid of any student or of all of[Pg 10] them. She had had delightful friends among them. But she was not a students\u0027 belle; her dear father\u0027s abhorrence of such had kept her unscathed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She lived among them, but the traditions of her household kept her apart. She was motherless, but her mother\u0027s influence had set her feet in the path of freedom and her father saw to it that they kept their way. In all the gay students\u0027 life that surged about her she was somehow untouched. She was keenly alive to its phases, to all the life as a whole, but not to any unit forming it. She saw the belles of the season come and go at Christmas, at Easter, or the Finals, without the least desire to outshine them, or shine with them; yet it would have been easy enough had she wished it. Had she social aspirations she would find many matrons in the professors\u0027 homes to chaperon her; had she been sentimental she could have made many a bosom friend in the young girls of the town; had she been trained otherwise, her record from her first long skirt might have been one of reckless[Pg 11] flirtations—for there is no limit to a student\u0027s daring—but as it was, she lived among them quite simply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She ordered her father\u0027s house; she read, few knew how deeply; she rode, she drove, and went her own way happily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One lesson she had at heart. She took the young men about her without an atom of seriousness. It was this which nettled Frank Lawson.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His attentions had been taken quite seriously usually, too seriously once, he might have remembered. It aroused his insistence; it sent him loitering by the gate to the grounds when Frances came driving down the ribbony road winding outwards.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think you might take me,\" he declared, as she drove slowly by.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jump in!\" Frances pulled the horse around and left the wheels towards him hospitably opened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lawson thought of the beauty he had driven the afternoon before, of the roses on her breast for which she had thanked him so graciously, of the shining skins of[Pg 12] his horses and the glittering wheels of his carriage, and he set his teeth; but he climbed up into the trap and sat down by Frances\u0027 side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She did not offer him the reins, and he hated being driven by a woman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know most of the roads about here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young man assented.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Out towards Monticello and down beyond the University and Park Street; but you don\u0027t know this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frances had turned towards town, and was driving smartly past Chancellor\u0027s and Anderson\u0027s, bookstore and drug store and loitering grounds of the students, though the porches were empty now, along the long street, across the high bridge spanning the narrow valley through which the Southern railroad swept into the town, on down a steep hill; and then she pulled sharply to the left, down a rough road past negro cabins, another sharp hill, across a clear mountain stream, and they were in the country.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 13]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve never been this way before,\" repeated Frances as she began to point out the features of the country. She spoke of house and cabin and mill; but Lawson\u0027s eyes were turned towards the misty mountains. The keen air blew in his face, the frosty touch sent his pulses tingling: the smell of green grass and falling leaves and fresh earth was abroad, and over there, to right to left, swam the mountain-tops in purple mists. Each hill they topped showed vistas of hill and valley and far-reaching crest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The horse went at a good pace; his driver was the most companionable of drivers; Lawson was absurdly happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s that little blue flower?\" he asked, pointing to a starry bloom, daisy-shaped, blossoming on a weed-like stem.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s another of the beauties for which we thank Jefferson, that and the Scotch broom in the woods; you saw it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But where does this come from?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t ask me! Scotland, also, perhaps; here we are!\" She pulled up sharply before[Pg 14] a cabin by the road, and, before he could take the reins she threw down, sprang out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lawson sat feeling like a chagrined schoolboy. It was one of the small accomplishments of which he was proud, to lift a woman from carriage or saddle. He had strong muscles well trained, and he had a fashion of putting his hands at the woman\u0027s waist and giving her a lift, quick, light, and sure, and setting her on her feet with a look of pleased astonishment in her eyes; now he sat holding the reins like any good boy and watching the flutter of a blue skirt around the clusters of zinnias and marigolds by the cabin corner. And then he heard voices and laughter and the squawks of terrified chickens.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frances was coming back,—a colored woman, with a bunch of chickens in either hand, walking by her side. He listened to the woman with intense amusement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why don\u0027t you say thanky?\" she was demanding.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frances only laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I done tole yuh how pretty yuh is; now why don\u0027t yuh say thanky?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 15]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She ought to, that she ought,\" called Lawson from the trap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi, honey!\" cried the delighted darkey, \"is dat him? La, chile, now he suttenly is a nice beau!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aunt Roxie,\" said Frances haughtily, \"put the chickens in the back of the trap. You\u0027re sure you\u0027ve got them tied all right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Co\u0027se I is!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lawson, delighted with Frances\u0027 discomfiture, was fussing about, helping the colored woman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jes lissen at her, jes as mighty as you please,\" she muttered to him, and then quite loudly, \"some folks suttenly is hard to please; yuh praises dem, dey got nutten to say; yuh praises de beau an\u0027 dey looks mad!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never mind!\" cried Frances, \"never mind! I\u0027m not going to bring you any tobacco next time I come!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"La! Miss Frances, what mattah long yuh now—yuh know—hyar, chile, lemme pull yuh some dese hyar flowers; de fros\u0027 done totch dem anyhow!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Frances was not listening; she was off[Pg 16] fast as her horse would trot, the chickens squawking indignantly, and Roxie by her zinnias and marigolds gazing in open-mouthed astonishment. Lawson was shaking with laughter. He was even with her he felt, and perhaps a little ahead. He was sure he was ahead when, just outside the University gate, one of the chickens, freed after much straining, fluttered under the edge of Frances\u0027 skirt and shrieked a loud and triumphant squawk. Frances sprang to her feet; but for Lawson she would have been out and under the wheel. There was no laughter about that young man for one swift instant, when he threw his arm out, pulled her back into the seat and snatched the falling reins. The danger past, he caught the offending fowl, fluttering now in the dash-board, handed it gravely to Frances and then, without a word of excuse, leaned back and laughed until the tears were in his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for Frances, she was white, she was cold. She had been frightened for the first time in her life into a silly deed. She was mad through and through, but it was useless.[Pg 17] Under that ringing laugh all else gave way; she must join in it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never mind,\" she declared, when Lawson drew rein outside the quadrangle and lifted her out impressively. \"I shall have that chicken for supper.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m coming to help eat him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come on!\" she called gayly, as she disappeared along the walk to the campus.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2276/63851.html","bookId":593,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:18:39 AM"}
