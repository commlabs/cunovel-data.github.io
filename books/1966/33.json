She reaches up and gives him a hug, probably for luck, but then he picks her up and kisses her in front of the then he picks her up and kisses her in front of the entire crowd. Everyone starts clapping and cheering for them, including me and JJ. Henry’s grinning at them too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach throws his clipboard on the ground and yel s,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carter, get your ass on the field!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePul ing his helmet on, Carter jogs out to us, and both JJ and I shove him around a bit. “Thanks for joining us, hot lips,” JJ says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re playing the game at Vanderbilt University, and since we have the better record, Woodbridge High cal s the toss. They say heads. It lands on tails. I choose to receive the kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run back to the sidelines, meeting Henry as he goes out to return the kickoff. We knock fists, then he knocks fists with Carter and JJ. I shove thoughts of Henry from my mind—I need to get in the zone, so I turn and look at the Woodbridge bench. A team from Western Tennessee, we’ve never played them before, and neither did my bro. I’ve never seen them play either. But I’ve done my homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quarterback doesn’t have a great arm, but he’s quick and he’s smart. He knows how to direct the field, but he carries the bal more than anything. I told Carter to focus on containing the QB, or he’l run it. Carter loves to sack the quarterback, but we can’t afford to have him miss, because if the QB escapes, I don’t think anyone on our team has the speed to stop him except Henry. And Henry can’t play both wide receiver and defensive back. Besides, he’s too thin to play defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Henry, I also know the Woodbridge kicker has a much more powerful leg than most high school players. “Henry!” I yel when he’s almost into position at the Woodbridge end zone. He sprints back over to the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?” he says, springing up and down, trying to keep his muscles warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know about this dude, right? This kicker?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts his helmet a little, and I see him smiling, his green eyes twinkling. Fog spil s out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously, Woods. Why the hel do you think I was playing so far back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just checking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods toward the stands. “So where are the Alabama coaches?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fiddle with my chinstrap and shrug. “Not here, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not here?” he exclaims. “But this is the last time they’l get to see you play this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite into my upper lip as it dawns on me that unless I do what Dad says and look at some other options, this may be the last time I ever real y get to play. The last time I ever huddle under hundreds of lights and smel the freshly painted yard lines and hear fans cheering. The last time I ever throw my perfect spiral in a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath. “Remember that time I was searching for crickets at your game, and the bal went out of bounds and I threw it back to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup,” he says with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI return the smile. “Were you mad that I took your position?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Course not. I could see how much you loved playing bal …and that made me love the game even more. I’ve always loved catching your passes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Michigan asked you to join their team, but then, like, made it clear you weren’t going to get to play, would you stil wanna go there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pul s his helmet al the way off and stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way. I want to play bal . And if that’s why Alabama isn’t here tonight, then it’s their loss.” He pats my elbow. “You can do better, and you know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henry!” Coach yel s. “Could I trouble you to receive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henry!” Coach yel s. “Could I trouble you to receive the kickoff, or should I send JJ out to do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry runs backward onto the field, staring at me as he puts his helmet back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jog to the benches, where I stand between JJ and Carter as Woodbridge gets ready to kick off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTy comes up behind me and whispers, “Henry knows about the kicker, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I say through gritted teeth. It’s my job to captain this team, not Ty’s. He stil doesn’t get that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Ty replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodbridge kicks off and Henry catches the bal . Sprinting, he makes it to the thirty-yard line before he’s tackled. We al scream and celebrate, yel ing Henry’s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woods,” Coach says, “Take it up the gut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it, Coach.” To see how good the Woodbridge defense is, Coach wants to test them by running the bal up the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jog out to the thirty and huddle with the guys. “Statue of Liberty to Bates.” We al clap our hands once and break. JJ hikes the bal to me, I take three steps back and with my right hand, I pretend to throw the bal to Henry, who’s running up the right side of the field. This causes most of the defense to change direction, and when they do, I hand the bal off with my left hand to Bates, who grabs it and darts up the middle of the field. The Statue of Liberty trick only works occasional y, but with this experiment, I can see that the defense is expecting me to pass every chance I get. Bates makes it eleven yards before getting tackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe run up to the line and I yel , “Blue fifty, red twenty, blue fifty, red thirty!” Red thirty is the cue. JJ hikes the bal and I throw it down the field to Higgins. A cornerback is al over him, and Higgins misses the bal and crashes to the ground. Incomplete. Damn it. The Woodbridge defense might be better than I thought. If we want to score, Henry’s our best chance, but the defense is doubling up on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe huddle. “Post route to Henry. Take a hard left at the twenty-yard line,” I say. Henry claps his hands. JJ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehikes the bal , and Henry takes off down the field so fast he confuses the Woodbridge defensive line. At the twenty, a cornerback catches up to Henry, but Henry takes a quick left and catches my perfect pass and darts off. Taking huge strides, he barely beats the cornerback to the end zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouchdown! I jump and yel and rip off my helmet. I pump my fist as we jog back to the sidelines, where I grab Henry by the jersey. “Nice!” I say. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/catching-jordan-hundred-oaks-1/page-33.html","bookId":1966,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:33 AM"}
