The surfaces, he saw, cavorted with carvings, unrecognizable sigils so intricate they spun and shifted before his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he drew closer, silts gusted ahead, and Bruthen Trana saw a figure climbing into view. Armour green with verdigris and furred with slime. A closed helm covering its face. In one gauntleted hand was a Letherii sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a voice spoke in the Tiste Edur’s head: ‘You have walked enough, Ghost.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana halted. ‘I am not a ghost in truth-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are, stranger. Your soul has been severed from now cold, now rotting flesh. You are no more than what stands here, before me. A ghost.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, the realization did not surprise him. Hannan Mosag’s legacy of treachery made all alliances suspect. And he had, he realized, felt… severed. For a long time, yes. The Warlock King likely did not waste any time in cutting the throat of Bruthen Trana’s helpless body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then,’ he said, ‘what is left for me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘One thing, Ghost. You are here to summon him. To send him back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But was not his soul severed as well?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘His flesh and bones are here, Ghost. And in this place, there is power. For here you will find the forgotten gods, the last hold’ ing of their names. Know this, Ghost, were we to seek to defy you, to refuse your summoning, we could. Even with what you carry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Will you then refuse me?’ Bruthen Trana asked, and if the answer was yes, then he would laugh. To have come all this way. To have sacrificed his life…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. We understand the need. Better, perhaps, than you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armoured warrior lifted his free hand. All but the fore\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emost of the metal-clad fingers folded. ‘Go there,’ it said, pointing towards a pillar. ‘The side with but one name. Draw forth that which you possess of his flesh and bone. Speak the name so written on the stone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana walked slowly to the standing stone, went round to the side with the lone carving. And read thereon the name inscribed: ‘ “Brys Beddict, Saviour of the Empty Hold.” I summon you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face of the stone, cleaned here, seeming almost fresh, all at once began to ripple, then bulge in places, the random shapes and movement coalescing to create a humanoid shape, pushing out from the stone. An arm came free, then shoulder, then head, face-eyes closed, features twisted as if in pain-upper torso. A leg. The second arm-Bruthen saw that two fingers were missing on that hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. Two?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the currents streamed, Brys Beddict was driven out from the pillar. He fell forward onto his hands and knees, was almost swallowed in billowing silts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armoured warrior arrived, carrying a scabbarded sword, which he pushed point-first into the seabed beside the Letherii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Take it, Saviour. Feel the currents-they are eager. Go, you have little time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill on his hands and knees, head hanging, Brys Beddict reached out for the weapon. As soon as his hand closed about the scabbard a sudden rush of the current lifted the man from the seabed. He spun in a flurry of silts and then was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana stood, motionless. That current had rushed right through him, unimpeded. As it would through a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once he felt bereft. He’d not had a chance to say a word to Brys Beddict, to tell him what needed to be done. An Emperor, to cut down once more. An empire, to resurrect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are done here, Ghost.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where will you go?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is a house. I lost it. I would find it again.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you shall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, Padderunt, look! It’s twitching!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man squinted over at Selush through a fog of smoke. She was doing that a lot of late. Bushels of rustleaf ever since Tehol Beddict’s arrest. ‘You’ve dressed enough dead to know what the lungs of people who do too much of that look like, Mistress.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. No different from anyone else’s.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unless they got the rot, the cancer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lungs with the rot all look the same and that is most certainly true. Now, did you hear what I said?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It twitched,’ Padderunt replied, twisting in his chair to peer up at the bubbly glass jar on the shelf that contained a stubby little severed finger suspended in pink goo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s about time, too. Go,to Rucket,’ Selush said between ferocious pulls on the mouthpiece, her substantial chest swelling as if it was about to burst. ‘And tell her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That it twitched.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-444.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
