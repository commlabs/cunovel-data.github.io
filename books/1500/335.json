A myriad of candle lights seemed to brighten at the same time, and then the sound of music began. The melodious violin and gloomy cello formed a beautiful evening mood.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTwo glasses of aperitif wine were brought under the cheerful music, and at the same time, a large rose flower was brought over. This originated from the olden era, an original rose that had never undergone the slightest genetic change! In this era of turmoil where there was radiation everywhere, it went without saying how expensive a stalk of a pure and original plant was.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe wine and rose were placed in front of the woman’s face, and then it immediately lost color.

A skilled sculptor could make his work appear to possess life, while this living beauty instead only gave off a cold and mechanical feeling, like a piece of lifeless steel.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“My dear Miss Helen, it is an honor to meet your distinguished self again. I wonder if this environment brings you any satisfaction?” Ricardo’s attitude and tone were completely in accordance with that of the olden era’s nobility. However, what was regretful was that this extravagant and romantic dinner that could move the hearts of most women in Dragon City didn’t seem very effective on Helen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen replied unenthusiastically, “I’ll know if it is satisfactory after I’ve eaten.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePa!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRicardo snapped his fingers, and then the dinner that was both delicious and lavish officially began.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Helen picked up the knife and fork, Ricardo felt a bit absent-minded.

Her movements were extremely graceful, but what was even more noteworthy was its precision. Every single movement was done without the slightest waste of strength, and the paths they took balanced both etiquette and distance. Then, she maintained her perfect bearing as she moved the food to her mouth in the most efficient method.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen ate quickly, fast to the point where the dishes almost didn’t seem to be able to catch up, and there was almost no time to talk, because her mouth had never been empty. However, even the supervisor who had worked in this restaurant for over 20 years felt that apart from eating a bit too fast, it was difficult for him to pick out anything else that was unusual.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRicardo didn’t have any interest in the culinary delicacies in front of him and only silently watched Helen. He originally prepared countless words of love and many poems to open up Helen’s inner heart during this beautiful evening, but when he really sat in front of Helen, he suddenly noticed that he actually couldn’t say a single word.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen’s every movement left him feeling great shock!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Helen even finished the post-meal dessert, Ricardo only had a glass of red wine left in front of him, and he hadn’t even touched it yet.

Meanwhile, Ricardo was deeply infatuated with Helen’s unique style. He cleaned up his disorderly and chaotic mind with great difficulty, looked at Helen, and then said with an extremely serious voice, “Helen, I believe that I have already fallen in love with you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen folded the meal cloth neatly on the table, and then she looked at Ricardo before saying indifferently, “Then I can say with certainty that your tastes really are unique.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA faint vein began to bulge on Ricardo’s forehead. “Then what are normal tastes?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen replied without the slightest bit of hesitation, “For example, Su, he treats me like an ice cold piece of medical equipment.
