She just couldn’t understand why Sheng Mei did what she did. “You said that Sheng Mei has a great enmity with the Soul Emperor and after she took away your strength she still left behind a wisp of her source soul in your body, and even sealed her primordial yin and Grand Reincarnation Art into it? But what is the meaning behind doing all of this? In that sort of situation, the chances of you overcoming the odds to rise once more were nearly zero. Sheng Mei didn’t know you had the Magic Cube either, so why would she think you could restore your strength?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming sighed and shook his head. “I am not sure either.
