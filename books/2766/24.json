{"id":85876,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans on his elbow and stares down at me. \"I didn\u0027t tell you this before, but I think you\u0027ve been a great leader on the base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just saying that because you love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love you. But that\u0027s not why I said it. People listen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? Yeah, right. It\u0027s a wonder I haven\u0027t been kicked out of the program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sell yourself short. Every time your team is standing around looking for some direction, you come up with a strategy. Like suggesting taking turns with the ditch digging. And suggesting people kneel on the ground during the monkey bars on the obstacle course. Whether you believe it or not, you\u0027re a born leader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I never thought about that before. I reach up and cup his cheek. \"How come you can see the good parts of me I don\u0027t even see in myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re too busy focusing on negative stuff. You should stop doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying. It\u0027s kinda hard for me.\" I lean forward, put my hand on his bare chest, and kiss him. \"I\u0027m what you call a work in progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes two of us.\" He puts his arms around me. We kiss. And kiss again. His lips are soft on mine. When he deepens the kiss and his tongue reaches for mine, the tingling sensation zings right down to my toes and back up again. I could kiss this boy forever. His kisses make me as hot as my flat iron, and I toss the covers away. My fingers trail paths around his body and his do the same. All the while, our breathing is getting faster and my pulse is racing in excitement. Our legs are intertwined, skin against skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel Avi\u0027s pulse racing too, as my palm explores his chest and abs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing close to Avi, his body against mine, is the best feeling in the world. It\u0027s better than eating spicy tuna sushi rolls with little pieces of crunchy tempura inside, better than drinking hot chocolate with loads of whipped cream, better than winning a tennis match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking about?\" he asks as I moan under his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sushi, hot chocolate, and tennis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking about food? And tennis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls away, but I take his hand in mine and weave my fingers through his. \"No. I\u0027m thinking about how being with you is better than sushi, hot chocolate, and tennis. What were you thinking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short laugh escapes from his mouth. \"It sure wasn\u0027t hummus, falafel, and soccer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my fingers so we\u0027re palm against palm. \"Avi, what if we get carried away tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if I want to? My mom bought me protection before I left, just in case. It\u0027s in one of my suitcases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi takes a deep breath and leans away from me, the cool air rushing to the open space between us. I want to pull him back so his body heats mine again. Instead, I grab the covers and pull them over us. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m shivering from nervousness or the chilly night air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not gonna lie to you,\" he says seriously. \"I\u0027m ready. Like right now, I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I am, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your body might be, but I know in the morning you\u0027ll regret it. And then I\u0027ll feel like crap because I knew you\u0027d regret it.\" He rubs his hands over his head and moans in frustration. \"You said a while back that you wanted to wait until we got married. I promised to respect that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me. I changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, you hated that you were an illegitimate child. It eats at you every day, and I think sometimes it fuels this insecurity you have. What if it happens to us? You\u0027ll never forgive yourself. Or me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you not be logical now, Avi? You\u0027re kind of ruining the mood.\" I sit up, thinking how right Avi is and how wrong I am. How can I let my overactive hormones rule my life? Though I must say it\u0027s kind of easy when Avis expert fingers are strumming my body like a guitar. \"Avi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not tired anymore. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can still kiss and do other things, can\u0027t we? Remember at my house on the sofa, when my dad was working late? Can we try that again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, it\u0027s not like Avi and I haven\u0027t fooled around. We have. In fact, I\u0027ve gone farther with Avi than with any other boy I\u0027ve dated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi\u0027s hands circle my waist and he guides me on top of him. My long hair shields his face as I look down at him. \"Ani ohevet o\u0027tach,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just said I love you to a girl. Oat\u0027cha is for a boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ani ohevet oat\u0027cha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ani ohevet o\u0027tach. I love you, Amy Nelson-Barak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kiss, and I start to move against him. My pulse is racing, and Avi\u0027s heart is pounding against my skin... and the earth is shattering into two pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earth is shattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we\u0027re falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize pretty quickly, through my haze of teenage sexual lust, that the earth isn\u0027t moving. Our beds are. They\u0027re moving apart and Avi and I are falling in between them. Before I know it, Avi falls to the hard cement tile floor. I\u0027m straddling him, so lucky for me his body breaks my fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch,\" Avi says, his head banging on the tile. \"I think I just got a splinter from the bed frame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think this was a sign from God?\" I ask. We are in the Holy Land. God can\u0027t be far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like a sign from your dad,\" Avi says, helping me up. \"He always warns me not to touch your parts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it\u0027s God or my dad or some other divine intervention, Avi and I decide it\u0027s late and we should probably get as much sleep as we can before we have to head back to the base. Instead of sleeping with our beds pushed together and having another mini-disaster, Avi sleeps on his bed and I sleep on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bridge the gap between our beds by holding hands until we both fall asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0027t know where you\u0027ve come from, it\u0027s hard to know where you\u0027re going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever been to the Western Wall?\" I ask Avi in the morning when we wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many times. I got my Bible during my army induction ceremony there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it like? Rabbi Glassman told me it\u0027s super mystical and spiritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi sits up, and I think how unfair it is that someone can look so good in the morning. Of course he doesn\u0027t have to worry about bed-head because his hair is so short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubs his chin pensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I say, urging him to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts up a finger. \"Yeah, urn, it is spiritual. I\u0027m not orthodox, but I definitely feel closer to God when I\u0027m there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my eyes. \"So what\u0027s all the chin-rubbing about? Don\u0027t you think I\u0027ll be spiritually moved there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely. But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi scratches his head. \"But it\u0027s got a mechitza. You know, a partition, separating the men from the women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay with that. Rabbi Glassman said it\u0027s tradition in more religious synagogues to separate men and women so they can concentrate on praying and not each other. If you\u0027re with me, I\u0027ll definitely be distracted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re okay with it even if the men\u0027s side is four times the size of the women\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink positive, Amy. \"Um, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And women aren\u0027t supposed to pray out loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And men...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... pray out loud,\" he says, wincing in anticipation of my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth is, I\u0027m okay with it. I\u0027m going with the flow. Even if I don\u0027t observe all of the Jewish rules and traditions, I respect the people who do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have time this morning, if you want me to take you there. We\u0027ll be backtracking a bit, but it\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time does it open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always open, Amy. Come on, let\u0027s get ready so we can get back to the base on time. Make sure you wear something that covers your knees and shoulders. No tanks or shorts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t take long before we\u0027re showered, dressed, and heading back toward Jerusalem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe park a few blocks from the Western Wall. The scenery mixes the old with the new. When we come up to the Wall, the big ancient stones stacked one on top of another reach out to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathe in slowly as I take in the scene. There\u0027s a big area farther from the Wall where people can walk, but if you want to go closer, there\u0027s a partition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly in front of the Wall, people are praying. The men bob up and down, deep in prayer, facing the Wall. Women, on the right side of the partition, pray just as fervently (albeit more quietly) on their side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerusalem was destroyed nine times,\" Avi explains as he covers his head with a small, round kippah. \"But through it all, the Kotel survived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of like the Water Tower that survived the Great Chicago Fire, which started when Mrs. O\u0027Leary\u0027s cow kicked over a lantern (although that historical fact has been hotly debated by the descendants of Mrs. O\u0027Leary). Nobody debates the fact that this wall has been here for three thousand years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say God is here, right?\" I ask Avi. Because I\u0027m feeling the enormity of the Wall and the attachment my Jewish ancestors have to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the holiest of holy places for us. That\u0027s why, even when you\u0027re in America, Jews pray facing east--toward the Wall. Even in Israel, no matter where we are, we pray facing Jerusalem and the Wall. Open up and pour your heart out to God here, Amy.\" Avi hands me a small piece of paper and pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell Avi to go to the men\u0027s side while I head to the women\u0027s. I look up at the Wall, its chalky yellow boulders neatly stacked one on top of one another. Each boulder is as tall as my chest. The closer I get, the more I see little pieces of paper wedged in between the cracks of the stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t ask me why tears come to my eyes when I\u0027m a few inches away from the Wall. I feel my faith getting stronger here, especially when I think about the Jews being forbidden here as recently as 1948, when Jews could only view the Wall through barbed wire. In the Six Day War, Israeli soldiers fought and died for this wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes me feel privileged just being here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, I touch the Wall. The ancient stones are cold, even though it\u0027s hot outside. For thousands of years, my ancestors prayed here. In the future, I hope my children come to Israel and feel this wall, considered \"the gate to God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scribble my prayers on the paper, words to be shared only between me and God. In my head, I say the She\u0027ma, the holiest Jewish prayer. She\u0027ma Yisrael! Adonai Eloheinu! Adonai Echad! Hear O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One! and squeeze my paper inside a crack between the boulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over to the men\u0027s side and spot Avi. He\u0027s in his military uniform, touching the Wall with his hand and forehead, deep in prayer. The scene touches my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, take care of him, I pray silently. Because he\u0027s my past, and my future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no shame in admitting you\u0027re an American Princess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hows your safta?\" Jess asks me in the late afternoon when I join the rest of our unit in the barracks after Avi and I arrive back on base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI organize my cubby and slide my suitcases under my bed. \"She\u0027s okay. Her white blood cell counts are low, but they\u0027ve stabilized her. She told me to go back and finish the program... something about Baraks not being quitters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re back.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-24.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
