{"id":90529,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Melanie said quietly, \"that it\u0027s time to talk about the skull. Adam\u0027s never told us exactly how he found it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027ve been very secretive about that,\" Faye put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-but maybe now is the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana and Adam looked at each other, and then Diana nodded slightly. \"All right, then, tell it. Try not to leave anything out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the walk back from the cemetery they had crowded, all twelve of them, into Diana\u0027s room. Cassie looked around at the group and realized that it was divided. Suzan, Deborah, and the Henderson brothers were sitting on one side, near Faye, while Laurel, Melanie, Adam, and Sean were on the other side, near Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, Cassie thought, watching Sean\u0027s uneasily shifting eyes, Sean was sitting on Diana\u0027s side for the moment. He could change any time. And so could Nick-Nick could vote with Diana one day, and then for no apparent reason vote with Faye the next. Nick was always an unknown factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, a voice inside her whispered, are you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was ridiculous. Nothing-not even Faye-could make Cassie vote against Diana. Not when it really counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was talking in a low, thoughtful voice, as if he were trying to remember precisely. \"It wasn\u0027t off Cape Cod, it was farther north, closer to Boston. Everybody knows there are seventeen islands off Boston Bay; they\u0027re all deserted and covered with weeds. Well, I found an eighteenth. It wasn\u0027t like the others; it was flat and sandy and there was no sign that people had ever been there. And there was something strange about it. ... I\u0027d been to the place before, but I\u0027d never seen it. It was as if my eyes had suddenly been opened after-\" He stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie, looking at the lamp\u0027s reflection on Diana\u0027s gleaming pine-board floor, felt as if she were smothering. She didn\u0027t dare breathe until Adam went on, \"-after working on the fishing boats all summer. But when I tried to head for the island, the tiller bucked, trying to keep me away or run me aground on the rocks. I had to wrestle with it to bring the boat in-and I had to call on Earth and Water or I\u0027d never have made it. When I was finally safe I looked at the rocks and saw the wreckage of other boats. Anybody that had made it there before didn\u0027t make it away again alive.\" He took a deep, slow breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as I stepped on the sand I could feel that the whole island was electric. I knew it was the place even before I saw the circle of stones in the middle. It was just the way Black John described it. Sea heather had grown up around the rocks, but the center was clear and that\u0027s where I dug. About a minute later my shovel hit something hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\" said Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then I pulled it out. I felt-I don\u0027t know, dizzy, when I saw it. The sun was glittering on the sand and it sort of blinded me. Then I wrapped the skull up in my shirt and left. The island didn\u0027t fight when I went; it was like a trap that had been sprung. That was- let\u0027s see, September twenty-first. As soon as I got back to the Bay, I wanted to start up to New Salem, but I had some things to take care of. I couldn\u0027t get started until the next day, and I knew I was going to be late for Kori\u0027s initiation.\" He paused and threw an apologetic glance toward Doug and Chris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey said nothing, but Cassie felt eyes flicker toward her. Kori\u0027s initiation had become Cassie\u0027s initiation, because on that morning Kori had been found dead at the bottom of the high-school steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just what is the point of all this storytelling?\" Faye asked, her husky voice bored. \"Unless\"-she straightened up, looking more interested-\"you think the rest of the Master Tools may be on that island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you before,\" Adam said. \"There was nothing else there, Faye. Just the skull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the point is that we need to know more about the skull,\" Diana put in. \"For better or worse, we\u0027re stuck with it now. I don\u0027t think we should put it back on the island-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it back!\" Faye exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-where anybody might find it, now that the protective spell is broken. It\u0027s not safe there. I don\u0027t know if it will be safe anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now,\" Faye murmured, looking sleepy. \"If it\u0027s too much trouble for you, I\u0027ll be glad to take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana just shot her a look that said Faye was the last person she\u0027d ask to take care of the skull. But, Cassie noticed with a sinking feeling, Faye\u0027s heavy-lidded amber eyes were not fixed on Diana\u0027s face. They were trained on the little gold key at Diana\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie started, hard enough that Laurel turned around and looked at her in surprise. But it was only Diana\u0027s father, who\u0027d come home with a bulging briefcase in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Meade looked around the crowded room in mild surprise, as if he didn\u0027t quite know who all these people were. Cassie wondered suddenly how much he knew about the Circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everyone staying for dinner?\" he asked Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-no,\" Diana said, looking at a dainty white and gold clock on the nightstand. \"I didn\u0027t realize it was after seven, Dad. I\u0027ll fix something quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, and after one more quick, uncertain glance around the room, left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBedsprings creaked and clothing rustled as everyone else got up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow we can meet at school,\" Melanie said. \"But I\u0027ve got to study tonight; this whole last week has been shot and I\u0027ve got a biology test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" said Laurel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got algebra homework,\" Suzan offered, and Deborah muttered, \"Meaning you\u0027ve got a week\u0027s worth of soap tapes in the VCR.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, we\u0027ll meet tomorrow,\" Diana said. She walked downstairs with them. Faye managed to catch Cassie\u0027s arm as the others were leaving, and she breathed in her ear, \"Get it tonight. Call me and I\u0027ll come and pick it up; then we\u0027ll put it back before morning so she won\u0027t notice it\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie pulled her arm away rebelliously. But at the door, Faye gave her a meaningful look, and the flash in those amber eyes alarmed her. She stared at Faye a long moment, then nodded slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to stay?\" Adam was saying to Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Cassie said quickly, before Diana could answer. They looked at her, startled, and she said, \"I\u0027ll stay and help make dinner, if it\u0027s all right, Diana. I told my grandma and my mom I\u0027d be gone and they\u0027ve probably already eaten by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s graciousness rose to the fore. \"Oh- of course you can stay, then,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll be fine, Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Adam gave Cassie a keen glance, which she returned woodenly. He went out, following Chris and Doug into the darkness. The flicker of a match up ahead showed where Nick was. Cassie looked up at the night sky, which glittered brashly with stars but not a trace of moon, and then stepped back as Diana shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner was quiet, with Mr. Meade sitting there, leafing through a newspaper, occasionally glancing up over his reading glasses at the two girls. Afterward they went back up to Diana\u0027s room. Cassie realized she needed to stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, you never told me about that print,\" she said, pointing. Decorating Diana\u0027s walls were six art prints. Five of them were very similar, black and white with a slightly old-fashioned look. Diana had told her they were pictures of Greek goddesses: Aphrodite, the beautiful but fickle goddess of love;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtemis, the fierce virgin huntress; Hera, the imperious queen of the gods; Athena, the calm gray-eyed goddess of wisdom; and Persephone, who loved flowers and all growing things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the last print was different. It was in color, and the style was more abstract, more modern. It showed a young woman standing beneath a starry sky, while a crescent moon shone silver down on her flowing hair. She was wearing a simple white garment, cut high to show a garter on her thigh. On her upper arm was a silver cuff-bracelet, and on her head was a thin circlet with a crescent moon, horns upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the outfit Diana wore at meetings of the Circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is she?\" Cassie said, staring at the beautiful girl in the print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana,\" Diana said wryly. Cassie turned to her, and she smiled. \"The goddess Diana,\" she added. \"Not the Roman Diana; another one. She\u0027s older than all the Greek goddesses, and she was different from them. She was a Great Goddess; she ruled everything. She was goddess of the night and the moon and the stars-there\u0027s a story that once she turned all the stars into mice to impress the witches on earth. So they made her Queen of the Witches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie grinned. \"I think it would take more than that to impress Faye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. Some people say that her legend was based on an actual person, who taught magic and was a champion of poor women. Other people say she was first a Sun Goddess, but then she got chased out by male Sun Gods and turned to the night. The Romans got her confused with the Greek goddess Artemis-you know, the huntress-but she was much more than that. Anyway, she\u0027s always been Queen of the Witches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you,\" Cassie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana laughed and shook her head. \"I may not always be leader,\" she said. \"It all depends on what happens between now and November tenth. That\u0027s the day of the leadership vote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why November tenth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my birthday-Faye\u0027s too, coincidentally. You have to be seventeen to be permanent leader, and that\u0027s when we both will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was surprised. Diana was still only sixteen, like her? She always seemed so mature, and she was a senior. But it was even stranger that Faye was so young, and that the cousins had the same birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Diana, sitting there on the bed. As beautiful as the girl in the last print was, Diana was more beautiful. With hair that indescribable color, like sunlight and moonlight woven together, and a face like a flower, and eyes like green jewels, Diana resembled something from a fairy tale or legend more than a real person. But the goodness and-well, purity that shone out of Diana\u0027s eyes were very real indeed, Cassie thought. Cassie was proud to be her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the light flashed on the gold key around Diana\u0027s neck and she remembered what she was there to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t, Cassie thought, as her stomach plummeted giddily. She could feel the slow, sick pounding of her heart. Right this minute around her own neck was hanging the crescent-moon necklace that Diana had given her at her initiation. How could she steal from Diana, deceive Diana?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027d been through all that before. There was no way out. Faye would do exactly what she had threatened-Cassie knew that. The only way to save Diana was to deceive her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s for her own good, Cassie told herself. So just stop thinking about it. Do what you have to and get it over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie? You look upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-\" Cassie started to say, no, of course not, and change the subject the way she usually did when somebody caught her daydreaming. But then she had an idea. \"I don\u0027t really feel like going home alone,\" she said, grimacing. \"It\u0027s not just the walk-it\u0027s that house. It creaks and rattles all night long and sometimes I can\u0027t even get to sleep. Especially if I\u0027m thinking about. . . about...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" Diana said, smiling. \"Well, that\u0027s easy to take care of. Sleep here.\" Cassie was stricken at how easily Diana made the offer. \"And if you\u0027re worried about the skull,\" Diana went on, \"you can stop. It\u0027s not going anywhere, and it\u0027s not going to do anything more to hurt people. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s face flamed and she had to struggle not to look at the cabinet. She would never have mentioned the skull herself: she couldn\u0027t have gotten the word out. \"Okay,\" she said, trying to keep her voice normal. \"Thanks. I\u0027ll call my mom and tell her I\u0027m staying over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can drive to your house so you can get dressed in the morning-I\u0027ll check on the guest room.\" As Diana left, the voices in Cassie\u0027s mind were rioting. You little sneak, they shouted at her. You nasty, weaselly, lying little traitor-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up! Cassie shouted back at them, with such force that they actually did shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guest room\u0027s ready,\" Diana said, reappearing as Cassie hung up the phone. \"But if you get scared in the night you can come in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Cassie said, genuinely grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are big sisters for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat up and talked for a while, but neither of them had had much sleep the night before, and as the clock\u0027s hands edged closer to ten they were both yawning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take my bath tonight so you can have one in the morning,\" Diana said. \"The hot water doesn\u0027t last long around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there a spell to take care of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana laughed and tossed a book to her. \"Here, see if you can find one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the Book of Shadows Diana had brought to Cassie\u0027s initiation, the one that had been in Diana\u0027s family since the first witches came to New Salem. The brittle yellow pages had a mildewy smell that made Cassie wrinkle her nose, but she was glad to have this chance to look at it. Toward the beginning of the book the writing was small and almost illegible, but further on it became stylized and beautiful, like copperplate. Different authors, Cassie thought, different generations. The Post-it notes and plastic flags on almost every page were the work of the current generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was full of spells, descriptions of coven meetings, rituals, and stories. Cassie pored over it, her eyes moving in fascination from one title to the next. Some of the spells seemed quaint and archaic; others were like something out of a modern pop-psychology book. Some were just timeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Charm to Cure a Sickly Child, she read. To Make Hens Lay. For Protection Against Fire and Water. To Overcome a Bad Habit. To Cast Out Fear and Malignant Emotions. To Find Treasure. To Change Your Luck. To Turn Aside Evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Talisman For Strength caught her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake a smooth and shapely rock, and upon one face carve the rising sun and a crescent moon, horns up. Upon the reverse, the words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrength of stone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe in my bone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSustain my fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could use that, Cassie thought. She continued flipping through the pages. A Spell Against Contagious Disease. To Hold Evil Harmless. To Cause Dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as if her guilty conscience had summoned it up, another spell appeared before her eyes. For an Untrue Lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the light of a full moon, take a strand of the lover\u0027s hair and tie knots in it, saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo peace find\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo friend keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo lover bind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo harvest reap\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo repose take\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo hunger feed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo thirst slake\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sorrow speed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo debt pay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo fear flee\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRue the day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wronged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s pulse was fluttering in her wrists. Would anyone really put a curse like that on someone they loved, no matter how unfaithful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still staring at the page when there was a movement at the door. She shut the book hastily as Diana came in, hair wrapped in a towel turban. But her eyes were drawn instantly to the gold chain Diana was dropping on the nightstand. It lay there next to a round stone with a spiral pattern in it, gray swirled with pale blue and sprinkled with quartz crystals. The chalcedony rose that Diana had given to Adam, and that Adam had given to Cassie. Now it was back where it belonged, Cassie thought, and something around her heart went numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bathroom\u0027s all yours,\" said Diana. \"Here\u0027s a nightgown-or do you want a T-shirt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nightgown\u0027s fine,\" Cassie said. All the time she was washing up and changing she kept seeing the key. If only Diana would leave it there...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still on the nightstand when she popped her head back in Diana\u0027s room. Diana was already in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to shut the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Diana said, reaching up to turn out the light. \"Just leave it open a bit. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once in the guest room next door Cassie propped herself up on two pillows and lay staring at the ceiling. Strangely, it was almost peaceful, lying there and knowing that for the moment there was nothing she could do but wait. She could hear the sound of the ocean behind Diana\u0027s house, now louder, now softer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited a long time, listening to the quiet sounds. She felt relaxed, until she thought about getting up-then her heart started to pound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she was sure Diana must be asleep. Now, she thought. If you don\u0027t move now, you never will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreath held, she shifted her weight in the bed and let her legs down. The hardwood floor creaked slightly as she crossed it, and she froze each time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside Diana\u0027s door, she stood straining her ears. She could hear nothing. She put her hand on the door and slowly, by infinitesimal degrees, she pushed it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, lungs burning because she was afraid to breathe too loud, she placed one foot inside the threshold and let her weight down on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana was a dim shape on the bed. Please don\u0027t let her eyes be open, Cassie thought. She had the horrible fantasy that Diana was just lying there staring at her. But as she took another slow, careful step inside, and another, she could see that Diana\u0027s eyes were shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, Cassie thought. I have to breathe. She opened her mouth and exhaled and inhaled silently. Her heart was shaking her and she felt dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake tiny steps, she thought. She crept farther into the room until she was standing directly beside Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the nightstand, just a few inches from Diana\u0027s sleeping face, was the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling as if she was moving in slow motion, Cassie put her hand out, placed it flat on the key. She didn\u0027t want to make any noise, but as she slid the necklace toward her, the chain rattled. She closed her fingers over it and held it tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to get away. She forced herself to creep, all the time looking over her shoulder at the bed-was Diana waking up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached the cabinet, and the little brass keyhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFit the key in. She was fumbling; her fingers felt clumsy as sausages. For a moment she panicked, thinking, what if it isn\u0027t the right key after all? But at last she got it in and turned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lock clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot relief swept over Cassie. She\u0027d done it. Now she had to get the skull and call Faye- and what if Faye didn\u0027t answer? What if Diana\u0027s father caught her phoning in the middle of the night, or if Diana woke up and found the skull missing... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as she eased the cabinet door open the world blurred and went dark before her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall light was shining into the cabinet. It was dim, but it was clear enough to show that all Cassie\u0027s caution had been in vain, and all her fears about getting the skull to Faye were pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cabinet was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie never knew how long she stood there, unable to think or move. But at last she pushed the cabinet door shut with shaking hands and locked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it\u0027s not here, then where is it? Where? she demanded frantically of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t think about it now. Put the key back. Or do you want her to wake up while you\u0027re standing here holding it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey back to Diana\u0027s nightstand seemed to take forever, and her stomach ached as if someone were grinding a boot there. The key clinked as she replaced it on the nightstand and the chain stuck to her sweaty hand. But Diana\u0027s breathing remained soft and even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow get out, she ordered herself. She needed to be alone, to try and think. In her hurry to get away she forgot to be careful about placing her feet. A board creaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust keep going, never mind, she thought. Then she heard something that stopped her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustling from the bed. And then Diana\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-captive-the-secret-circle-2/page-3.html","bookId":2096,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:16 PM"}
