AH right, Sterns, send Parks for Harwick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not send Parks for Harwick,\" Jade commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, now isn\u0027t the time to be difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady, what happened to you in this unfortunate mishap? Did someone hit you on your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answered shyly. She lowered her gaze to the I ground. \"I fell. Please don\u0027t become upset on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emy behalf, Sterns,\" she added when she peeked up and caught his Sympathetic expression. \"It\u0027s only a little, insignificant bump. Would you like to see it?\" she asked as she lifted her hair away from her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movement made her side start nagging her again. She couldn\u0027t quite block the pain this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns couldn\u0027t have been more interested in her injury, or more compassionate. While Caine watched, his butler turned into a lady\u0027s maid. He stammered out all sorts of condolences, and when Jade accepted his arm and the two of them started up the steps together, Caine was left to stare after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must put you to bed immediately, dear lady,\" Sterns announced. \"How did you take your fall, mi\u0027lady, if I may be so bold as to inquire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost my balance and fell down a full flight of steps,\" she answered. \"It was very clumsy of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, I\u0027m certain you aren\u0027t at all clumsy,\" Sterns rushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is kind of you to say so, Sterns. Do you know, the pain is not nearly as awful now, but my side .. . well, sir, I don\u0027t wish to alarm you, nor do I wish you to think I\u0027m a complainer ... Caine believes I do nothing but complain and cry. Those were his very words, sir. Yes, they were . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine came up behind her and grabbed hold of her shoulders. \"Let\u0027s have a look at your side. Take\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour jacket off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answered as she walked into the foyer. \"You\u0027ll only prod at it, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA line of servants waited to greet their employer. Jade breezed past them while she held on to Sterns\u0027 arm. \"Sir, is my room in the front of the house? I do hope so. I would love to have a window facing the lovely view of the drive and the forest beyond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of her cheerful tone of voice, Caine decided she\u0027d been exaggerating about her aches. \"Sterns, take her upstairs and get her settled while I take care of a few matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t wait for a reply but turned and walked out the front door again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have Parks fetch the physician,\" Sterns called down from the top of the steps. The butler turned to Jade. \"Don\u0027t argue with us, mi\u0027lady. You look terribly pale to me. I cannot help but notice that your hands feel like ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade hastily removed her hand from his. She hadn\u0027t realized she\u0027d held onto him as she climbed the steps. Sterns had noticed, of course. The poor dear was obviously worn out. Why, she was actually trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sun will be setting soon. You\u0027ll have your dinner in bed,\" he added. \"Did mi\u0027lord really throw you in the Thames?\" he asked when he thought she was about to argue with his decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"He did,\" she answered. \"And he has yet to apologize. He threw away my satchel, too. I\u0027m a pauper now,\" she added, sounding cheerful again. \"Lady Christina did give me some of her lovely clothes, though, and I thank God for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem very saddened by your current predicament,\" Sterns remarked. He opened the door to her room, then stepped back so she could pass through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t believe in being sad,\" she answered. \"Why, Sterns, what a lovely bedroom. Gold is my very favorite color. Is the coverlet made of silk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Satin,\" Sterns answered, smiling over the enthusiasm in her voice. \"May I assist you in removing your jacket, mi\u0027lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade nodded. \"Would you open the window first? It\u0027s a bit stuffy in here.\" She walked over to look outside, judging the distance to the cover of trees. Matthew and Jimbo would be waiting for her signal come darkness. They\u0027d be watching the windows for the lighted candle, the sign they\u0027d decided upon, to indicate that all was well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade turned when Sterns began to tug on her jacket. \"I shall have this cleaned for you, mi\u0027lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please,\" she answered. \"I believe there\u0027s a small tear in the side too, Sterns. Could you have someone patch it up, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns didn\u0027t answer her. Jade looked up at his face. \"Have you gone ill, sir?\" she asked. The servant was suddenly looking quite green in the complexion to her. \"Sterns, do sit down. Don\u0027t take insult, but I believe you might be in jeopardy of a swoon,\" He shook his head when she shoved him into the chair adjacent to the window. The butler finally found his voice. He shouted in a true roar for his lord to present himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was just starting up the stairs when he heard Sterns\u0027 bellow. \"Now what has she done?\" he muttered to himself. He rushed through the foyer where the servants were again lined up, passed a wave in their general direction, and then raced up the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to an abrupt stop when he reached the doorway, for the sight he came upon did surprise him. Sterns was struggling to get out of the wingback chair. Jade held him down with one hand on his shoulder. She was fanning him with a thin book she held in her other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in God\u0027s name .. . Sterns? Are you ill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone faint,\" Jade announced. \"Help me get him to the bed, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her side, mi\u0027lord,\" Sterns protested. \"Dear lady, do quit waving that book in my face. Caine, have a look at her side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine understood before Jade did. He hurried over to Jade, turned her around, and when he got a good look at the god-awful blood soaking her white blouse, he wanted to sit down, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God,\" he whispered. \"Oh, sweetheart, what happened to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade let out a loud gasp when she saw the damage. She would have staggered backward if he hadn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen holding her. \"Love, didn\u0027t you know you were bleeding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked dumbfounded. \"I didn\u0027t know. I thought it was a scratch from one of the branches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns stood on her other side. \"She\u0027s lost a fair amount of blood, mi\u0027lord,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she has,\" Caine answered, trying his best not to sound overly concerned. He didn\u0027t want her to become any more frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands shook when he gently lifted the garment away from her waistband. She noticed. \"It\u0027s bad, isn\u0027t it?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at it, sweetheart,\" he said. \"Does it hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The minute I saw all the blood, it started hurting like the devil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade noticed the tear in Christina\u0027s garment then. \"They ruined my friend\u0027s lovely top,\" she cried out. \"They bloody well shot right through it. Just look at that hole, Caine. It\u0027s the size of a ... of a ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pistol shot?\" Sterns suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine had worked the top away and was now using his knife on her chemise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s getting dotty on us,\" Sterns whispered. \"You\u0027d best put her on the bed before she swoons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll not swoon, Sterns, and you should apologize for thinking I would. Caine, please let go of me. It isn\u0027t decent to cut my clothes away. I\u0027ll take care of this injury by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was suddenly desperate to get both men out of her room. Since the moment she\u0027d seen the injury, her stomach had been in an uproar. She felt light-headed now and her knees were starting to buckle up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Sterns?\" she asked. \"Do I get my apology or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the butler was given a chance to answer, Jade said, \"Bloody hell. I am going to swoon after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade came awake with a start. She was surprised to find herself in bed, for she didn\u0027t have the faintest idea how she\u0027d gotten there. After a long moment, the truth settled in. Good God, she really had fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trying to come to terms with this humiliation when she realized the breeze coming in through the open window was cooling her bare skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes to find Sterns leaning over her from one side of the bed and Caine bending over her from the opposite side. Their deep scowls were almost enough to send her into another faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shot went clear through,\" Caine muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank the Lord for that,\" Sterns whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one of you scoundrels removed my clothing when I wasn\u0027t looking?\" she asked, her tone of voice as crisp as new frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns visibly jumped. Caine merely smiled. \"You\u0027re feeling better, mi\u0027lady?\" the butleT inquired after he\u0027d regained his composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you. Sterns? Why are you holding my hand?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To keep you still, mi\u0027lady,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may let go of me now. I won\u0027t interfere with Caine\u0027s task.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he\u0027d complied with that request, she immediately tried to push Caine\u0027s hands away from her side. \"You\u0027re prodding, Caine,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m almost finished, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice sounded terribly surly to her, yet he was being incredibly gentle, too. It was a contradiction. \"Are you angry with me, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even bother to glance up when he gave his curt answer. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could sound a little more convincing,\" she countered. \"You are angry,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand why . . .\" She paused to let out a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine assumed the bandage he was applying to her injury had caused her discomfort. \"Is it too tight?\" he asked, his gaze filled with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think this is all my fault, don\u0027t you?\" she stammered out. \"You think I deliberately . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, mi\u0027lady,\" Sterns interrupted. \"The Marquess doesn\u0027t blame you. You didn\u0027t mean to get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyourself shot. Mi\u0027lord always gets a bit...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cranky?\" she supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler nodded. \"Yes, he gets cranky when he\u0027s worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her attention back to Caine. \"I\u0027m sorry if I worried you,\" she said then. \"Are you still worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the injury isn\u0027t as terrible as it looked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. He put the finishing touches on his handiwork before giving her his full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mere flesh wound, Jade,\" he said. \"You should be up and about in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really looked as if he meant what he said. Jade was immediately relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cover my legs, Sterns, and don\u0027t look while you\u0027re doing it,\" she ordered. Her voice had regained some of its bite, warming a smile out of the dour-faced man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was wearing only her chemise now. One side of the lace-bordered garment had been torn wide to expose her injury. She understood the necessity of having her clothes removed, but now that she knew she wasn\u0027t in jeopardy of dying, appearances needed to be maintained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler did as she requested, then left to fetch a tray of supper for her. She and Caine were all alone. \"I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s only a paltry flesh wound,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve decided I\u0027m going to linger, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down on the side of the bed, took hold of her hand, and gave her a heart-stopping smile. \"Why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo I get the feeling there\u0027s more to this announcement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How astute of you, sir,\" she countered. \"There is more. While I\u0027m lingering, you\u0027re going to stay by my sick bed. This is, after all, probably all your fault,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to bite her lower lip to keep herself from laughing. Caine looked thoroughly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" he asked when she stared at him expectantly. \"How have you come to the conclusion that it\u0027s my fault?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I haven\u0027t quite figured it out yet, but I will. Now give me your word, Caine. I won\u0027t rest easy until I know you won\u0027t leave my side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, love,\" he answered. His wink was slow, devilish. \"I won\u0027t leave your side day or night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe significance in that statement wasn\u0027t lost on her. \"You may take to your own bed at night,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I?\" he asked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade decided not to goad him any further, guessing he\u0027d get downright cranky if she persisted with her orders. Besides, she\u0027d won this round, hadn\u0027t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inconvenience of getting shot was going to be turned into a nice advantage. She now had a perfectly good reason to keep him at her side. Why, she just might linger until Nathan came to fetch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t realized how exhausted she was. She fell asleep right after dinner, the tray still perched on her lap, and only awakened once during the night. Twin candles were burning a soft light on the night stand. Jade remembered the signal she needed to give to Jimbo and Matthew to let them know all was well, and immediately pushed the covers away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spotted Caine then. He was sprawled out in the wingback chair adjacent to the bed, his bare feet propped up on the bed, his white shirt opened to the waist, and was sound asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade didn\u0027t know how long she watched him. She told herself she was just making certain he was really sound asleep. Lord, he was so appealing to her. He had quickly become far more, however, than merely handsome. He was like a safe haven from the storm, and the urge to lean on him, to let him take care of her, nearly overwhelmed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer guardian angel began to snore, pulling her out of her trance. She eased out of the bed, picked up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone of the candles, and went to stand in front of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight rain cascaded down upon the landscape. Jade felt a bit guilty that her men were getting a good soaking. If she\u0027d given her signal earlier, they could have found dry shelter sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade almost dropped the candle, so startled was she by Caine\u0027s booming voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around and found him just a scant foot away. \"I was just looking out the window,\" she whispered. \"I didn\u0027t mean to wake you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair was tousled and he seemed to be more asleep than awake yet. A lock of his hair had fallen on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis forehead, giving him the appearance of being a bit vulnerable to her. Without a thought as to what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was doing, she brushed his hair back in place. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-15.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
