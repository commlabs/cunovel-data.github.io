{"id":29169,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. LIFE AT MARSHFIELD.","content":"The town of Marshfield is as intimately associated with the name of Daniel Webster as is Abbotsford with Sir Walter Scott. It is a sparsely settled town on the south-eastern shore of Massachusetts. Mr. Webster’s first acquaintance with it dates from 1824. Both Mr. and Mrs. Webster were charmed with the situation of the Thomas Farm, as it was then called, and the grand views which it afforded of the ocean. For several summers the Websters were boarders in the family of Captain Thomas, and finally, in 1831, he became the owner of the farm by purchase. Then he began to make improvements, and by the lavish expenditure of money converted it from a homely farm to a fitting residence for a famous lawyer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Henceforth this was the home to which the thoughts of the great statesman turned when, weary and exhausted with his labors in the courts, the Cabinet or the Senate, he felt the need of rest. He delighted to array himself in a farmer’s rough garb, to stride over his own fields, and look after his cattle. He had not forgotten his early tastes, and reveled in the free and unconventional life of this seaside farm. He drank in health from the invigorating sea breezes, and always bore more easily the burden of public cares after a few days at Marshfield.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I had rather be here than in the Senate,” he said on one occasion to his son, while amusing himself with feeding his cattle with ears of corn from an unhusked pile lying upon the barn floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Webster was a keen disciple of Isaac Walton, and spent many an hour with rod and line, when perhaps his thoughts were busy with some intricate political problem, or his mind was occupied with the composition of some speech now famous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To Mr. Harvey’s “Reminiscences” I am indebted for the following anecdote of Mr. Webster, and indeed for most that I have said about his country life:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Soon after Mr. Webster went to Marshfield he was one day out on the marshes shooting birds. It was in the month of August, when the farmers were securing their salt hay. He came, in the course of his rambles, to the Green Harbor River, which he wished to cross. He beckoned to one of the men on the opposite bank to take him over in his boat, which lay moored in sight. The man at once left his work, came over and paddled Mr. Webster across the stream. He declined the payment offered him, but lingered a moment, with Yankee curiosity, to question the stranger. He surmised who Mr. Webster was, and with some hesitation remarked:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘This is Daniel Webster, I believe?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘That is my name,’ replied the sportsman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘Well, now,’ said the farmer, ‘I am told that you can make from three to five dollars a day pleadin’ cases up in Boston.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mr. Webster replied that he was sometimes so fortunate as to receive that amount for his services.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘Well, now,’ returned the rustic; ‘it seems to me, I declare, if I could get as much in the city pleadin’ law cases, I would not be a wadin’ over these marshes this hot weather shootin’ little birds.’”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Had the simple countryman been told that his companion, who was dressed but little better than himself, was making from thirty to forty thousand dollars annually by these same “law cases,” we can hardly imagine the extent of his amazement, or perhaps incredulity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is a tradition, and Mr. Webster has confirmed it, that he was one day out on the marsh when his attention was drawn to two young men, evidently from the city, who were standing on one side of a creek which it seemed necessary to cross. They were nicely dressed, and evidently dismayed by the apparent necessity of spoiling their fine clothes in the passage. Seeing a large rough-looking man, with his pants tucked in his boots, approaching them, their faces brightened as they saw a way out of their dilemma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My good man,” said one, in an eager but patronizing way, “we are in trouble. Can you help us?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Webster looked at the young men and appreciated the situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He answered gravely, “What is your difficulty?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We want to get across this creek, but you see we might spoil our clothes if we undertook to wade.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Webster nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You look like a good, strong fellow, and it won’t hurt your clothes. Will you carry us across on your back?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Webster’s eyes twinkled, but he did not suffer the young men to see it. They were lightly made, and no great burden to one of his herculean frame.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” he answered; “I will oblige you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So he took the two over in turn, and deposited them, greatly to their satisfaction, safe and sound on the opposite shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m ever so much obliged,” said the first. “Here, my man, take this,” and he drew half a dollar from his pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The second made the same tender.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are quite welcome, young gentlemen,” said Mr. Webster, “but I can’t think of accepting any recompense.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Really, though, it’s worth it; isn’t it, Jones?” said the first young man, addressing his companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Of course it is. Better take the money, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I must decline,” said Mr. Webster, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ever so much obliged. Really it’s very kind of you. By the way, doesn’t Daniel Webster live round here somewhere?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes; you are on his land now,” said the rough-looking countryman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You don’t say so. Is there any chance of seeing him, do you think?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A very good chance. You have only to take a good look at me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Are—you—Mr.—Webster?” faltered the young men simultaneously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Men call me so,” answered the statesman, enjoying the confusion of the young men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They attempted to apologize for the liberty they had taken, and the great mistake they had made, but without much success, and notwithstanding the good-natured manner in which their excuses were received by Mr. Webster, were glad when they were out of his presence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I cannot resist the temptation to record another amusing incident in the summer life of Mr. Webster. One day he had gone to Chelsea Beach to shoot wild fowl. While lying among the tall grass he watched from his concealment the flocks of birds as they flew over the beach and adjacent waters. A flock appeared flying quite low, and he lowered the muzzle of his gun below the horizontal range to bring the birds before his eye. He fired, and instantly there was a loud cry proceeding from the beach below. In alarm Mr. Webster rushed down the bank, and descried a stranger rubbing his face and shoulder ruefully. The sportsman himself was not looking his best. His raiment was disordered and his face was begrimed with powder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My dear sir,” he inquired anxiously, “did I hit you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man answered resentfully, “Yes, you did hit me; and, from your looks, I should think that I am not the first man you have shot, either.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1669/49226.html","bookId":1192,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:20:26 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:20:26 AM"}
