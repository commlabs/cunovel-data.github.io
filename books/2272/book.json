She survived for two months as the prisoner of a deranged killer. Now a new menace is stalking the streets of New York. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe media is buzzing about the Poe Killings, a string of homicides mirroring the author\u0027s macabre stories. Almost without exception, the victims have been members of a literary society devoted to the master of crime fiction--and Genevieve s own mother may be next. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSpooked by the bizarre slayings, Genevieve turns to PI Joe Connolly, her rescuer, her friend and...? She wants him to be much more, but he\u0027s been avoiding her since her ordeal, and she can\u0027t seem to get close to him. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eJoe isn\u0027t sure there even is a case. But as the body count rises and their investigation leads them miles from Manhattan, he has to admit that there\u0027s a twisted new serial killer at work. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eEven more unsettling is the guidance Joe is receiving from beyond the grave. People he knows to be dead--his cousin Matt and Matt\u0027s fiancÃ©e Leslie--are appearing to him, offering new clues and leads, and warning him of terrible danger ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut not even otherworldly intervention can keep Genevieve and Joe\u0027s new nightmare from becoming terrifyingly real--and putting them squarely in the crosshairs between this world and the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-death-dealer-harrison-investigation-6.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-death-dealer-harrison-investigation-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:58 PM"}
