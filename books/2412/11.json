{"id":75261,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eEven after a handful of years, Duncan found meetings weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole business-suited, proposal/pitch/report, Danish-and-coffee and thanks-for-your-time elements of them. Then there were the politics, and the pecking orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was why he didn\u0027t have an actual office. There was no escaping the meeting to his mind if a man had an office. Plus an office meant you had to staff it with people who had to be given particular assignments on a regular basis. If you happened to be the boss, that meant you had to come up with those assignments, and probably read reams of reports on the assignments before, during and afterward. And you\u0027d damn well have to have more meetings regarding the assignments. Vicious cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn office involved desks, and giving people titles. Who actually decided on titles? What made, say, an executive assistant different from an administrative assistant? And should it be the Vice President of Marketing and Sales, or the Vice President of Sales and Marketing? Things like that would keep him up at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhineas nagged him off and on about the office thing, but so far he\u0027d been able to slip and slide around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked meeting with people in one of the bars, or a restaurant. Or if it was absolutely necessary, in Phin\u0027s office, which was, in Duncan\u0027s opinion, meeting central. Going somewhere that wasn\u0027t essentially or absolutely his own place not only kept things looser, but he\u0027d found those he met with tended to be more up-front and outspoken over a beer in a pub than they might be over glasses of spring water in a boardroom. He\u0027d found, too, that it was often more interesting, certainly more telling, to go to the prospective meeter. Sitting in their homes, their place of business, their studio, whatever, generally made them more comfortable. It gave him a leg up on getting what he wanted or needed or hoped for if the other party was comfortable in their own space. Following that philosophy, he\u0027d buzzed from a breakfast meeting at a cafe downtown to a funky little theater in Southside, then wound his way to a sadly neglected house in the Victorian section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each case, he felt he\u0027d gotten more accomplished, and had a better time of it, than if he\u0027d summoned all the parties involved in all the prospective projects into some stuffy office where he\u0027d be stuck behind a desk wanting to pull a Suicide Joe and jump out the window anyway. As he made the turn onto Jones, he hoped the same would hold true for what he\u0027d deemed his last meeting of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d considered timing it differently, doing a kind of drop-by when Phoebe would be home. But that seemed just a little underhanded. Which was a valid strategy, true, but he figured she\u0027d cop to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked, began the pretty stroll under arching trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to see her-and not just for the quick just-dropping-intosee-how-you\u0027re-doing visits he\u0027d limited himself to for the last two weeks. Biding time, he mused. And maybe there was a little gameplaying in there, too. She didn\u0027t know what to make of him, and he didn\u0027t mind that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t always know what to make of himself, and didn\u0027t mind that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing he did know was that she\u0027d had a major trauma, and she was working her way through it. There wasn\u0027t any point in pushing her into a date, or rushing her into bed at a time when she was shaky on her pins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had plans. He liked to make plans, nearly as much as he liked adjusting, shifting and altogether changing them from conception to completion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had plans for Phoebe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, he had plans for something else altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he turned up the walk to MacNamara House he spotted the woman with the strange little dog across the brick road. Today\u0027s doggy bow tie was red-and-white-striped, to match the wide-brimmed hat the lady had perched on her head. It set off, he supposed, her blindingly white suit and red sneakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little dog currently sniffed happily, by all appearances, at the butt of a puffy pink poodle held on the end of a gold leash by an enormously fat black man in a blue seersucker suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scrawny lady and the huge man chatted away under the shade of a live oak even as the hairless dog struggled mightily to hump the pink poodle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, Duncan thought, he loved Savannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rang the bell, admired the pots and baskets of flowers on the veranda while he waited. It was Ava, he remembered, who had the gardening talent. He wondered if he could talk her into...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" He offered Essie a smile when she opened the door. \"Got time for a bad penny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re no bad penny, and I\u0027ve always got time for young handsome men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d progressed over his occasional visits to cheek-kissing. He bussed hers now, caught the subtle scent of her perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it like, he wondered, to get up every day, dress and groom, knowing you\u0027d never go out the door?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you know I was baking cookies?\" she asked him, so his smile spread to a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chocolate chip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, really? All the way from scratch? Good thing I came by so you\u0027d have a taste tester.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get you started on that. Phoebe won\u0027t be home for a couple hours yet,\" she added as she led the way back. \"Ava, she\u0027s running errands. She\u0027ll be swinging by school to pick Carly up after play practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Carly\u0027s one of the wicked stepsisters in Cinderella. She loves getting to be mean and bossy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a frog once. Not the turn-into-a-prince kind. Just a frog. I had to belch on cue. It was a shining moment in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, shooed him toward the kitchen table. \"I bet your mama was so proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing to that. What could he say? Instead he sniffed the air. \"Smells like heaven in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got some still warm from the oven. You want coffee or milk with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cookies and milk? I\u0027d suffer through school again if I could come home after to you and cookies and milk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleased, she pinked up. \"You\u0027re a charmer, aren\u0027t you? What\u0027ve you been out and about doing today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talking to people, mostly. And actually, I was hoping to finish up that part of the day talking to you. There\u0027s this property I was looking at. It\u0027s in the Victorian District, not far from a piece of the campus. Savannah College of Art and Design?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t say.\" She could barely remember what was outside the house and where it was set. All of that, the streets and buildings and open spaces, were a jumbled maze of squares and lines in her mind. \"What kind of property?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of a mess, actually. Like one of those Victorian ladies who fell on extremely hard times. You can still see the elegance under the neglect.\" He picked up a cookie, bit in. Then forgot everything in pure sensory pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God. Marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t laugh this time. She giggled. \"If a woman can have you for a cookie, I\u0027m surprised the bakeries all over the state of Georgia aren\u0027t working overtime.\" She reached across him, picked up one herself. And her eyes twinkled. \"But they are damned good cookies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I beg, will you give me some to take home? How can I settle for Chips Ahoy! now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe we can spare some for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to the stove to take out a tray, slide in the one she\u0027d prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost my train of thought in cookie nirvana. This sad house off campus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm-hmm. You\u0027re thinking of buying it and fixing it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed warm cookie with cold milk, and figured that was the sum total of heaven on earth. \"That kind of depends on you.\" Puzzlement lifted her eyebrows as she turned away from the stove. \"On me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of buying it and fixing it up, yeah. What I\u0027ve got in mind is a shop. Now... \" He gestured with the last bite of the first cookie before popping it into his mouth. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t possibly. I\u0027m too confused to be thinking anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, what some might think is, hell, Savannah\u0027s got a million shops already. It does, no doubt about it. But people love to shop. No doubt about that either. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I do. I love browsing the Internet shops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" He picked up another cookie. \"So I\u0027m thinking, location being near the campus, Art and Design. Why not art, crafts. Okay,\" he said before she could speak. \"We\u0027ve already got plenty of shops and galleries. Artsy, crafty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I... suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even the style I\u0027m thinking, which would be upscale, isn\u0027t new, particularly. Boutiquey. Boutiquesque? You know what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost.\" She shook her head, laughed again. \"Duncan, if you\u0027re using me for a sounding board here, I\u0027m flattered. But I don\u0027t know anything about real estate and location and boutiquey shops out there. I don\u0027t go out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know about art and craft.\" Okay, he was having a third cookie, even if it made him sick. \"About creating it. About selling it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean my crocheting.\" She waved a hand at him. \"That\u0027s just a paying hobby. It\u0027s just something I stumbled into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. How about stumbling my way? I\u0027ve got this idea. Don\u0027t you love getting ideas? I always got ideas, but I couldn\u0027t do anything with most of them. Now I can. It\u0027s a rush, let me tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The idea is arts and crafts by Savannahians. Products created only in Savannah. Only Savannah,\" he repeated, narrowing his eyes. \"Might be a good name for it. I should write that down. Savannah arts and crafts,\" he continued as he dug out his cell phone, cued up his memo function. \"Created by Savannahians, displayed and sold in a gorgeous two-story wooden house that symbolizes Savannah. It\u0027s got this great porch, or it will be great. I know this guy who does amazing furniture. Tongue and groove. And this woman who does amazing things with wrought iron. So we could... getting ahead of myself,\" he said when he noted she was just staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to carry some of my crocheting in your shop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Essie, I want to carry buckets of it, trunkloads of it. I want to have it spread all through the place. What do you call them-doilies?-on tables, throws on the sofas. You said you did bedspreads, right? How about tablecloths, like that? And clothes. Sweaters, scarves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes, b u\u0027t... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, we\u0027d have rooms set up. Just like a home. Bedrooms, dining room, parlors. So we\u0027d display your work that way. For sale, sure, but also part of the ambience, you know? Baby stuff in the nursery, scarves, sweaters in the wardrobes. You could keep doing your own Internet sales if you want. But we could take care of that for you, expand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My head is actually spinning.\" She laid her hand on one side of it as if to keep it centered. \"Why do you think I could do all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are doing it. You\u0027d just keep doing it-except for the boxing and shipping, depending on how you want to handle it. Here, come with me a minute.\" He grabbed her hand as he pushed back from the table, pulled her into the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you call that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned at the long runner she\u0027d designed in soft pastels for the dining room table. \"A runner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A runner. Got it. So, if you were to make one just like that and sell it, what would you charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well.\" She had to calculate. She\u0027d made one very similar for a client once, and several shorter ones for others over the years. She gauged the price as best she could without a calculator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan nodded, did some rapid calculations of his own. \"I could give you fifteen percent more than that, and still make a decent profit.\" Her cheeks went white, then flushed warm pink. \"Fifteen percent more?\" She grabbed an end of the runner. \"You want it now? I\u0027ll box it right up for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You keep that one, and start thinking about making more. And whatever else you\u0027ve a mind to make. I\u0027m going to need some time to get this up and running, but I guarantee we\u0027ll be rocking by the Christmas shopping season.\" He held out a hand. \"Partner?\" Duncan considered it a really good day if by seven, regardless of what had come before, there was pizza and beer on the veranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d lit candles, as much to discourage the bugs as to add some light. His bare feet were propped on the padded wicker hassock. He\u0027d left the TV on in the living room, angling himself so he could watch some basketball action through the window if he wanted. Or just listen to the play-by-play and stare off into the soft dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had enough of people for the day. As sociable as he was, he hoarded his alone time. And he liked to listen to the sounds of the game, but he just simply loved the sounds of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quiet swooshing of air through the trees, the hum of insects, the incessant music of peepers entertained him. It was a good spotveranda, chair and hassock-and the best time of day to figure things out. Or to let them go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been tempted to hang out in Essie\u0027s kitchen until Phoebe came in from work. So why hadn\u0027t he? Hang around too much, he decided, and become a fixture. Or an annoyance. It was all a matter of balance, to his way of thinking. And intriguing the woman in question so maybe she was just a little off hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, every time he saw her, he wanted to grab her. Considering what she\u0027d been through, he didn\u0027t think she was at the grabbing stage yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished off a slice of pizza, contemplated another. Then glanced over at the sound of a car. His brows lifted when he realized the car wasn\u0027t passing by but heading in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t recognize it, but he recognized the woman who stepped out of it. And this, he thought, was a better way to end the day than pizza and beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Phoebe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan.\" She pushed at her hair as she walked to the veranda. \"I was at the bridge before it occurred to me you probably weren\u0027t here, and then it was too late not to keep going. But here you are anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here a lot. I mostly live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want some pizza? A beer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and no. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe formal tone had him lifting his eyebrows again. \"How about a chair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, thanks. I want to ask what you\u0027re doing with my mother.\" Okay. \"Well, I asked her to marry me, but she avoided giving me an answer. I don\u0027t think she took me seriously so I settled for the cookies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wondering how seriously you take her, or yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you tell me why you\u0027re pissed at me, and we\u0027ll go from there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not pissed. I\u0027m concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullshit, he thought. He knew a pissed-off woman when she was standing on his veranda ready to chew holes in him. \"About?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother\u0027s bursting with excitement over this business you talked to her about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want her to be excited?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want her to be disappointed, or disillusioned or hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was as cool as his neglected beer. \"Which would be the natural consequence of excitement over the project we discussed. Which, as I recall,\" he added, \"doesn\u0027t involve you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother\u0027s state of mind very much involves me. You can\u0027t come in there talking about some store you\u0027re thinking of opening in some house you\u0027re thinking of buying, and how she\u0027s going to be a part of it. It\u0027s your business how you do business-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" Phoebe ground out. \"You got her all worked up, making plans, making designs, talking about how she\u0027ll be able to help more with the expenses. What happens to all that if you change your mind, or it doesn\u0027t come through, or you just find something more interesting to play with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I change my mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the one who opened a sports bar, then sold it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sold a piece of it,\" he corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then a pub. And I don\u0027t know what else.\" Which was the crux of it. She didn\u0027t know, and he was taking her mother into territory she hadn\u0027t mapped out. \"You bounce, and that\u0027s fine for you, Duncan, that\u0027s just fine. It\u0027s not fine for my mother. She doesn\u0027t bounce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me sort this out. In your opinion, I\u0027m irresponsible and unreliable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No.\" She let out a sigh as the leading edge of her temper dulled down to the core of worry. \"You\u0027re casual, Duncan, and it\u0027s part of your appeal. You can afford to be casual, and not just because of the money. No one depends on you, so you can do what you like, come and go as you please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that casual or careless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say what I mean, and I said casual. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re careless. But my mother\u0027s fragile, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother\u0027s amazing. You know, I told her once she ought to give herself a break, but the fact is, you ought to give her one. Do you think because she can\u0027t go out of that house, she\u0027s less than amazing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Damn it, no.\" Because the conversation, such as it was, had gotten out of her hands, Phoebe dragged them through her hair and tried to get back to center. \"But she does. She\u0027s been hurt and pushed and shoved into the corner so many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to do any of those things to Essie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on purpose. I don\u0027t mean that. But what if, for whatever reason, you don\u0027t buy that house, then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought it today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped her. That put a hitch in her stride, Duncan thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing more, just picked up his beer, watched her as he tipped back the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, you bought the house. But what if you find it isn\u0027t cost effective to fix it up? Or what if-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus. What if the voices tell me to put on fairy wings and fly to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuba? You can \u0027what if till next Tuesday; it doesn\u0027t mean a damn. I finish what I start, goddamn it. I\u0027m not stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not stupid. I never said or meant you were.\" But someone had, someone that mattered. \"It\u0027s just that this all came out of the blue, and for my mother it\u0027s huge. I\u0027m trying to point out the variables, and I\u0027m trying to understand why you\u0027d involve her in this. I can\u0027t understand what you\u0027re doing. I can\u0027t understand what you want. From her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tied those two together,\" he muttered, and pushed to his feet. \"Must want something from you, so I use her. Let\u0027s answer this first. You want to know what I want from you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Let\u0027s start there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her before the last word was all the way out. The hell with biding time. He was too pissed off to bide anything. He had his mouth on hers, showing her what he wanted, taking what he wanted with an impatient anger he rarely let free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunger pushed and shoved at temper until his mouth ravaged hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer back pressed back against the porch column, and her hands were trapped between his body and hers. Every muscle in her body quivered. But not in protest, not in fear. There was a difference between fear and thrill, and she understood it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he broke off, there was such heat in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got that now?\" he demanded. \"We\u0027re clear on that point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her move now. All hers. Her hands were free so she hooked one arm around his neck, yanked his mouth back to hers. She would have chained her arms around him if her injured shoulder had allowed. When he pressed her against the column again, she nipped at his lip, rocked her hips against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let the pleasure flood her after months and months of sexual drought. The feel of his hands on her breasts, the feel of the night air on her skin when his busy fingers undid her shirt, unhooked her bra. The glorious sensation that rolled through her and escaped on a purring moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went wet and needy, arching to his hands and his mouth, quivering, quivering when he tugged at the button of her waistband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, standing right here, she wanted to be taken without thought, without care, without boundaries. Desperate, she reached for him. And the shock of pain in her shoulder had her crying out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked back as if she\u0027d punched him. \"Christ. Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right. I moved wrong, that\u0027s all. Don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he held up a hand, turned away. He paced up, he paced down. Stopped and took a long, long gulp of his warming beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hurt. You\u0027re still hurt. Jesus.\" And, setting the beer down again, he scrubbed his hands over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that bad. Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still hurt. And I\u0027m not going to bang you against the post like... Okay, okay, another minute here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced up and down again. \"You pissed me off. No real excuse but I\u0027m taking it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No excuses necessary as it was obviously mutual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regardless. Anyway, that should answer the question, which I\u0027m still trying to exactly remember as all the blood\u0027s drained out of my head. The second had to do with...\" He\u0027d turned to face her again, and just stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, leaning back against the post, shirt open, hair tumbled, cheeks flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. Seriously. Hold on,\" he said when she glanced down, then began to button up. \"Would you not do that for just another minute. Maybe two? Since I\u0027m not allowed to touch, it seems only fair I be able to look. You\u0027ve got this really terrific body. It\u0027s all just... just exactly right. And the way you\u0027re standing there, and this light, and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, yeah, you better close up shop there. That\u0027s about all I can handle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a strange man, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard that. I want you, and it\u0027s keeping me up at night. I don\u0027t mind that so much, even though I like to sleep. But some things rate insomnia. You\u0027re one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But to get back to the rest. I think the point\u0027s just been made that I don\u0027t need to use Essie to get to you. And you know what? You should think more of her than that. More of me, too, and more of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. You\u0027re absolutely right, and I\u0027m absolutely wrong. I hate that. My excuse, since we\u0027re using them, is I love her so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get that. You\u0027re lucky to have her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe raked a hand through her hair. He meant that, exactly that, she realized. He saw her mother, and saw the value of the woman she was. \"I know it. People, a lot of people, look at the situation and think she\u0027s some sort of burden. You don\u0027t. And I\u0027m sorry for the way I handled this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be, too, except I got my hands on your breasts.\" She laughed. \"Want that beer now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better not, I\u0027m driving. Duncan, please don\u0027t take this the wrong way. I see the bars-you tended bar. And I could see if you bought a cab company, or a car service or some such thing. Maybe you have, I don\u0027t know, and that\u0027s part of it. I don\u0027t know how you do this sort of thing. And I don\u0027t know what you could possibly know about running a retail craft boutique.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find out, plus I wouldn\u0027t actually be running it. I\u0027ve got somebody in mind for that. And you\u0027re thinking, hell, he can afford to lose a couple hundred thousand here or there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, actually, I was thinking you\u0027ll probably find a way to make it work. I\u0027m thinking I was scared because I came home to find my mother happy, bubbling with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was happy when she started with Reuben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Phoebe pressed her fingers to her eyes. \"Obviously I didn\u0027t connect those dots for myself before I came haring out here and laid into you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hair trigger,\" he said, without heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About some things, obviously. Now that I\u0027ve connected those dots-or you have for me-I\u0027m thinking if you hadn\u0027t had this idea I can\u0027t understand, exactly, my mother wouldn\u0027t have a chance to try something exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have made the offer if I didn\u0027t believe I could sell the sheer hell out of her work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which, if I hadn\u0027t flown off, I\u0027d have come around to on my own rather than driving out here to jump all over you. Which I don\u0027t regret because you got to get your hands on my breasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled slowly. \"How long before they think you\u0027ll be a hundred percent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached up with her good arm to touch his hair. She liked how it always looked as if he\u0027d just taken a wild ride in that fancy car of his. \"I\u0027ll get a note from my private duty nurse clearing me for physical activity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Works for me. Meanwhile, how about going out with me Sunday? Sunday-afternoon barbecue at a friend\u0027s. It\u0027d be a chance to get to know each other, dynamics with others, before we lose ourselves in wild, sweaty sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pick you up about two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two. I need to get home.\" She rose to her toes, kissed him, softly, slowly, on either cheek. \"I hope I keep you up tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her walk away, flick a killer smile over her shoulder. And decided the odds were heavily in favor of insomnia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her car drove away, he went back to sit, to prop his feet on the padded hassock. Eating cold pizza, drinking warm beer, he thought it had been a hell of an interesting day. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-11.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
