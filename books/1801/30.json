She felt it as intensely as if it were her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are my Shield Lady. We are bound together until death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words vibrated inside her head. Sariana closed her eyes, unable to question this new, strange manner of hearing. She understood nothing in this moment except the feeling of being completely and totally possessed. Even that sensation seemed to be working the same way as the shared pain, she realized. It reverberated between herself and Gryph. They were like mirrors for each other. Sensation bounced back and forth, growing more intense with each reflection. The light from that mirror scattered into countless rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana not only felt herself possessed, she was some-\"how also the possessor. She held Gryph just as he held her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime hung still for an endless moment in the darkened bed chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with agonizing slowness, the savagely disorienting sensations calmed. The unnatural pain faded and took on more normal dimensions, as if she and Gryph were each reclaiming that which was legitimately their own discomfort and freeing the other of the added burden. Even the branding sensation in Sariana\u0027s palm began to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be all right, Shield Lady. The worst is over.\" Gryph pulled her hand away from the weapon kit and folded her throbbing palm within his. Then he kissed her trembling fingers. \"I swear to you, Sariana, I had no idea it would be that violent. The link between us must be very, very strong. I\u0027ve never beard of a mating such as this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gryph, I don\u0027t understand any of this.\" Sariana\u0027s mouth was so dry she could hardly get the words out. The initial, painful sensations that had gripped her were almost gone, but the sense of disorientation was taking longer to fade. And one particular focus of discomfort had not yet returned to normal. Gryph was still sheathed deeply within her body and she was intensely aware of every centimeter of his invading shaft. Her body felt unbearably tight and stretched as it sought to accommodate his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, my sweet.\" Gryph was trying to speak soothingly, but his voice was still tight from his unreleased sexual tension. \"I know. It\u0027s over now. I\u0027ll explain everything to you in the morning. But now you and I have some unfinished business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana winced as he began to move within her. The pain had diminished, but she still felt overly sensitized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gryph, I don\u0027t want - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, Sariana. No more words. Not now.\" He continued to stroke gently in and out of her warmth. \"Let yourself relax and respond. There is so much passion waiting to be released within you. I think the linking was all the more painful partly because of that passion. We are going to be very good together, you and I. Damn good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana was not so certain of that, but her body seemed to be accepting him now, albeit somewhat unwillingly. She still felt stretched far too tightly, but the sensation was not as uncomfortable as it had been. In fact, it was oddly exciting. She tightened her hold on Gryph, preparing to let herself explore this new, more pleasant feeling. Her legs wrapped around his waist in an unconscious need to get closer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sensual movements had a totally unexpected effect on him. Gryph lost his control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sariana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched forward, surging deeply into her as his whole body went taut. Gryph stifled a shout of triumphant release and then he shuddered and collapsed on top of Sariana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes passed and Gryph did not move. Sariana stroked his warm back slowly, not certain what to do next. He seemed to be in a deep sleep. Then she became aware once more of the heat in him. He was still feverish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, carefully she wriggled out from under Gryph\u0027s heavy body. He didn\u0027t stir. She slid toward the edge of the bed. Her hand brushed the weapon kit as she did so. She jerked her fingers back reflexively and then realized there was no longer any burning sensation coming from the prisma lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana got to her feet and nearly fell over. She was weak and dizzy and every muscle in her body seemed to have turned to liquid. Turning, she glanced down at the bed. Gryph would be cold by morning. She fumbled with the quilt and managed to cover him with it. Then she checked his wound to make certain it had not started bleeding. The bandages appeared clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana quietly picked up her clothes and pulled them on. It was fortunate that the hallway outside would probably be empty. She could make it to her own suite without being seen. She opened the door and let herself out of the room. A moment later she was safely in her own chambers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she closed the door behind her a small, slithering sound made her look down. The scarlet-toe was making its way toward her across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana laughed shakily and bent down to scoop it up. \"I don\u0027t know why I bother to keep you in a cage, Lucky. It\u0027s obvious you\u0027re too smart to stay trapped in one. Are you sure you wouldn\u0027t like to be free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarlet-toe leaped from her hand to her shoulder and curled happily into her warmth. Sariana looked at her bedraggled reflection in the mirror. Her gown was drooping, her hair was tangled and her eyes were huge and shadowed. The lizard looked like a brilliant scarlet jewel on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s too late for you to be free, just as Gryph said,\" Sariana whispered. But it was her own reflection she was studying as she spoke, not the lizard\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor better or worse, she seemed to have embarked on an affair with the Shield lord. She wondered if it might be better to limit the event to a one-night stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana wasn\u0027t sure she could survive another night in Gryph\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vivid dawn light awakened Gryph the next morning. He lay still for a moment absorbing the knowledge that he was alone in his bed. Then he sat up slowly, wincing at the ache in his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll things considered, he was not particularly surprised to find Sariana gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a wedding night, last night had bordered on being a complete disaster. The groom had been clumsy from be-.ginning to end and had fallen asleep immediately after the main event. The bride had undoubtedly been traumatized by the pain for which she had been totally unprepared. She certainly had not gotten any satisfaction from the encounter. On top of everything else, Gryph suspected Sariana didn\u0027t even realize she was married. He\u0027d been too groggy from the medic\u0027s painkiller to explain the law of the First Generation Pact to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made his way into the antechamber that held a huge sunken tub, a sink and other assorted necessities. He needed several of those necessities this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tub in Gryph\u0027s chamber was fashioned to resemble a grotto, complete with its own waterfall and a collection of vivid green plants. He turned the bird-headed spigot that set the waterfall in action and then stepped underneath the hot water. Deep in the basement of the Avylyn household vapor heaters kept plenty o–à hot water available at all times. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-30.html","bookId":1801,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM"}
