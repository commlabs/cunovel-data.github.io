{"id":84874,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003eI came out of my own warm bathroom, toweling my wet hair, just as Cara had dried hers. Only Phillip\u0027s presence in the house was keeping Robin from waiting in here in my bedroom, and oddly, I was glad of that. I needed a few more seconds to myself, more than my quick shower had afforded. I was warm now, and with the heat turned up in the house, my hair would dry fairly quickly. Short of sticking me in the oven, Phillip and Robin had done everything they possibly could to warm me up. This had been tremendously important to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t suppress a snigger as I thought of how they\u0027d competed with each other to be the most solicitous. That wouldn\u0027t last long, of course, and they\u0027d be back to their more normal selves shortly, but I would enjoy it while it lasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027d just discovered I had a whole new set of worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have gotten dressed again. I wasn\u0027t an invalid. But I felt like putting on a nightgown and bathrobe, so I did. I hadn\u0027t been hurt, but I was exhausted and achy. I\u0027d actually thrown up after I\u0027d come out of the pool. I\u0027d found this acutely embarrassing, but none of the law-enforcement personnel had seemed to think much of it. They were quite busy dealing with their own embarrassment, Arthur Smith. No matter how we glossed over it, Arthur had been mooning around Poppy\u0027s house when he shouldn\u0027t have been, and Arthur had kicked a suspect. Oh, he said Cara had tried to get up and attack me again, and I\u0027d nodded weakly when they asked me if that was so, but I could tell they didn\u0027t believe us, especially Cathy Trumble. Besides, Arthur was in a peculiar mental state, and there was no disguising that, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCathy Trumble had questioned me intently for about thirty minutes, until it became obvious that I had to get into dry clothes. She sent me home in a patrol car, with the warning that she was going to come by within a couple of hours to take a full statement from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara had gone off to the hospital under guard. I pitied the officer who had to call her husband. Dr. Stuart Embler was going to be pretty unhappy with anyone who\u0027d arrested his wife. He could afford the best lawyers, too. Bringing Cara to trial might be a struggle; I\u0027d have to testify in court, if it came to a trial. I figured I wouldn\u0027t count on that until it happened. If there\u0027s one thing television has taught Americans, it\u0027s that justice doesn\u0027t always move at the pace, or in the direction, that it should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy black glasses were somewhere at the bottom of the Emblers\u0027 pool. I got my tortoiseshell ones and pushed them up the bridge of my nose. With a brush in my hand, wrapped in my favorite golden brown gown and robe, I wandered out into the den. To my surprise, Robin was there by himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Phillip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent him to the store for some Epsom salts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Epsom salts? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the only thing I could think of that you didn\u0027t already have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the need to get Phillip out of the way? Don\u0027t you like him?\" I was pretty anxious about this, since I wasn\u0027t sure at all that my dad meant to get Phillip back right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. I just wanted to be alone with you for a little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to take him very long to get Epsom salts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did also mention that if he wanted to stop by the Finstermeyers\u0027 house to tell Josh why he couldn\u0027t come over for supper tonight, I was sure that would be better than calling him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said cautiously. \"So, here we are, by ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin was beginning to wilt around the edges. \"Don\u0027t you want to have some alone time? So I can just sit and hold you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably Phillip is old enough to understand that you might want to hug me or cuddle me from time to time.\" I said this with an absolutely straight face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Robin was looking really downcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what I\u0027d like for you to do is come get on the bed with me and hold me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brightened considerably. \"Sure. I understand you\u0027re tired and upset. I just want to be next to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin five minutes, we were snuggled up in my big bed, Robin in his T-shirt and jeans, and I in my gown. I pulled a quilt up over us. I would have been utterly content if I hadn\u0027t had one long bridge to cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lying with my head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat. I was hoping that heart was feeling extra large today. I might be taxing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, started to speak, let it out. I was just a big chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robin,\" I began. Then I stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" I said, and didn\u0027t get any further. It was the second time today I\u0027d been terrified. My eyes were focused on the pattern of the quilt - oddly enough, it was the Wedding Ring. I didn\u0027t dare look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to tell me about the kit on the bathroom counter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw it when I started your bathwater. Did you use it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis big hand reached over and rested lightly on my pelvis. \"Are you...\" his voice broke. \"Are you carrying our child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stole a look up at his face. It was radiant. If he had smiled any wider, his face would have cracked. My own heart gave a leap, and I felt my whole body relax against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to be an unwed mother,\" he said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother fear discarded. I was far too traditional to face single parenthood with equanimity. All at once, I felt lighter than air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, naturally, being so happy, I started crying. \"Not just because of the baby,\" I said, \"don\u0027t marry me just for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know it\u0027s not just because of the baby.\" He scrambled out of the bed and rummaged around in the pockets of his jacket. He dove back under the covers and pressed a little velvet box into my hand. \"Proof,\" he said triumphantly. \"I\u0027ve been carrying this with me for two weeks, trying to find the right moment to ask you if you\u0027ll wear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated before opening the box. I thought of the past few days. \"It\u0027s hard to believe anything can end this well,\" I said. I didn\u0027t want to ruin the moment, but I was plagued by the deceptions of my sister-in-law. She had lied to everyone, offering each of us in her life just a little glimpse of one facet of her true character. In the end, she had become so splintered, she could not present a coherent whole to anyone. Maybe Poppy had lost her core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" I said to Robin. \"And I\u0027m proud that you\u0027re the father of my baby.\" It was an incredible feeling, hearing myself saying the words I\u0027d never believed I\u0027d get to say to anyone. I opened the box, to see a lovely yellow diamond with clear tiny ones set around it. The ring was small and delicate, and I thought it was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Sis! What\u0027s for supper?\" Phillip yelled from the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned, then rested my head against Robin\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lest the moment get too tender and mushy,\" Robin said, but he didn\u0027t sound angry. He sounded tolerant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be fine,\" I said bravely, and tried to call up a mental list of what was in the refrigerator. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/poppy-done-to-death-aurora-teagarden-8/page-14.html","bookId":2243,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:45 PM"}
