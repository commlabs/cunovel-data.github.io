Seth was playing \"patience\" with a very old and very greasy pack of cards. Sally was doing her best to mend her baby\u0027s clothes; she was as yet but an indifferent workgirl with the needle. It was not an unpleasant sight to see her taking her stitches, with knitted brow, and pursed-up lips, as though the fate of an empire was in the balance every time she dug her needle in and drew it out again. She had commenced the battle of life very early, but she had put on her armour with great cheerfulness and contentment, and was perhaps at the present moment the happiest little girl in Rosemary Lane. Her baby was asleep on the ground, comfortably covered over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m beginning to be bothered in my mind,\" said Seth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sally, ready for the bestowal of sympathy, looked up from her work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About what?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Many things. That trance of yours, to begin with. It didn\u0027t go far enough. Now, I ask you, as a prophetess--do you consider it an out-and-out prophecy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The grave air he assumed would have deceived a much riper intellect than Sally\u0027s. She prepared to discuss the matter seriously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It all come true, Mr. Dumbrick.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt of that--here you are in proof of it, and there\u0027s your father in the hospital, and there\u0027s your mother managing the workhouse in the country. It was good enough as far as it went, but it has come to an end already, and there\u0027s no more to look forward to. That\u0027s what I call not satisfactory.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mr. Dumbrick?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Sally Chester. The spirits that came to Joanna when she went off that way beat Pharaoh hollow. He couldn\u0027t hold a candle to \u0027em.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Much distressed by this depreciatory criticism, Sally said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was Pharer\u0027s first go, Mr. Dumbrick. Perhaps he wasn\u0027t quite up to the business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the life of him Seth could not repress a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s something in that, Sally. Practice makes perfect, sure. Now, you couldn\u0027t sole and heel a pair o\u0027 boots the first time of asking; but you\u0027d manage it in a year or two, with plenty of teaching. But about those spirits of Joanna\u0027s; they told all sorts o\u0027 things about the future, and they were always at it. And Joanna lived to be an old woman, and to the last day of her life she kept trancing away. Now, you\u0027ve only had one trance, Sally.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Mr. Dumbrick,\" assented Sally, with a troubled mind, \"only one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And it doesn\u0027t seem likely that you\u0027ll have another.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it does--yes, it does. I\u0027ve felt it coming on more than once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How does it feel, Sally?\" inquired Seth, with an open chuckle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A kind o\u0027 creepy like, and everything going round.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That sounds well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it you want to know, Mr. Dumbrick?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, there\u0027s baby, Sally. She won\u0027t be a baby all her life. She\u0027ll grow up to be a woman--so will you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sally nodded, and listened with all her soul in her ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She has no name except Baby, and it stands to reason that that won\u0027t do all along. We must find something else to call her by; it won\u0027t be fair to her otherwise, and she wouldn\u0027t thank us for it when she grows up. It\u0027d never do to have her grow up ungrateful, and to fly at us for not giving her what everybody else has got.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! no--never, never! But she\u0027ll love us always--you\u0027ll see if she won\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you set your mind too much on it. Perhaps our baby\u0027ll see somebody by-and-by that she\u0027ll love better than you or me, and then we shall go to the wall. We\u0027re like fiddles, Sally, and Nature\u0027s the fiddler, and plays on us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Open-eyed, and mentally as well as physically wide awake, Sally listened without exactly understanding, but dimly conscious that something very fine was being propounded to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There are not many strings in us, Sally, but, Lord! the number o\u0027 tunes that Nature plays on us! And we go through life dancing to \u0027em, or hobbling to \u0027em, as the case may be. As this little picture\u0027ll do, according to the kind of music that comes to her. As for what takes place when Nature\u0027s played her last tune on us, that\u0027s beyond you and me, Sally.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Mr. Dumbrick,\" assented Sally, feeling it incumbent upon her to say something, but groping now in such dark depths that she saw no way out of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seth\u0027s next utterances, however, brought a little light to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In all that, there are certain things--not many--that we may fairly take credit for. You\u0027ve got a big heart in a little body. I\u0027d wager my cobbler\u0027s stall that I\u0027m going to sit on in the clouds when your dream comes true--I\u0027d wager that to a brass thimble that if you had only one bit o\u0027 bread, and you was hungry as you could be, you\u0027d give it to baby, if she cried for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two or three bright tears glistened in Sally\u0027s eyes, which Seth accepted as confirmation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Take credit for that, Sally.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, Mr. Dumbrick,\" said Sally gratefully, satisfied with this reward of good words for good intentions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going to take credit, too, Sally. I\u0027m going to teach you and baby to read and write.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"O! Mr. Dumbrick!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s as much as a real father could do. Reading\u0027s a grand thing, Sally. We\u0027ve much to be thankful for. Be thankful, Sally.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am, Mr. Dumbrick, I am, oh, so much!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t like that mister, Sally.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No?\" questioned Sally, for ever on the alert to discover her guardian\u0027s likes or dislikes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s too much like company manners. Now that we\u0027re comfortably settled we ought to be more sociable. Call me Dad, or Daddy, or Daddy Dumbrick. Your tongue\u0027ll soon get used to it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Mr.--Dad-dy Dumbrick.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sally\u0027s tongue tripped so comically over the new terms that she laughed, and Seth grimly joined in the merriment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We soon get used to things, Sally. Once on a time we usedn\u0027t to live in houses.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In what, then, Daddy Dumbrick?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In tents and forests and fields and that like.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As the gipsies do,\" cried Sally. \"I\u0027ve seed \u0027em. Mother took me to a fair once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now we live in garrets and cellars, and sweet-smelling habitations.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sally looked dubious. Many of the houses round about Rosemary Lane were far from sweet-smelling, and she could not realise the advantage of the present over the past of which Seth was evidently boasting. To live in a tent in forest or field was a dream of Elysium to her, with flowers growing around her home and green grass waving. Too good for earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Once on a time,\" continued Seth, \"we couldn\u0027t read; now we can. Once on a time we weren\u0027t civilised; now we are. We\u0027ve much more to be thankful for than we know of. This is the age of enlightenment, Sally, and the best thing I can do is to give you your first lesson.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sally hastily put aside her work, and kneeling by baby\u0027s side stooped and kissed her. Seth, who had risen in search of a book, looked down upon the children.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you forget, Sally, what I said about you\u0027re going off in a trance. No, no, Sally!\" he cried, putting his hand to his side to restrain his merriment; \"not now. Don\u0027t you go fainting dead away now; we\u0027ve got something else to do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wasn\u0027t going to, Daddy,\" said Sally timorously, and with something like a blush on her thin, sallow face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bravo, Sally; there\u0027s some lessons you know without being able to read--to tell the truth when it\u0027s necessary, and to tell the other thing when it\u0027s necessary. You little sinner, you! You\u0027ve the gumption of twenty grown-up women in that little carcase of yours. Here\u0027s a book with large print. It belonged to my mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He brought forward a great heavy quarto with old broken clasps, and opened it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I shall read out loud the first few words and then you shall learn the letters one by one. Keep your eyes and your mind open and come closer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So saying, Seth, taking the forefinger of Sally\u0027s right hand as a marker, read slowly the words, \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49487.html","bookId":1173,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:53:38 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:53:38 AM"}
