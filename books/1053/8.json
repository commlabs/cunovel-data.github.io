Gradually, his presence of mind returned to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What made you fix upon me as the one likely to have the watch?\" he asked. \"Why didn\u0027t you select some other passenger?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The stout man hesitated. He could not say what was the truth, that Robert had been described to him by his confederate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was your guilty look,\" he answered, after a pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you think I look guilty?\" said our hero, with an amused smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I do,\" said the other defiantly. \"I have had a great deal to do with crooks in my time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt of it,\" chimed in a new voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both Robert and the man who accused him looked round. The voice proceeded from a tall, rough-looking man who sat behind Robert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The accuser looked a little uneasy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 60]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As I said, I know a crook when I see him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So do I,\" said the rough-looking man, who had the appearance of a Western miner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My friend,\" said the claimant of the watch severely, \"will you do me the favor to mind your own business?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s good advice. I hope you follow it yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you give me the watch, or are you prepared to be arrested?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Describe the watch,\" said Robert composedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have. It is a gold watch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So is this,\" said the miner, producing a heavy gold watch from his fob.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You needn\u0027t put in your oar,\" said the claimant, frowning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The boy is right. Describe the watch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have already said that it is a gold watch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So is this. Do you claim this watch as yours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. I suppose it is your watch. The watch in the boy\u0027s pocket is not his.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Correct, squire. But that doesn\u0027t prove it is yours.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is the man who handed it to me?\" asked Robert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 61]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t believe there is any such man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bring him here, and I will hand it to him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s where your head\u0027s level, boy,\" said the miner. \"If this man wants any proof that he asked you to keep it for him, he can call on me. I saw him do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt!\" sneered the accuser. \"I presume you are in league with the boy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The miner coolly lifted the window beside his seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you see that window,\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. What of it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you any particular desire to be thrown out?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" answered the other, in evident alarm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then don\u0027t you dare to insinuate that I am in league with anybody for crooked work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he spoke, he rose to his full height, showing a muscular figure, rather more than six feet in length. Robert\u0027s antagonist was about six inches shorter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No offense, mister,\" he said meekly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You seem to be coming to your senses. Now, is this watch yours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What watch?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The watch in the boy\u0027s pocket.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 62]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did the other man get hold of it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If he had it at all, he stole it from me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very good; we\u0027ll investigate this. My young friend, come with me into the smoking-car.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The claimant protested uneasily, but the miner insisted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He and Robert left the car and went into the one behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There about the middle of the car sat the man from whom Robert had received the watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give it back to him,\" said the miner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert walked up to his first acquaintance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want you to take back your watch,\" he said. \"This man says it belongs to him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tall, thin man looked at his confederate. He saw that their little plan of frightening Robert into giving them ten dollars had failed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you send him in to me?\" went on Robert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is some mistake. I sent him in for it, but he misunderstood me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked askance at the miner, who he saw was disposed to be a friend of Robert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look here,\" said the miner sternly, \"you are a precious pair of rascals. Your little game hasn\u0027t worked. I have seen such men as you before. I was on the vigilance committee in San[Pg 63] Francisco some years ago, and such fellows as you we strung up to the nearest lamp-post. Can you make it convenient to get off at the next station?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s where we intend to stop,\" said the tall man meekly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is fortunate. It will save you a good deal of trouble. Now, boy, come back into the other car. We have no further business with these gentlemen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Going back, they sat down in the same seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am very much obliged to you for getting me out of the scrape,\" said Robert gratefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t mention it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you really think they were——?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Crooks? Yes. They had all the signs. I\u0027ve rubbed against such fellows before now. These fellows are not smart. They don\u0027t understand the rudiments of the business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You spoke of San Francisco. Have you been there?\" asked Robert with interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I lived there and at the mines for five years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Were you lucky?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean, did I strike it rich? Well, I had middling luck. I didn\u0027t go there for nothing. How much do you think I had when I landed at Frisco?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 64]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A hundred dollars?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I had just three dollars and a half. I had one extra shirt, and that was about all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That wasn\u0027t a very large supply. Where did you go from?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was raised in Vermont. Worked on a farm for dad till I was twenty-two. Then with fifty dollars, which I had in the savings bank, I started for California. Well, I got there at last, but my funds were almost gone. I got a chance to do some rough work till I had enough to go to the mines. There I made something of a pile, enough to pay off the mortgage on the old farm, and have ten thousand dollars left. I\u0027ve just come from there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you ever expect to go back to the mines?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. I should not be satisfied now to remain at the East. Where are you going?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To the city.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To get a place?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, if I can.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you parents living?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have a mother,\" said Robert slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you want to get work to help support her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, she has plenty of money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 65]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then why do you leave home?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert looked at his companion. His plain, honest face impressed him favorably. He felt that he was a man in whom he could confide.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have a step-father,\" he said briefly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I understand. You and he don\u0027t hitch horses. Is that so?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell me all about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will. I should like to ask somebody\u0027s advice. I want to know whether I have done right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go ahead, my lad.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert told the story, and the miner listened attentively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know what I think of that step-father of yours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think he is about as mean a skunk as I ever heard mentioned. What made your mother marry him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know. She must have been infatuated.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose you had an easy time at home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I did.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And now you will have to work for a living?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but I don\u0027t mind that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 66]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see you\u0027re the right sort,\" said the miner approvingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They had reached the next station. In the next car there was a tumult and a noise as of men scuffling. The miner rose and opened the door of the car.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He and Robert saw the two men who had tried to swindle our hero in the hands of two angry men, who hustled them out of the car with such violence that they fell prostrate beside the track.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked the miner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"These men tried to relieve me of my watch. They won\u0027t try it again in a hurry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bruised by the fall, the two men picked themselves up and slunk away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re a precious pair of rascals,\" said the miner. \"If we had them at the mines, they would soon dangle from the branch of a tree.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52292.html","bookId":1053,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM"}
