It was much too risky for him to leave you behind,” Carrie explained. “And you could have told the police where he was taking us,” Sara added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I’m sure he lied about where we were going. He lied about everything else, didn’t he?” Sara asked. She suddenly looked weary, and her voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, he didn’t lie about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Sara and Carrie frowned at Anne. “How do you know?” Carrie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I saw the sign. It was a tarnished brass plaque in the center of the iron gate. The driver pushed the button on that remote control gadget, and I read the sign as the gate was swinging open. Land Between the Lakes. So he didn’t lie about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was very observant of you,” Sara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For all the good that does us,” Anne said. “We can’t tell anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie’s head snapped up. “Oh, my God, I did tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you say?” Sara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called my niece from the airport. I was in the ladies’ room, and I remembered I had my cell phone in the pocket of my blazer, so I called her. Her voice mail picked up and I left a message telling her where we were going to be spending the night. What a fool I am. I went on and on about the famous guests who had stayed here before. Monk—if that is his real name—must have done his research.” Tears flooded her eyes as she whispered, “That’s why he was telling those stupid stories about movie stars. He knew I’d be impressed. I’m such a shallow fool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He played all of us,” Sara said. “Did you tell your niece the name of the property?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Carrie answered. “I don’t know if she got the message because she might have already left for the airport. What if he was there waiting for her?” Her voice broke on a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara reached across the table and patted Carrie’s hand. “If he had been waiting for her, wouldn’t he have driven her here? Maybe that’s what they’re waiting for,” she added. “Maybe that’s why they haven’t . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t what?” Anne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Killed us,” Sara said bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you said they left us food in the pantry and in the freezer, so they obviously want to keep us alive a little while longer,” Anne argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara disagreed. “The food . . . that’s what’s so alarming. Doesn’t it seem more frightening to you that they didn’t empty the cabinets?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie hadn’t thought of it that way, but now she agreed with Sara. “I think that means they’re going to blow the house soon. They’re not going to let us sit in here until it’s all gone. They left the water on too,” she pointed out. “We have to get out of here.” She buried her face in her hands and whispered, “I’ve got to get to Avery. If that monster has her . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Concentrate on finding a way out, Carrie, so that you can help your niece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne straightened in her chair and nodded. “As long as you both agree I’m innocent, I’ll help and I won’t do anything crazy, like opening a door. I promise, but you have to say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie lifted her head. “Say what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne straightened in her chair. “That I’m innocent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was, of course, implying Sara and Carrie weren’t. It was infuriating, her holier-than-thou attitude, but Carrie caught Sara’s nod and decided she had to get along with Anne if she wanted her cooperation. “Yes, you are innocent,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Sara concurred, Anne turned to Carrie. “You should try to make amends with your sister, fix the wrong you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how Carrie hated the woman. She held her tongue as Anne preached on. “Family is the most important thing of all. I recently learned that truth. Being able to lean on someone . . . like my husband when times get difficult . . . that’s very important. I’m very fortunate,” she continued. “My husband adores me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was excited when she turned to Sara. “He’ll sound the alarm. My husband calls every single day. He’s never missed. I told him not to bother while I was at the spa because I’d be doing all those treatments, and it would be difficult for him to get hold of me, but he wouldn’t listen. He said he couldn’t go to sleep at night unless he talked to me. So don’t you see? If we can just wait it out, my husband will have the police tearing Colorado apart looking for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t wait,” Carrie objected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shook her head at her for losing her cool. “You sound like you have a wonderful marriage,” she told Anne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do. We’re blissfully happy.” There was a note of defiance. “And he will search for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’m sure he will,” Sara placated. “But we might not have time to wait for the police to find us. Colorado’s a big state.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne nodded. “Yes, you’re right. We have to help ourselves. All right,” she said as she untied the cord around her right arm. “What can I do? I don’t know that I can be much help because I’m just getting over a long bout of illness. I’ve lost weight, and I don’t have my strength back yet. I’m an excellent cook, though. I could fix us something to eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be wonderful,” Sara said. “Thank you, Anne.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie wasn’t as trusting. Maybe Anne had come to her senses. Then again, maybe she was simply playing them. The stakes were too high to trust her. Carrie decided that either she or Sara had to keep an eye on the woman at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is anyone hungry now?” Anne asked as she stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am,” Sara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne didn’t seize the opportunity to make a sarcastic remark about Sara’s weight this time. In fact, she apologized for what she had said earlier, and damn if she didn’t sound sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never should have called you a fat pig. I was overwrought, but that is a poor excuse for hurting your feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sara, why don’t you stay here and keep Anne company while I search the house again,” Carrie said. “I’ll start at the top and work my way down. I’ve got to be missing something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was actually beginning to feel a little optimistic as she ran up the stairs. She hurriedly dressed in her designer sweats and then methodically rechecked each opening. There was a tiny window high up in the corner of her bedroom. It took her a long time to move the bureau over to the wall and then climb up, but she still wasn’t tall enough. She ran downstairs to get one of the dining room chairs. She noticed Sara was standing on a chair in front of the double-pane living room windows. She had a lipstick and was printing the word “help” across the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie stopped her. “If Monk, or whatever the hell the bastard’s name is, has put a triggering device outside . . .” She didn’t have to finish her thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The house will blow when help arrives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a possibility,” Carrie said as she lifted the chair and started back up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll stop,” Sara said. She got off the chair and went to get a towel to wipe off the letters she’d just written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about trying to cut through the glass?” Carrie heard Anne ask as she continued on up the spiral staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie’s arms ached from the exertion of lifting the chair on top of the bureau. It took her three tries, and she was panting because she was so terribly out of shape. She fell trying to climb to the top, but fortunately, she landed on the bed. She propped the chair against the wall and tried again. When she was finally able to reach the window, she burst into tears. The son of a bitch had wired that tiny little egress too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t give up, no matter how hopeless their situation was. Maybe Anne’s suggestion would work. Maybe they could cut through the glass without disturbing the wires. Wiping the tears from her eyes, she gingerly scraped her diamond ring against the sliding glass door. Fifteen minutes later she stopped. All she had managed to do in that time was make a small scratch on the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie walked down a flight to the next level and proceeded to examine Anne’s room and then Sara’s. She spent hours trying one thing and then another before she finally gave up. She’d wasted the afternoon and part of the evening on the impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJILLY WALKED AROUND THE STONE BENCH NESTLED IN THE grotto facing the serenity pool. She paused to watch an instructor dressed in white tai chi clothing lead his students in an ancient exercise. The teacher was quite graceful, but his students were obviously novices, and their movements were stiff and awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued on to where Monk had parked the all-terrain Mercedes. Flowers were in full bloom wherever she looked. There were even large patches of flowers along the back parking lot. Utopia was enchanting, and perhaps when this business was concluded, she could come back here for a full week of pampering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone rang just as she slid behind the wheel of the new car. She had been waiting for Monk to call from his satellite phone, and she answered before the first ring ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, darling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk smiled. He loved the sound of her throaty voice and the way she whispered the endearment. “Has she arrived yet?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’ve just sent her on her way, and I’m leaving now. I’ll take the shortcut you found for me, and I’ll be there a good forty minutes ahead of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you enjoy talking to your daughter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it was lovely,” she gushed. “She’s afraid. Thank you, darling, for letting me do this. There is one little worry, however.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avery wasn’t alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asked sharply. “Who was with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man,” she answered. Adjusting her phone against her ear, she started the car and pulled out of the parking lot. “Her lover, no doubt,” she speculated. “I had to include him because he knows that Carrie is missing. He went into the manager’s office with Avery. Did I do the right thing? Did I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she needed reassurance. “Yes, of course you did the right thing. Did you happen to get his name? Do you know anything about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she answered. “I thought about asking the clerk or the manager, but then I decided to wait and talk to you first. Do you want me to go back and find out who he is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, don’t do that,” he said. “You’d only draw attention to yourself. You’re so beautiful, people will remember you . . . and you do look like Avery. I’ll find out who he is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, all right. Are you ready for both of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The plan’s changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The river store is open, and business, I’m afraid, is booming. It’s been busier than a 7-Eleven since early morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can that be?” she cried. “You checked. The owner was mauled by a bear and won’t get out of the hospital for at least another week. You checked,” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was becoming upset. He hurriedly tried to quiet her fears. “It’s going to be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t let it go. “But how can the store be open?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The owner’s cousin from Arkansas opened the store this morning. The owner must have called him. It doesn’t matter,” he stressed. “We’re simply going to plan B. You remember, I told you I always have a contingency plan in mind whenever I take on a new assignment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember,” she said, relieved. “You’re so clever, darling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe least little praise made him want to please her all the more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” she said urgently. “The package with Carrie’s red scarf. Is it still there on the counter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but that doesn’t matter now,” he said. He had already thought the matter through. The original plan had been to lure Avery into the store by placing a large manila envelope with her name on it on the counter by the window so she would see it when she looked inside. She would be desperate and break in. Monk would be waiting for her, and after he had killed her, he would bury her in the forest about a hundred yards behind the store. He’d already gone to the trouble of digging her grave. The hole was deep enough to accommodate her lover as well, he supposed, but now that the store was open and there was a steady stream of customers coming and going, Monk knew he couldn’t kill them there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have Carrie’s wallet with you?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it’s in my purse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” he praised. “We’ll use it, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I get to help? You promised me,” she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he deny her? It would have been so much easier if she’d agreed to stay at the spa and let him do his job. Jilly complicated his life, made him scramble to get everything done the way she wanted it done, but she was such a joy to be with, he didn’t mind. He had tried to talk her into blowing up the house before they left it last night, but she wouldn’t hear of it. She wanted her sister to wake up and know who was killing her and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk didn’t like leaving the women, but he couldn’t be in two places at once, and Avery’s unexpected arrival had thrown him a curve. He hadn’t let Jilly know how unsettling and worrisome those last-minute changes were, but now that he’d worked it all out in his mind, he was feeling in control again. He wished he had more time to go over the plan, but that wasn’t possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Darling, did you hear me? I get to help, don’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed his concerns aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course you can help. How would you like to talk to Avery again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “Oh, I’d love to,” she said. “I’m hurrying to you. I’m already turning onto that little road you found. I won’t be long. When I get there, you have to tell me exactly what you want me to say to her. I don’t want to mess up again like I did in Virginia when I took that old woman’s car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush now. Don’t fret about that. It’s water under the bridge. Besides, you’re a rookie,” he said with a chuckle. “You were bound to make a few mistakes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I only wanted to please you, and I thought that, if I could immobilize her, I would make your job so much easier for you. You could have broken into her apartment and killed her there. I thought you could make it look like a robbery.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killjoy-buchanan-renard-3/page-21.html","bookId":1833,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:17 PM"}
