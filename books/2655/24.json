Sister Mala accompanied me to my room, exclaiming sarcastically the whole way how much she enjoyed my company and hoped I was pleased with her service. \"I\u0027ll have the servants send up hot water for you, Duchess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at her but did not mention what a poor chaperone she made. I had no idea if she even would have been able to travel in the Graylands with me and the lich tsar. \"I don\u0027t suppose I have fresh clothes here, do I?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were unable to bring the trunks with us. However, I will find something suitable for you,\" Sister Mala said. \"The crown prince will expect you downstairs in the dining room properly dressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight,\" I begged. \"I want nothing more than a bath and a good night\u0027s rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"If the crown prince will allow it\" was all she would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the crown prince was merciful. By the time I\u0027d finished scrubbing several layers of desert sand off my skin in the bathtub, Sister Mala had returned with a beautiful blue gown, comparable to the latest Paris fashions, with matching blue kid slippers and soft kid gloves. She also brought a gossamer nightgown and robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crown prince hopes you have a pleasant night\u0027s rest and requests your presence in the morning at breakfast. He begs that you at least take some tea and bread before retiring tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Tell him he has my gratitude. I will have just a little tea, if you would be so kind as to send for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were cold as she nodded. \"Of course, Duchess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she left, I slipped into the nightgown and robe before she could return. The ensemble was close to indecent. Maman would be horrified to see me wearing such a gown. A lump formed in my throat as I thought of her and Papa. They had probably given up looking for me, Petya as well. Maman had either taken to her bed with hysterics or set off for Biarritz to escape the scandal of a runaway daughter. I only hoped the tsar\u0027s men did not harass my family thinking they knew where I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Mala returned with a sharp knock. She entered, followed by a servant with a tea tray. \"Put it down over there,\" she said. As soon as the servant had left, Sister Mala sat in one of the chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you joining me for tea?\" I asked, clutching my robe. I wished I had a long black habit, as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are good friends, you and I,\" she said, her words startling me. \"We have been traveling companions for a while now. The crown prince would not want any scandal to arise that could taint your betrothal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood her perfectly. She would lie to anyone who asked whether I\u0027d been out of her sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He and I are not betrothed. We have not been betrothed for over a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Mala shook her head as she poured out two cups of hot tea. \"How silly of you not to remember, Duchess. You and the crown prince are to be married in St. Petersburg next month. It has been a long-standing secret engagement. But as soon as Konstantin becomes the tsar, he will want to be married as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed me one of the teacups and smiled. \"He is certain you will be just as anxious as he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I be?\" I hesitated before drinking the tea. I did not trust Sister Mala one bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you not excited about becoming tsarina? It\u0027s a fairy tale come true!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not my fairy tale. And I don\u0027t believe he will become tsar. The Romanovs will stop him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Romanovs and their foolish bogatyr?\" Sister Mala laughed. \"The Romanovs are weak, especially the current tsar. He can do nothing without his precious necromancer. And now his necromancer has changed her loyalty to the true tsar. Konstantin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something familiar in the girl\u0027s laugh. And a familiar faint fae sparkle in her eyes. I could have sworn I\u0027d known her before the trip to Egypt. \"Which court do you belong to, Sister Mala?\" I asked. \"Dark Court or Light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flashed in anger, and I saw my guess had not been wrong. \"There are those of fae blood who do not belong to either court, Duchess.\" She drew herself up, sitting regally in her chair as if she were a queen. \"There are wild fae as well, and we are more dangerous than any court creature you\u0027ll ever meet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truly?\" I murmured. \"Then why do you follow the crown prince?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up. \"I follow the true tsar, Konstantin Pavlovich! His lady, Princess Cantacuzene, saved my mother\u0027s life.\" As she crossed the room in graceful strides, she seemed almost to float. \"My mother was a wild fae, hunted by one of the Dark Court princes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princes?\" The Grand Duchess Miechen had several boys, but none of them were older than me. To have been hunting Mala\u0027s mother...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not the Grand Duchess Miechen\u0027s court at the time,\" she said, as if reading my mind. \"Almost twenty years ago, the Dark Court was ruled by a French faerie. My mother was a Polish noblewoman who attended Princess Cantacuzene. She was attacked by one of the French princes and left to fend for herself and her unborn child. Princess Cantacuzene took me at my mother\u0027s pleading and brought me to a Polish family of dancers in St. Petersburg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, finally recognizing the gray eyes. \"You are Mathilde Kschessinskaya, the ballerina Nicholas has been obsessed with!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as she pulled her head covering off. Black curls fell down around her shoulders. \"He will always love me, Duchess. And I will be there to comfort him, of course, when his father loses the throne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is the true heir! And you don\u0027t love him at all, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is nothing but a handsome young fool. Konstantin Pavlovich is the true tsar. It is at his command that I keep the young tsarevitch occupied. Along with many other grand dukes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danilo told you to flirt with Nicholas?\" I was astonished. It seemed to me Danilo would have wanted George\u0027s attention diverted. Perhaps it was truly Konstantin\u0027s logic dictating the crown prince\u0027s behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is no longer your precious Danilo,\" Mala snapped. Then her face melted back into the icy smile. \"But if it makes you happy to pretend, Duchess, what can it hurt? It is still the crown prince\u0027s lips that will be kissing you and the crown prince\u0027s arms that will hold you in the night, when you become Konstantin\u0027s bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and walked to my bed, protected from insects and other nasty creatures by a thin gauze canopy. I pushed the curtains aside and turned to Mala. \"I think I would like to retire now, if you do not mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and rang for the servant to pick up the tea tray. \"Sweet dreams, Duchess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed the servant out, leaving me to sink down on my bed in misery. My only comfort was knowing that she was here in Egypt and not mesmerizing the tsarevitch. I curled up under my covers, hoping at least that Princess Alix and Nicholas were happy now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-24.html","bookId":2655,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM"}
