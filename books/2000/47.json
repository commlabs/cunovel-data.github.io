It’s getting pretty serious from what Beth says, and she told me the other day that Toni and her have been discussing moving in together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so happy for her. Beth is amazing, and we’ve grown close. It’s great to have a female friend here, especially one as fun and cool as Beth is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes me out shopping and to the beauty salon. All things friends are supposed to do, but I was never allowed. It’s novel for me, even now. I don’t think I’ll ever take being able to do these things for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll never take my freedom for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd being in the good place that I am now, settled into my new life … I think that was why Jordan felt I was ready to have my mother’s locket. He was confident it wouldn’t push me back a step. He was feeling my peace. And he was right. I can’t say it was easy to see the locket which Jim had kept of Annabelle’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had hidden inside of it, a tiny picture of baby me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though it pained me to see, it also gave me a sense of peace in some way to know that in her own way she had always been thinking of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I ever do what she did? No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s easier to judge when you’re on the receiving end of the hurt. And I know too well what it’s like to be with a controlling, abusive man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what it was like to live with Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sold my apartment in Boston and all the furniture in it. I never went back. Jordan handled it all for me. And I moved into the hotel with Jordan and Jim, and of course Dozer. Too soon, probably, but I spent a long time living unhappily. Jordan is my happy, so I was grabbing it with both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI invested some of Oliver’s money into the hotel. Both Jim and Jordan protested – Jordan the loudest. He was having none of it at first, but it was also my mother’s hotel, and now my home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want it to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo after a few well timed seductions, I got my own way. Jordan finds it hard to say no to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel is doing amazingly well. Jordan really got the business moving. The website and links he built have helped immensely. Also, he set up a business deal with Wade, and they tied the jeeps tours into the hotel. People can stay at the hotel, and the tours go from here. Using some of the money I put in, Jordan had a garage built to store the jeeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s really helped things. I’m so proud of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m proud of me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Harvard, but I haven’t left behind medicine completely. I’m just moving in a different direction. I’ve enrolled in Veterinary school to start this term. I’m hoping Dozer will let me practice my examining and bandaging skills on him. I’m sure he will; he’s pretty soft on me as I am him, much to Jordan’s annoyance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut school is a little way off starting as it’s summer break, and today is a year to the day since Jordan and I first met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were supposed to be going out to dinner, but that’s off the menu now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a gift for him that I can’t wait any longer to give to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to get out of bed, but Jordan catches my hand. “Where you going, babe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought as we weren’t going to dinner now … you might want your gift?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes light up. “Well if you’re giving me mine, then I guess it’s only fair you get yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart does a somersault in my chest. He got me a gift! Not that I thought he wouldn’t. I’ve just never received a gift in this context before – not one where there’s no pain before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing to my closet, I get out the envelope containing Jordan’s gift. I put a lot of thought and effort into his gift. I think he’ll like it … I think … I’m not sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, I’m so nervous! I’ve never given anyone a gift like this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet him back on the bed. We sit facing each other. I keep the envelope containing Jordan’s present behind my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s going first?” he asks, looking excited, like a little kid on his birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m excited too. Trembling with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could open together. Or you first. Or me,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raises his eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? I’m just excited!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not together,” he says. “’Cause I want to see the look on your face when you open mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. You go first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nervous, trembling hand brings the envelope around to give to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes meet mine, a puzzled look in them. Then he takes it from me, and tears the envelope open. Hand in, he pulls the papers out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his eyes reading over it, then widening as he takes the details in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes lift to mine. Awe and love in them. It squeezes my heart. “Did you really do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “Not on my own though, the agent helped me … is it too much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes go down to the papers, then lift back to mine. Now they’re glistening, and I can feel my own welling up. “No … it’s just … fuckin’ amazing, babe … I can’t believe you did this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tug on my lip. “I was thinking of what to get you, and I remembered how you sounded that day when you said you’d never go traveling again. The sadness in your voice. I didn’t want that to be the case. I know how much you love traveling … seeing the world, so I thought I’d finish off the trip you started with your friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gift I bought Jordan was the rest of the trip he never got to finish when Anna got sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bought a three week vacation, leaving in a week, taking us to India, then Nepal, onto Hong Kong, then Shanghai, and ending in Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a gift for me too as I’ve never travelled before. And who better to break that virginity with than Jordan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face breaks into a grin. “Looks like we’re on the same page with our gifts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls out an envelope, similar to mine from behind his back. “Open it.” He smiles, handing it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tear the envelope open, and pull out the contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A trip to Paris at Christmas!” I yell, then cover my mouth with my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles. “I knew you’d never left the country before, and I’ve never been to Europe, so I thought we could go over for Christmas. Looks like we’re gonna accrue some serious air miles this year.” He grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI launch myself at him, kissing him deeply. He takes us down to the bed, rolling me underneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand slides down my thigh, cupping my butt, covering my scars, holding me. “Love you, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came here to Colorado, looking for my mother, trying so hard to escape my past. Trying to find a purpose, a reason to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might not have found my mother in the way I’d first hoped, but instead I found so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found something I’ve never before had—never dreamed I would have … a real family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan, Jim, Beth and Dozer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut best of all … I got love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot love under fear or condition. Not love that comes with a price. I got real, honest to god love in all its purest forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamily love. Friend love. Unconditional love. And the best love of all…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me the one thing he’s never given to anyone before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me his heart, and his trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in return, I gave him the same right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-47.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
