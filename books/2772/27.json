The last one was a par three, and how you managed to get an eight on it is embarrassing. I think I need to give you private lessons, so next time we can kick a little frolf ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Private lessons sound good,\" she says, then kisses the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys are dorks,\" Kendra says when we finally arrive at the next hole. I kneel so Maggie can slide off my back without too much stress on her leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call my best friend a dork, Kendra,\" Brian says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra puts her hand on her hip and flips her hair back. Oh, no. That\u0027s not a good sign. \"Don\u0027t defend him. And he\u0027s not just your friend, Brian.

It\u0027s a flask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, what\u0027re you doing?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. This is not happening. Not in front of Lenny and Julio and my sister. And not in front of Maggie, who hates Kendra drama more than anything. I want her to forget my past, not be reminded of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra tosses one of the discs, aiming directly at Brian\u0027s nuts. Brian barely dodges the disc, takes another swig of whatever he\u0027s got in the flask, and looks his fiance right in the eye. \"Let\u0027s have a contest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny\u0027s eyes light up. The dude loves challenges more than anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulio leans into me and says so nobody else can hear, \"These are your friends? They\u0027re all fuckin\u0027 lunatics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is coming from a guy who\u0027s been in jail for robbery and money laundering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you what,\" Brian says, getting really pissed at Kendra now. I can tell because his face is getting all red and splotchy. That only happens right after he works out or when he\u0027s really pissed. \"If I win the next hole, the wedding\u0027s back on. If you win, you\u0027re free to call it off and be with Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn, not happening. \"Brian, don\u0027t be an idiot,\" I tell him, but he\u0027s not listening. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s high on top of being drunk. He\u0027s definitely not himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" Kendra says, ignoring me. \"But it\u0027s not a fair matchup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. You pick who throws for me, and I pick who throws for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie attempts to hide behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pick Maggie. She\u0027ll throw for you,\" Kendra says through clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I pick Leah,\" Brian says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I opt out?\" Maggie asks them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red-faced Brian and a raging Kendra both say \"no\" at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys, just kiss and make up already,\" I tell them. \"You\u0027re pregnant, Kendra.

She wants to win me, fair and square. Doesn\u0027t she realize she already has me, and doesn\u0027t have to fight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch in awe as my girl takes a disc in her hand and goes to the tee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie...\" I say. \"Umm ... You grabbed a putter. That won\u0027t go too far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out another disc for her, which she takes with a murmured thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie takes a deep breath, then lets it rip with an impressive grunt.

Julio tries to give her some pointers, but I\u0027m not sure my twin sis wants Kendra to win. My sister whips the disc, but it also veers and lands in the bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man, this is torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, it\u0027s neck and neck. My sister holds her putter while Maggie holds hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Maggie says before Leah aims for the metal basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah stills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie holds her disc at her side. \"I can\u0027t do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither,\" Leah adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie limps up to Kendra. \"I don\u0027t play games with people\u0027s lives like you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Atta girl!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie drops the disc at Kendra\u0027s feet. \"If you let him go and he doesn\u0027t come back to you, he wasn\u0027t yours to begin with. It\u0027s a lesson I learned in first grade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan, my girl is one tough chick when she wants to be. I wonder if it has something to do with those big, comfy granny panties she\u0027s got on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie limps away, my sister at her side. It reminds me of when we were kids and they were inseparable. I like that they\u0027re figuring out how to be friends again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch until Maggie and Leah are out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m out of here,\" Kendra says, storming off to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" Brian says, turning to storm off to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step in front of him. \"I can\u0027t let you do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re drunk.

I never liked Kendra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop and turn to her. \"What would you think about Caleb and me as a couple?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t answer. Her non-answer is my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving for Spain in less than two weeks, so you won\u0027t have to see us together for much longer.\" My words come out quick and I know she can tell I\u0027m upset. \"Leah, something\u0027s gotta give.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI limp away from her now, but I hear Caleb calling after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s everyone else?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lenny ended up driving Brian home-he was pretty wasted-and Julio and Trish went with them,\" Caleb says. \"Listen Maggie. About the game ... I\u0027m sorry.\" He moves in front of me. \"I shouldn\u0027t have forced that situation on you. I just thought we could be a normal couple and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll never be a normal couple, Caleb. We have so much baggage it\u0027s ridiculous.\" I hold a hand up when I see he\u0027s about to protest. \"I\u0027m living in reality. Reality is that Kendra still wants you in her life and your sister still wants me out of your life-it\u0027s easier on her that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust thinking about Kendra and Leah is overwhelming right now. \"I need to get away from here,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take out the keys to my car. \"Where I always go to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s any consolation,\" he says, \"I don\u0027t give a shit what anyone else thinks about us being together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I wish I didn\u0027t care, but I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get to my car, I immediately head over to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house. Lou isn\u0027t there, and neither is the For Sale sign. A sinking feeling forms the pit of my stomach when I think about someone else living in this house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I finger the white-painted wood of the gazebo, I think about what I said to Caleb. I know he\u0027s still struggling being at home where he doesn\u0027t feel like he belongs. I saw where he\u0027s been sleeping-on the couch in his living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny can\u0027t stay in the Beckers\u0027 house forever. I don\u0027t know why he doesn\u0027t have a home or family to go back to after our Re-START trip, but he\u0027s obviously sleeping at the Beckers\u0027 because he has nowhere else to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Julio was practically begging for a place to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I don\u0027t want to, I need to brace myself for the inevitable. Caleb is in my life temporarily. When I leave for Spain, we\u0027ll be going our separate ways. Should I make the most out of what we have now? Reality is, Caleb will soon be out of my life for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewo days after the frolf game, I\u0027m standing in front of my sister\u0027s bedroom door. Lenny and Julio went out, and my dad is at work. It\u0027s the perfect time to have it out with Leah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knock on the door and wait. She cracks it, but doesn\u0027t let me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens her door wide and sits on the edge of her bed. Her room used to have posters of guys in boy bands, but now she\u0027s got pictures of skulls and crossbones and posters that remind me of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s too fucked up for words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to come clean to Mom and Dad.\" There, I said it. \"I\u0027m done taking the fall. It wasn\u0027t just telling the cops I was the one driving. It wasn\u0027t just pleading guilty and being locked up in jail for almost a year. Our lie is like a fucking cancer that\u0027s spread to every single area of our lives.\" I point to the posters on her wall. \"You do realize this is your cry for help. It\u0027s sick shit, Leah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more I look at those skull pictures staring at me with their empty-holed eyes, the more I want to rebel against it. I\u0027m not dead. I don\u0027t want to be dead. I don\u0027t want my sister to be dead. And I sure as hell don\u0027t want to be haunted by the past anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised,\" she says in an eerily calm voice. \"When I told you about the accident, you said youd take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was drunk, Leah. I hardly knew what I was doing, and by the time I realized I shouldn\u0027t have lied to the police, it was too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I wasn\u0027t?\" I snap. But maybe she didn\u0027t know how I was feeling, because I masked every emotion I had after I got arrested. I take a deep breath and try again. \"It\u0027s time to tell Mom and Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up and see a picture of a skeleton with its teeth sunk into a heart and I can\u0027t take it anymore ... I rake my fingers across the wall and rip them all down. \"I\u0027m done with you looking like death warmed over. I hate what you did to Maggie. I hate it, and I hate you for making me promise to take our secret to the grave and then paying me back by being a fucking recluse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, lay off her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to see Julio standing in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay out of this, Julio,\" I growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of listening to me, Julio walks into the room and stands next to my sister. \"I said lay off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he kidding me? \"This doesn\u0027t have anything to do with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does,\" Leah murmurs.
