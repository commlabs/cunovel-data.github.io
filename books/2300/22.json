Things were already moving too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should go,\" she said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a minute.\" He backed her up against the side of the car and kissed her again, his body leaning into hers. They had made love only a short time ago and he was already wanting her again. He\u0027d become addicted to her, he thought, hopelessly, helplessly addicted to the sound of her voice, the warmth of her smile, the touch of her hand. Damn! He had it bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince kissed her again, and then again. He would have kissed her one more time if he hadn\u0027t suddenly become aware of being watched. Lifting his head, he scanned the darkness, then swore softly. It was only Di Giorgio, discreetly watching them from the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better go,\" Vince said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought... what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Di Giorgio\u0027s keeping an eye on us. Kind of ruins the moment, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara blew out a sigh. \"I thought he\u0027d stop following me when I moved out of the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m kind of glad he\u0027s there,\" Vince said, opening her car door for her. \"Gives me one less thing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you worry about me?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet.\" Bending down, he kissed her cheek. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Vince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Night, darlin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her pull out of the parking lot, watched Di Giorgio pull out behind her. Out of habit, he glanced at the sky, judging the time. There were still hours until dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to get into his car and drive home when he decided to take a walk instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets were dark and quiet at this time of night. Walking with preternatural speed, he soon reached the outskirts of the city. He continued on, enjoying the solitude and the beauty of the moonlit countryside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to turn back when the scent of blood filled his nostrils. Unable to resist, he followed the scent to what looked like an abandoned brick building. The windows were boarded up on the inside and barred on the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince frowned. The scent of blood was strong here and seemed to be coming from inside. He took a deep breath, only then realizing that the blood was animal, not human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunting softly, he walked around the perimeter. Save for the smell of blood, there was no sign that anyone had been there recently, not that it mattered to him one way or the other. Still, it was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the library parking lot, he got into his car and drove to The Nocturne. He felt Mara\u0027s presence as soon as he crossed the threshold. Amazingly, no one else seemed aware of the preternatural power that surrounded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice whispered inside his mind. Come, she said, join me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a command this time, but an invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found her sitting at a small table in the rear, a Bloody Mariah in one hand. A second drink sat, untouched, on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as he approached, then indicated he should take the chair across from her. \"That drink is for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince arched one brow. \"How did you know I\u0027d be here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled a mysterious smile. \"Did you think coming here was your own idea?\" Her voice was low, almost hypnotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it wasn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I was feeling lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you planted the thought of coming here in my mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, not the least bit guilty for tampering with his thoughts. \"The nights can sometimes be long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too long,\" he agreed. \"And it must be worse for you. Tell me, what\u0027s it like to exist for so many years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you ever tire of it? Ever grow bored with your existence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now and then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you handle it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are ways to refresh yourself. The best way is to rest in the earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, like burrow into the ground and sleep there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the bugs and the worms? Don\u0027t they...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will not come near you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of burying himself in the earth should have been repulsive; instead, he found it strangely appealing. He glanced at the glass in his hand. He should have found drinking blood repulsive, too, but he didn\u0027t. Funny, how one\u0027s perspective changed when one became a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince was about to remark on it to Mara when he saw Anton saunter into the club as if he owned the place. Vince grinned inwardly. Talk about repulsive. He didn\u0027t know what it was, but there was something about the man that made his skin crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evil,\" Mara said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man is evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince followed Mara\u0027s gaze and saw that she was staring at Anton Bouchard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton nodded at several women as he made his way to the bar. He hadn\u0027t seen Cara DeLongpre lately, but courting her was no longer necessary. His mother had other plans for DeLongpre\u0027s daughter now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was halfway across the room when he saw Vince Cordova sitting at a small table with a remarkably beautiful woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton snorted softly. Looked like Miss Cara Aideen DeLongpre had better find herself a new squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton smiled at the pretty redhead waiting for him at the bar. He hadn\u0027t wasted any time in Finding someone to take Cara\u0027s place. Her name was Stephanie and he had met her at The Nocturne last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a looker, she was, with curly red hair, dusky skin, and dark brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as he sat down beside her. Unlike Cara, Steph wasn\u0027t interested in anything but having a good time. They\u0027d had a hell of a good time last night, he thought as he kissed her cheek, and unless he missed his guess, they would be having another good time tonight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-22.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
