As bizarre as this conversation must be for him, Gideon was taking it seriously. \"Call it one of my quirks, and I\u0027m not saying that lightly. It pisses me off to feel used for sex. I feel devalued.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you look at it as you using me for sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with you.\" He was too forceful, too demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sizzling, predatory glimmer sparked in his eyes as I bared my weakness for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" I went on quickly, \"that\u0027s semantics. I need an equal exchange in my sexual relationships. Or to have the upper hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay? You said that really quickly considering I\u0027m telling you I need to combine two things you work so hard to avoid putting together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not comfortable with it and I don\u0027t claim to understand, but I\u0027m hearing you - it\u0027s an issue. Tell me how to get around it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath left me in a rush. I hadn\u0027t expected that. He was a man who wanted no complications with his sex and I was a woman who found sex complicated, but he wasn\u0027t giving up. Yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to be friendly, Gideon. Not best buds or confidants, but two people who know more about each other than their anatomy. To me, that means we have to spend time together when we\u0027re not actively f**king. And I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll have to spend time not actively f**king in places where we\u0027re forced to restrain ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that what we\u0027re doing now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And see, that\u0027s what I mean. I wasn\u0027t giving you credit for that. You should\u0027ve done it in a less creepy manner\" - I covered his lips with my fingers when he tried to cut me off - \"but I admit you did try to set up a time to talk and I wasn\u0027t helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nipped my fingers with his teeth, making me yelp and yank my hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. What was that for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted my abused hand to his mouth and kissed the hurt, his tongue darting out to soothe. And incite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn self-defense, I tugged my hand back to my lap. I still wasn\u0027t completely confident that we\u0027d worked things out. \"Just so you know there are no exaggerated expectations - when you and I spend time together not actively f**king, I won\u0027t think it\u0027s a date. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That covers it.\" Gideon smiled and my decision to be with him solidified for me. His smile was like lightning in the darkness, blinding and beautiful and mysterious, and I wanted him so badly it was physically painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands slid down to cup the backs of my thighs. Squeezing gently, he tugged me just a little bit closer. The hem of my short black halter dress slipped almost indecently high and his gaze was riveted to the flesh he\u0027d exposed. His tongue wet his lips in an action so carnal and suggestive I could almost feel the caress on my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuffy began begging for mercy, her voice drifting up from the dance floor below. An unwelcome ache developed in my chest and I rubbed at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d already had enough, but I heard myself saying, \"I need another drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a vicious hangover on Saturday morning and figured it was no less than I deserved. As much as I\u0027d resented Gideon\u0027s insistence on negotiating sex with as much passion as he would a merger, in the end I\u0027d negotiated in kind. Because I wanted him enough to take a calculated risk and break my own rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took comfort in knowing he was breaking some of his own, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long, hot shower, I made my way into the living room and found Cary on the couch with his netbook, looking fresh and alert. Smelling coffee in the kitchen, I headed there and filled the biggest mug I could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, sunshine,\" Cary called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my much-needed dose of caffeine wrapped between both palms, I joined him on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at a box on the end table. \"That came for you while you were in the shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my mug on the coffee table and picked up the box. It was wrapped with brown paper and twine, and had my name handwritten diagonally across the top with a decorative calligraphic flourish. Inside was an amber glass bottle with Hangover Cure painted on it in a white old-fashioned font and a note tied with raffia to the bottle\u0027s neck that said, \"Drink me.\" Gideon\u0027s business card was nestled in the cushioning tissue paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I studied the gift, I found it very apt. Since meeting Gideon I\u0027d felt like I\u0027d fallen down the rabbit hole into a fascinating and seductive world where few of the known rules applied. I was in uncharted territory that was both exciting and scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Cary, who eyed the bottle dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheers.\" I pried the cork out and drank the contents without thinking twice about it. It tasted like sickly sweet cough syrup. My stomach quivered in distaste for a moment, and then heated. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and shoved the cork back into the empty bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Cary asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the burn, it\u0027s hair of the dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nose wrinkled. \"Effective but unpleasant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was working. I already felt a little steadier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary picked up the box and dug out Gideon\u0027s card. He flipped it over; then held it out to me. On the back Gideon had written, \"Call me\" in bold slashing penmanship and jotted down a number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the card, curling my hand around it. His gift was proof that he was thinking about me. His tenacity and focus was seductive. And flattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no denying I was in trouble where Gideon was concerned. I craved the way I felt when he touched me, and I loved the way he responded when I touched him back. When I tried to think of what I wouldn\u0027t agree to do to have his hands on me again, I couldn\u0027t come up with much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cary tried to hand me the phone, I shook my head. \"Not yet. I need a clear head when dealing with him and I\u0027m still fuzzy.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-20.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
