Nothing, nada. Remember that. I... know... nothing. Never assume I know anything. Nada. Nothing. I know nothing, not a thing.

Let\u0027s move on.\" I wave my arm, gesturing at something invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the entire group follows me downstairs toward the third floor, the chef-Bongo from Venezuela via Vunderbahr, Moonclub, Paddy-O and MasaMasa-lights a cigarette and lowers his sunglasses while trying to keep up with me. \"Victor, we must talk.\" He coughs, waves smoke away. \"Please, my feet are killing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group stops. \"Uno momento, Bongo,\" I say, noticing the worried glances he\u0027s throwing Kenny Kenny, who\u0027s connected in some weird way to Glorious Foods and has yet to be informed he has nothing to do with catering tomorrow night\u0027s dinner. Peyton, JD, Bongo, Kenny Kenny, camcorder guy and Details girl wait for me to do something, and since I\u0027m at a loss I peer over the third-floor railing. \"Come on, guys. Shit, I mean I\u0027ve got three more floors and five more bars to check. Please, give me some space. This is all very hard. Those specks almost made me literally sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, no one would deny the existence of the specks,\" Peyton says carefully. \"But you have to place the specks within a, um, certain, well, context.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one of the monitors lining the walls on the third floor, MTV, a commercial, Helena Christensen, \"Rock the Vote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beau!\" I yell up. \"Beau?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeau leans over the top railing. \"Chloe says she\u0027ll be at Metro CC at eleven-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Beau-Ingrid Chavez? Has Ingrid Chavez RSVP\u0027d?\" I yell up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m checking-wait, for the dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and I\u0027m gritting my teeth, Beau. Check the Cs for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god I have got to speak to you, Victor,\" Bongo says in an accent so thick I\u0027m unsure of its origin, grabbing my arm. \"You must let me have my time with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bongo, why don\u0027t you just get get the the hell out of here,\" Kenny Kenny says, his face twisted. \"Here, Victor, try a crouton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatch one out of his hands. \"Mmm, rosemary.

Yes or No is the answer. What else could these people possibly have to say to me? It\u0027s not a difficult question: Are you coming to the dinner and the club opening or are you not?
