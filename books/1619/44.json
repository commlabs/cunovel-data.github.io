His lips were a line of triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 he announced, \u0027Dracula is dead. His head will be sent here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard remembered this had happened before. When Vlad Tepes was killed, his head was supposedly cut off and sent to the Sultan. Yet he had survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvents moved too swiftly for Croft\u0027s news to have much impact. Haig and Pershing were in dispute, competing for the honour of jamming breaches with their own dead. The telephone connected to the Prime Minister hung abandoned, twittering like a pathetic bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Mireau gone, the French were rallying sensibly. American troops arrayed themselves against the German advance: raw recruits against combat-hardened veterans, or fresh spirited men against battle-weary remainders. And the British were dug in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shell burst on the roof of HQ. A patch of plaster fell from the ceiling, dusting Croft and Churchill like pantomime ghosts. Only their livery lips and fiery eyes were red in white faces. Subalterns with buckets were sent off to douse the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It is evident the Diogenes Club should have ceded responsibility for the secret war earlier,\u0027 gloated the phantom Croft. \u0027Great losses might have been prevented.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe German advance came like a wave, spreading and breaking as it came up against the bulwarks of well-prepared positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChurchill did mental calculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cannot keep this up,\u0027 he said. \u0027With the Attila down, they will lose perspective. Confusion must set in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComte Hubert de Sinestre, a sardonic general, reported a sighting of Dracula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft paid attention. The Attila?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 said de Sinestre. \u0027Dracula leads his cavalry in full armour, mounted on a black horse, laying about him with a silver sword. Here, on the left flank. Where the gallant Mireau made his stand.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer indicated a German charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft was perturbed. \u0027We have definite word the Graf was in his airship. He was killed by ground troops.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe French vampire shrugged. \u0027English intelligence is notoriously suspect. I have the word of Colonel Dax, a most reliable officer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He was in the air. It is his character.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Graf proves remarkably mobile,\u0027 said Churchill. \u0027I\u0027ve been handed a despatch from Captain George Sherston of the Royal Flintshire Fusiliers which tells me Dragulya has personally led a bayonet charge on the right flank and been peppered with silver bullets. Another cause for celebration, Mr Croft?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft crushed the Attila oval in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We have a plague of doppelg?ngers,\u0027 Beauregard offered. \u0027Next the Graf will be spotted strolling down Piccadilly with a straw hat on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A mediaeval trick,\u0027 Churchill said, making a chubby fist. \u0027Impersonators to rally the troops, to draw fire.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The real Dracula was in his Zeppelin. I have affirmed it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft was green under his grey. His hands reached out involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cavalry Dracula is down,\u0027 said de Sinestre. \u0027Cut in two y a machine-gun. His charge is broken. Mireau is avenged.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will not do,\u0027 said Churchill. \u0027We must kill all of him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He is dead. Truly dead,\u0027 insisted Croft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027ll be somewhere safe,\u0027 concluded Beauregard. \u0027In Berlin, probably. This has all been a distraction.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 said Croft, firmly. His fingers closed on Beauregard\u0027s throat. \u0027I am right and you are wrong.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face, rotten under the tight skin, came close, ghastly green powdered with plaster dust. Beauregard gripped the vampire\u0027s wrists, trying to break the choke-hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficers tried to free him from Croft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I say,\u0027 snapped Haig, \u0027stop that, you two. I\u0027ll have no fighting in here. There\u0027s a war on, you know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft pushed him away, letting go. Beauregard coughed, breathing again, pulling his collar away from his bruised throat. The grey man calmed, deflated. Beauregard assumed the vampire\u0027s career was about to suffer a reversal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaig and Pershing came to an agreement and began piling American and British blocks on the road to Amiens. Black blocks, reinforced by cross-marked paper scraps, edged nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBombardment was constant and close. Blocks jumped on the table with each impact. Telephone lines were cut and re-established.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked at the table. The blocks were hopelessly mixed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConceiving of the losses, Beauregard\u0027s heart ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh the humanity, the humanity ...\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-44.html","bookId":1619,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM"}
