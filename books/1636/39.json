It would only weaken our forces here, and potentially leave any advance party facing Sentinels on the other side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him and sighed. \"I find myself reluctantly agreeing with your tactical analysis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt unholstered his M6 pistol and set it next to her. \"You may need this. Doctor. Keep your head down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the gun and racked the slide as if she had used one many times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt moved back to the upper ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elites had spread out in three lines. They presented Jackal shields, interlinked them, and started a slow advance toward the hill. This was another inspired tactic. If the Spartans fired at them, they\u0027d just burn through these disposable shields and would still have their personal overshields to contend with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter pairs towered in the center of the formations. The thick slabs of alloy they used for shields were impenetrable to any weapon they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt glanced to Ash standing by his side, and then to his pack on the ground. Inside were the two cut-down FENRIS warheads. Kurt double-checked the detonator control pad in his gauntlet\u0027s data socket. Still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All squads,\" Kurt ordered. \"Counter incoming enemy vectors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh and Olivia moved closer to Kurt at his seven o\u0027clock position. Kelly, Will, Holly, and Lucy clustered at four o\u0027clock. Chief Mendez, Fred, Mark, and Tom took position at twelve o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At fifty meters,\" Kurt continued, \"pitch grenades to break those lines, plasma first to drain shields, then the frags. Ignore the Hunters. Follow up with sniper fire. When they\u0027re close enough, use rifles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How close, sir?\" Holly asked. There was a quaver in her voice—not fear, but anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When they\u0027re on the stairs,\" Kurt told her. \"Kelly, stand ready with the LOTUS mines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt knew they couldn\u0027t stop them all. Some would get to the base of the hill. And some would climb the stairs. How many depended on their skill, timing, and a great deal of luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen acknowledgment lights flashed, and the Spartans tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advancing Elites were two hundred meters away. They hadn\u0027t fired a single shot yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever commanded them showed uncommon restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt searched for the glistening gold armor of a Ship or Fleet Master, but only saw the red battle gear of Covenant Majors on the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hundred meters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SPARTAN-IIIs shifted from foot to foot, a nervous gesture not mirrored in the battle- hardened SPARTAN-IIs whose bio signs on Kurt\u0027s tactical display barely showed a flutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Mendez caught Kurt\u0027s assessing look and gave him a confident nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what he and Mendez had trained the Spartans for their entire lives. They would survive this. They had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt fifty meters he spotted Elite soldiers opening and closing their four hinged jaws as if anticipating human blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Throw—now,\" Kurt ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlurred trajectories of burning blue plasma zipped through the air, followed by fragmentation grenades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advancing Elites hesitated, and a ripple distorted through their precise lines. The plasma grenades hit; there was a flash of blue-white that drained clusters of overlapping Jackal shields and knocked many Elites to their knees. Fragmentation grenades hit, bounced, and rolled into their ranks—and exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBodies and splashes of blood flew through the air; blue and red armor tumbled from the center of the blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt hefted his sniper rifle and targeted Elites still dazed, their overshields weakened and flickering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elite Majors growled orders, and the lines struggled to close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt squeezed off a shot, and the round tore through one Elite\u0027s open helmet, emerging out the back in a spray of blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Kurt\u0027s right and left came the popcorn crackle of single shots, and more Elites in the broken line fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree Elites stood their ground and returned fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlasma bolts impacted on the stone near Kurt\u0027s head. He felt the heat wash over his SPI armor plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what he had hoped for: chaos. He\u0027d happily exchange fire at this range when he had a scope, cover, and a superior angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Hunter bellowed in rage, lumbered to one of the Elites returning fire instead of re- forming the line, and hammered that Elite with one massive fist—crushing its spine. Turning, the Hunter screamed at the other two Elites and they quickly closed ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt kept firing, picking off stragglers as their formation knit together—shooting one Elite in the knee joint, one in the eye, until their Jackal shields overlapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a quick body count. Eleven down in the formation approaching his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued their advance to less than five meters from the base of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your fire,\" Kurt ordered. \"Kelly, LOTUS to standby\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flowerlike LOTUS antitank mines had been placed in the crux of the first steps and overlaid with a square of silver reflective blanket that served as camouflage in the brilliant light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo groups of five Elites split from their line and took up position to either side of the stairs, angling their shields toward the top. Five more Elites took cover behind them and opened fire. Plasma and crystal shards flashed up the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt ducked and the air scintillated overhead. He crawled to the edge and peered over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunters moved up the stairs followed by the balance of the Elite warriors… just passing the first step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" he told Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe LOTUS exploded into a multipetaled flash of lightning, thunder, and fire, enveloping the approaching force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concussive force roiled though Kurt\u0027s insides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree simultaneous sonic booms echoed off the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt popped up with his assault rifle and opened fire. Ash and Olivia were at his side, MA5Ks spitting rounds down the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter pair, halfway up the steps, stood stunned and bloodied by the concussive force, their impenetrable shields askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt aimed at the closest Hunter\u0027s unarmored center. Rounds tore into its exposed flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tangles of eels within his armor writhed and made the monster\u0027s bulk seem to boil. He grabbed his last plasma grenade, sidearmed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grenade stuck to the Hunter\u0027s abdomen—flashed, and ignited a dozen of the orange eel symbiotes constituting its form. Many fell out, aflame, burning and squealing on the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter staggered back and fell; the gestalt lost cohesion and spilled into a smoldering mound of worms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surviving Hunter ducked behind its shield, bellowing a vengeful cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt picked up a rifle and joined Ash and Olivia, combining fire to penetrate the overshields of the remaining Elite solders on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cluster of Elites at the base regrouped, their shields regenerated, and they returned fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh and Olivia ducked behind cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hill trembled behind Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and saw a Hunter pair plod onto the top at the four o\u0027clock position, flanked by a vanguard of three Elites with energy swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly reacted first, moved in, grabbed an Elite\u0027s wrist, and snapped it. She followed with an elbow to the Elite face— twisted the sword free and slashed, cutting it in half, as well as the two Elites on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun to face the Hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once in her life, she was too slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monsters had leveled their fuel-rod cannons at Kelly. They had her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly jumped between Kelly and the weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunters fired, outlining both Spartans in the blinding green radiation for a split second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overpressure of both point-blank fuel-rod cannon detonations threw Kelly, Will, and Lucy into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly exploded backward—a spray of molten SPI armor, disintegrating flesh, and jets of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt stood horrified, frozen, but then instincts and training clicked on full force, and without thinking, he rushed forward before the Hunters could finish his prone teammates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearest Hunter turned on him faster than he expected— slicing its two-ton shield into Kurt\u0027s solar plexus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outer layer of Kurt\u0027s armor cracked and the liquid ballistic underlayers failed and squirted out. Pain ripped through his torso; ribs cracked; he coughed and blood spattered the inside of his faceplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped in a heap at the Hunter\u0027s boots, dazed, only recovering his wits enough to see the Hunter raise both fists over him for the killing blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda\u0027s sniper rifle cracked. The exposed region of the Hunter\u0027s midsection exploded in a mass of orange, but it remained miraculously upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill hurled himself at the Hunter, and knocked the beast off its feet and into its mate— and the three of them tumbled down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt got up, ignoring the near-blinding pain, and limped to the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill stood between both Hunters at the base of the hill. He kicked the nearest in the unarmored middle and it staggered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him were a dozen Elites who, confronted by the sight of a lone Spartan engaging two Hunters in hand-to-hand combat, were momentarily too stunned to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt and Lucy opened fire, suppressing the Elites, before they regained their senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Hunter lashed out with its shield. Will ducked, darted inside its reach, and battered its bruised midsection—punching through flesh and ripping out wriggling chunks of the composite eel colony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second Hunter angled away from the fight and brought its cannon to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter shot him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s energy shield vanished, and the front of his MJOLNIR armor melted. He took a step toward the beast, and collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter turned and roared at the Spartans at the top of the hill, and then started to bring its tremendous shield back in line… A SPNKr missile screamed past Kurt\u0027s head, leaving a spiral of propellant exhaust, streaked toward the Hunter, and impacted dead center of its mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air erupted into a blurred sphere of explosive force. The nearby Elites were tossed aside like rag dolls, their shields flaring. The Hunter burst into a cloud of snakelike parts that wetly spattered upon the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt turned and saw Fred kneeling next to him, his spent SPNKr tube smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing moved. Not the Elites, the Hunters, or William.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly and Linda finally rose, shaking off the concussion from the fuel-rod cannon detonation. They stood with Kurt and Fred and stared at their fallen comrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was on his knees where Holly had stood a second ago. There were the outlines of two bootprints on the stone… nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Spartans down in a matter of seconds. One an old friend, the other a girl Kurt had known since she was four years old. Yet, he couldn\u0027t stop and think about it—not when they were surrounded by enemies. There were still many lives that were his responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt looked away and assessed the remaining threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia, posted at seven o\u0027clock, waved Kurt closer. He limped to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They just pulled back,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the hill base, the Hunter and the surviving Elites had re-formed their line and were retreating, already fifty meters away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt made his way to the twelve o\u0027clock point, to Mendez, Mark, and Tom. Chief Mendez met him. The old man had never looked so grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re pulling back here, too, sir,\" Mendez said. \"Doesn\u0027t make sense. Covenant always fight to the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt called up the roster on his display, still stained by his own blood, and checked TEAMBIO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s vitals were flatlined. Holly\u0027s signal… was entirely missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver TEAMCOM he said, \"Eyes peeled, everyone. Kelly, get Will. Linda, cover her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved, but no green acknowledgment lights flashed, the only sign of their numbing grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt sat down, suddenly too tired to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he noticed his bio signs: failing blood pressure, erratic heartbeat, electrolytes all wrong. There was internal bleeding. He found a can of biofoam, inserted its tip into his armor\u0027s mid line injection port, and emptied it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expanding liquid polymer chilled his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, and when he looked again his blood pressure had stabilized. His head had cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred made a short come-here gesture and Kurt groggily rose and went to his comrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" Fred pointed to far side of the core room. \"Three hundred fifty meters. Step up polarization to ninety-five percent, sir, and you\u0027ll see them.\" His voice trembled with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt darkened his faceplate, and then understood the reason for the Covenant\u0027s retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver a hundred fresh Elites massed behind energy-shield generators. Banshee fliers zipped back and forth over them. Plasma cannons were assembled by squads of Grunts. In the very front, Kurt spied a glint of gold armor, their leader— staring back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They softened us up before the main offensive,\" Kurt whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orders, sir?\" Fred asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the mental shock of losing Holly, Will, and Dante, and the physiological shock his body fought off, Kurt had forgotten he was in charge. His duty to get the alien technology and preserve the entire human race came back with crushing weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, there were few options left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could fight: advance to meet this new threat before their forces fully crystallized. In the open terrain though, without artillery or armor or air support, even Spartans would be cut down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could run: use the Slipspace rift in the core. The Covenant force would certainly follow, possibly destroy them, and gain more Forerunner technologies. That was not acceptable. Not when it had cost them so much to get this far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still his last option: the nukes. If he couldn\u0027t stop the Covenant, he could deny them their prize. He\u0027d take the warheads to the core and blow it all to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep me posted and stand by,\" he told Fred, and then limped down to the center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey met him. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered. \"Holly and Will—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped midsyllable and Kurt saw her glasses reflected the jiggling lines of his TEAMBIO signals. He had had no idea she could intercept their encrypted COM channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wounded,\" she stated, and seemed to stare into his body. \"Internal bleeding… your liver… massive laceration…\" Her gaze came back into focus, and her voice dropped to a whisper. \"You\u0027re going to bleed out, Kurt, if I don\u0027t operate. The only thing holding you together inside is biofoam.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-39.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
