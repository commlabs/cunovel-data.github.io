And BANG ME, BRETT! And my personal favorite, BRETT, I\u0027D HIT IT WITH YOU LIKE THE WRATH OF GOD!!! Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat were the chances? And Cary had known, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d known and hadn\u0027t warned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably thought it\u0027d be hysterical for me to find out by accident instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs loosened from around Gideon\u0027s hips and he set me down, protecting me from the frenzied fans with the shield of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to face the stage, feeling a mad fluttering in my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, it was Brett Kline at the mic, his deep, powerful, sexy-as-hell voice pouring over the thousands who\u0027d come to see him in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis short hair was spiked and tipped with platinum, his lean body clothed in olive cargo pants and a black tank top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible to see from where I was, but I knew his eyes were a brilliant emerald green, his face was ruggedly handsome, and his killer smile revealed a dimple that drove women crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTearing my eyes away from him, I looked at the other band members, recognizing all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn\u0027t been called Six-Ninths back in San Diego, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d been called Captive Soul then, and I wondered what had led to the name change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, aren\u0027t they?\" Gideon asked with his mouth to my ear so I could hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had one hand on the railing and the other around my waist, keeping me pulled up tight against him as he moved to the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combination of his body and Brett\u0027s voice did insane things to my already raging sex drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, focusing on the man behind me and the unique rush I\u0027d always felt while listening to Brett sing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music throbbed through my veins, bringing back memories - some good and some bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swayed in Gideon\u0027s arms, desire pounding through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was achingly aware of his hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt poured off him like heat waves, sinking into me, making me crave him until the physical distance between us was painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing the hand he had pressed flat against my stomach, I urged it downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was harsh with lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been pushing him all night, from the moment I told him my period was over, to the hand job beneath the restaurant table, to the scorching kiss in the intermission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped my bare thigh and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my left foot on the bottom of the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head fell back against his shoulder and a heartbeat later, his hand was under my skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue traced the shell of my ear, his breathing hard and fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him groan as much as heard it when he discovered how wet I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne song blended into another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon rubbed me through the crotch of my boyshorts, moving in circles, then vertically through my cleft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hips rolled into his touch, my core clenching, my ass grinding into the hard ridge of his erection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to come right there, inches away from dozens of people, because that was what Gideon did to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how insanely he turned me on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing mattered when his hands were on me, his attention completely riveted to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers pushed my underwear aside and two sank into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to fuck this gorgeous cunt for days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith bodies pressing in all around us, music pounding over us, and privacy granted only by distraction, Gideon slid his fingers deep into my soaked sex and stayed there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solid, unmoving penetration drove me wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ground my hips into his hand, working toward the orgasm I needed so desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song ended and the lights went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrenched in darkness, the crowd roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipation weighted the audience, building until the strum of guitar strings broke the heavy expectation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts rang out, then lighters flickered to life, turning the sea of people into thousands of fireflies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spotlight hit the stage, revealing Brett sitting on a bar stool, shirtless and glistening with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest was hard and defined, his abs ridged with muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the height of the microphone stand and the piercings in his nipples glittered with his movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women in the audience screamed, including Shawna, who jumped in place and gave an earsplitting whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI totally got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting there as he was, with his feet propped on the rungs of the chair and his muscular arms covered in sleeves of black and gray tattoos, Brett looked insanely sexy and extremely fuckable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor six months nearly four years ago I\u0027d debased myself to get him naked every chance I could, so infatuated with him and desperate to be loved that I took whatever scraps he threw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s fingers began to slide in and out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bass kicked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett began to sing a song I\u0027d never heard before, his voice low and soulful, the words crystal clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the voice of a fallen angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMesmerizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeductive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the face and body to enhance the temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden
