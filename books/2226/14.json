His employees and competitors knew him a sakuta same-the deadly shark. For three decade she\u0027d outguessed, outbid, and out advertised all the Japanese competition; now he was on the brink of becoming a giant in the world market as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to close the biggest deal of his life-a deal that would make his Numatech Corp. the Microsoft of the future. His blood was alive with the cool rush of adrenaline. Business was war-and war was exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Tokugen Numataka had been suspicious when the call had come three days ago, he now knew the truth. He was blessed with myouri-good fortune. The gods had chosen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a copy of the Digital Fortress pass-key,\" the American accent had said. \"Would you like to buy it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka had almost laughed aloud. He knew it was a ploy. Numatech Corp. had bid generously for Ensei Tankado\u0027s new algorithm, and now one of Numatech\u0027s competitors was playing games, trying to find out the amount of the bid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the pass-key?\" Numataka feigned interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. My name is North Dakota.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka stifled a laugh. Everyone knew about North Dakota. Tankado had told the press about his secret partner. It had been a wise move on Tankado\u0027s part to have a partner; even in Japan, business practices had become dishonorable. Ensei Tankado was not safe. But one false move by an overeager firm, and the pass-key would be published; every software firm on the market would suffer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka took a long pull on his Umami cigar and played along with the caller\u0027s pathetic charade. \"So you\u0027re selling your pass-key? Interesting. How does Ensei Tankado feel about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no allegiance to Mr. Tankado. Mr. Tankado was foolish to trust me. The pass-key is worth hundreds of times what he is paying me to handle it for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Numataka said. \"Your pass-key alone is worth nothing to me. When Tankado finds out what you\u0027ve done, he will simply publish his copy, and the market will be flooded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will receive both pass-keys,\" the voice said. \"Mr. Tankado\u0027s and mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka covered the receiver and laughed aloud. He couldn\u0027t help asking. \"How much are you asking for both keys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty million U.S. dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty million was almost exactly what Numataka had bid. \"Twenty million?\" He gasped in mock horror. \"That\u0027s outrageous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen the algorithm. I assure you it\u0027s well worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shit, thought Numataka. It\u0027s worth ten times that. \"Unfortunately,\" he said, tiring of the game, \"we both know Mr. Tankado would never stand for this. Think of the legal repercussions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caller paused ominously. \"What if Mr. Tankado were no longer a factor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka wanted to laugh, but he noted an odd determination in the voice. \"If Tankado were no longer a factor?\" Numataka considered it. \"Then you and I would have a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be in touch,\" the voice said. The line went dead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-14.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM"}
