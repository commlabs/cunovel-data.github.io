{"id":26735,"no":1,"title":"INTRODUCTION","content":"\u0026nbsp;My share in this little book on Voltaire is a very minor one. My old friend and colleague, Mr. J. M. Wheeler, had written the greater part of the following pages before he brought the enterprise to my attention. I went through his copy with him, and assisted him in making some alterations and additions. I also read the printer’s proofs, and suggested some further improvements—if I may call them so without egotism. This is all I have done. The credit for all the rest belongs to him. My name is placed on the title-page for two reasons. The first is, that I may now, as on other occasions, be associated with a dear friend and colleague in this tribute to Voltaire. The second is, that whatever influence I possess may be used in helping this volume to the circulation it deserves. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n FOOTE.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n November, 1891\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3218/87781.html","bookId":708,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:27:05 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:27:05 AM"}
