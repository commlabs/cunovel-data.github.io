We went into a dozen clubs that advertised live music. I got fed up halfway through the search and started sending Lou inside while I waited in the Chevy. We broke for dinner, didn\u0027t rush through our meals. We got back on the road just as aimless as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I steered us into a convenience store, and Lou ripped a phone book out of a booth. We sat in the car and flipped through the listings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dewey\u0027s Deck and Landing.\" Lou showed me the ad. \"Says live music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the address. It\u0027s close. Right off 200.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The phone\u0027s closer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a long day, man. I\u0027ll buy you a beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewey\u0027s was tucked in behind a Pizza Hut and near a small grocery market in a ratty little plaza. The gravel parking lot overflowed. We parked on the grass and had to pony up five bucks each to get in. The cover was for the band, but we found out quick it wasn\u0027t Spanklicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, I actually liked the music. I\u0027d never heard Spanklicious, but I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d be covering an Ella Fitzgerald tune. The gal on stage wore a long black dress, velvet gloves up to her elbows. Her voice was beautifully dark and raw. The four guys behind her knew what they were doing: horn, bass, guitar, upright piano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This ain\u0027t them,\" said Lou. \"You want to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hear a song,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s have a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music shifted into a hot swing number, and college kids decked out in vintage dresses, pinstriped suits, and wide ties flooded the sunken dance floor in front of the stage. The bar crowd looked wrong. Mixed. The dressed-up kids were there for the music. The frat guys were out of place, and there were a lot of them in white baseball caps, Greek letters on their sweatshirts. They were there just to get drunk, and they were good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou muscled his way to the crowded bar. He squeezed between two of the frat kids, jostling them out of the way. They turned to give him some lip, saw his size, and decided to pay closer attention to their drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou handed a plastic cup back toward me, and I took it. I tilted the contents back between my lips. It went down cheap and wet, cold and perfect. It had been a long day. A long, hard, bad couple of days. I made a mental note to call Ma later. And Marcie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe college kids were giving Lou a wide berth. The giant leaned back with both elbows spread along the rough wooden bar like he owned the joint, taking up more than his fair share of space considering the crowd. There\u0027d be trouble soon. I knew Lou\u0027s type. He wouldn\u0027t start anything, but he\u0027d throw his weight around until a drunk-enough kid took a poke at him. He needed to turn some kid\u0027s lights out to feel better, like he was in control of something, like his life hadn\u0027t just taken a nosedive. That was the type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to ask around,\" I told him and moved away into the mass of kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" he called after, but I just nodded pretending I\u0027d heard him wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished my beer as I reached the far end of the bar. It took me a minute to get the bartender\u0027s attention, but he spotted me as the band finished a song I didn\u0027t recognize heavy on the horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know a band called Spanklicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Smoke Up, Johnny.\" He pointed at the stage, shouting over the racket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean another band.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You want another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t ask what I was drinking, which was fine since I didn\u0027t know. He brought it back too foamy, and I tried again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other places around here have a band tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I know,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank, ordered a third, drank it, and ordered another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about the restroom when the girl onstage announced the band was taking a quick break. I circled the dance floor, plying my way through the crowd, found the men\u0027s room. The single urinal was mercifully free, so I unzipped and let out some beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone flushed in one of the stalls. The girl singer came out, fished a lipstick out of her purse and put the purse on the narrow shelf under the mirror. \"Don\u0027t mind me, hon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually only let sixty-year-old waitresses at truck stops and really fat table-dancers call me hon, but the singer was pretty, and I liked her voice, so I said, \"No problem at all, doll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at me sideways. Her lips curled into a little smile before she applied her dark lipstick. Her nose was a little too pointy, gave her a hawkish look. \"The line for the little girls\u0027 room is murder. I had to hold my bladder all the way through Tommy\u0027s horn solo.\" She shook her head like it was the saddest thing in the world. \"Nine minute fucking horn solo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left as some frat boys came in, and they paused, looking at the front of the restroom door to see if they had the right one. She was gone by the time they figured it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened my tie in the mirror, decided I wasn\u0027t impressing anyone, and pulled it loose again. I looked at my eyes. Red. Too much beer and not enough sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe singer\u0027s purse was still on the shelf. I grabbed it and left the restroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way back, I spotted Lou still guarding his territory near the bar. He was chatting up a busty coed in sorority letters, the frat guys still glowering over their shoulders at him. It wouldn\u0027t be long now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had another beer, remembered I had a purse in my hand, and found the singer on the steps that led up to the stage. She was on her way back up, and I asked her to wait a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t talk now,\" she said curtly. \"We\u0027re on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left this in the can.\" I held out the purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes softened. She took a step down. \"Thanks. I appreciate it.\" She grabbed the purse, but I hung on to the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know a band called Spanklicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. They come through every few months. Sounds like somebody throwing glass bottles into a buzz-saw. What do you want to hear them for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a fan. I\u0027m just looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They usually play at Caf¨¦ Blitzkrieg. It\u0027s a bottle club on 4th, or was. It burned down- shit- maybe a week, ten days ago. They always got shit bands. I don\u0027t think anyplace else in town would have them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of the purse. \"Sorry to trouble you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me sort of weird, curious. \"No trouble.\" She took the stage, and the band jerked to life with \"Hit that Jive Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back to Lou, he was having some hard words with one of the frat kids. Another came up behind him and broke a beer bottle at the base of his skull. Lou teetered, and the frat guys saw their chance. About eight dove on him. The guy behind the bar yelled. The band played louder, segued into \"Sing, Sing, Sing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou kicked out with a big boot and caught one in the stomach. The kid folded good, hit the floor hard. Lou grabbed a fistful of one\u0027s shirt and tossed him over the bar. The other guys were landing solid blows into Lou\u0027s midsection. They might as well have been punching a dump truck. I moved in to help, but I didn\u0027t hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the bigger frat guys threw a wooden chair. Lou ducked, and the chair sailed over the railing and down into the dance floor. It obliterated a couple who\u0027d been swing dancing pretty well up till then. All hell broke loose. Screaming. Some afraid. Most angry. A tiny girl heavy with rhinestones scooped up the chair and hurled it back. It landed on a crowded table, spraying beer in every direction. The guys at the table jumped the rail and waded into the swing kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncers arrived, two fat guys who didn\u0027t know where to start. They looked at Lou. They looked at the brawl on the dance floor. I guess they weren\u0027t ambitious enough to tackle Lou, so they headed for the dancers. The band had abandoned the set list and dove into a quirky cover of \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Around the Old Oak Tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou looked happy. He had a very picturesque dribble of blood in one corner of his mouth, and he planted a fist in the face of anyone who dared come within range. I picked a random kid and popped him in the mouth so I could feel involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis buddy aimed a fist at my nose. I turned and took it on the cheek. Then I leaned in with an uppercut that rattled his teeth and made the cartoon songbirds circle his head. He went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough, Lou,\" I shouted over the din. \"Let\u0027s go. Cops!\" I didn\u0027t really see any, but that would get him moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right behind you, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hammered one last kid on the top of his head with a meaty fist and kicked his limp form under a table, then followed me to the exit. The guy on the door looked nervous, held up a hand wondering how he was going to stop us, figured out he wasn\u0027t, and ducked behind the cash register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the parking lot, I backed the Suburban into a Mazda by accident in my hurry to leave before the cops arrived. I didn\u0027t hear any sirens, but it would be soon now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck, man,\" said Lou. \"Watch your driving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thing\u0027s the size of a battleship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got us away, pointed us toward the Interstate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, shit,\" said Lou, who grinned like he\u0027d just won the Nobel Prize for kicking ass. \"I guess we showed \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove into a cluster of restaurants and hotels where Interstate 75 intersected with 200. I got us a couple of rooms at the Best Western.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my room, I flipped on the light over the twin sinks, poked at the swollen area under my left eye where the kid had nailed me. I\u0027d had too much beer, gotten careless. A watery punch thrown by some college kid. Should have seen it coming. Stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flopped down on the bed, grabbed the phone, and dialed Marcie\u0027s number. She answered after eleven rings. \"Yes? Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound out of breath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ran in from the garage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working. I have three howler monkeys on ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have three- what\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got them from the Sanford Zoo,\" she said. \"They were free. Can you believe it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead monkeys. That\u0027s quite a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, ha. You think it\u0027s a big joke, but a friend of a friend owns an alternative art gallery in Jacksonville. You know Minnie Shwartz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She owns the gallery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minnie? No. Minnie owns squat. But she knows Naomi. Naomi runs the gallery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noami who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naomi nothing,\" said Marcie. \"It\u0027s one of those one word names. Like Cher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Zorro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hilarious.\" A pause. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holding my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d you call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to hear a friendly voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m as good as anyone?\" Her question was only half playful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that ain\u0027t true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you like me best, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like you best. What are you going to do with the monkeys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know yet, but I\u0027d better get started before they start going bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could do one of those see no, hear no, speak no evil things,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"You\u0027re wonderfully silly and clich¨¦. I have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful. Don\u0027t dead animals have parasites or ebola or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My monkeys are melting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about calling Ma, but it was getting late. I went back to the mirror and checked my bruise again. Stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d bought a toothbrush and some toothpaste and deodorant at the 7-Eleven a block from the hotel. I scrubbed my teeth. I\u0027d forgotten to buy a razor. My stubble was thick and dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a hard knock on the door. I opened it, and Lou was standing there shirtless with a little syringe sticking out of his upper arm like a stray pub dart. He was red faced, strands of blond hair matted to his forehead. His face was crinkled up like an actor\u0027s in a laxative commercial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to push it in, man. Make the juice go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you on the junk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I stuck it in a nerve or something. I can\u0027t get my other arm up to push it in.\" It was true. He tried to bring his other arm around but it froze up halfway like Frankenstein playing the violin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re shooting junk, I swear I\u0027ll fucking put a bullet in your face right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not dope, man. It\u0027s- It\u0027s part of my muscle building regimen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steroids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It hurts, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear that stuff shrivels your gonads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you just push it in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took hold of the syringe gently and thumbed down the contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the syringe out of his arm and dropped it on top of the television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arm was his again. He rubbed it, flexed. \"Yeah, man. Yeah!\" He slapped his muscles, flexed some more and dropped to the floor where he began doing push-ups. \"Feel the burn. Ride the burn. Oh, yeah.\" It didn\u0027t look like he was going to let up anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you shout slogans and sweat in your own room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not even midnight.
