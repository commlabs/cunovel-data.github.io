She gritted her teeth and forced herself to keep moving forward. Vomit raced up her throat, but she fought it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA narrow path stretched before her and behind her. Sheer walls rose to either side. A mist cloaked her ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mist screamed at her and hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clutched the Crescent Blade. She was not alone and she knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come out,\" she said, her voice low and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, the mist swirled and formed into a vast serpent whose body stretched behind it to infinity. Black, empty eyes stared into Halisstra\u0027s soul and pinioned her in place. The serpent opened its mouth and hissed. The sound turned Halisstra\u0027s legs to water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep within the serpent writhed the tiny, partially consumed essences of millions of failed souls. Their screams, rich with despair, fat with terror, bombarded Halisstra. She struggled to stand her ground. She saw her own fate in themshe too was a failed soulbut instead of causing her despair, it raised her anger. \"Face me,\" she said and did not know whether she was talking to the creature or to someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe serpent hissed again and slithered sinuously forward. The souls wailed their pain and terror with each movement of the creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra stared at the glowing souls and wondered for a moment if Ryld was trapped within the creature. She decided that she did not care and moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe roared, lifted the Crescent Blade, and charged, meeting the serpent\u0027s advance with one of her own. The miniature golems swarmed forward at Gromph. The transmutation that allowed him to fight prevented him from casting any spells to stop them, and he refused to abandon his station over the prismatic sphere atop the main body of the golem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smaller constructs scrabbled and leaped up the body of the golem to get a Gromph, thirty of them, forty. The archmage roared and brandished his axe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spider golem landed on his back, then another, and both bit into his flesh. Others clambered up his legs to beat at his chest. His armor spells deflected some but not all of their bites, and he grunted with pain over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed one of the creatures by a leg, threw it atop the body of the golem, and chopped it with his axe. He chopped another, and another, all the while waiting for the transformative spell to abate so that he could focus on the real issuethe prismatic sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his horror, the miniature golems that he struck split into smaller fragments and within a five count sprouted eight legs each and came at him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed, swung at more of the spiders, again and again. Each time he struck, the small constructs burst into pieces, and each piece itself became another, smaller spider golem. Killing one made five more. He was surrounded by a roiling swarm of constructs. They came at him from all sides, a swarm of fearless, remorseless killers. Eventually, he stopped chopping at them with his axe and instead tried to throw or push them off of the main body of the golem. But he could do only so much and in moments was covered in them, their weight so heavy that he could hardly move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to trigger the levitation power of his House Baenre brooch but the weight of the golems crawling over him was too much. He could not get airborne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir fangs and claws ripped through his defensive spells and into his flesh. He screamed with rage, pain, and frustration. His ring struggled to heal the wounds inflicted by the spiders, but there were too many. For every spider that he jerked from his body or threw down from atop the golem, another three took its place. He shook them from his hands, pried them from his face, pulled them from his legs. Agony lit him. He roared as he fought. If not for the regenerative magic of his ring, he would have been dead. With the suddenness of a whipdagger strike, his transformative spell ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowledge returned to him in a rush. Physical strength drained out of him, and he sagged under the burden of the golems. His understanding of combatswings, feints, and footworkfaded out of his memory like a half-remembered dream. His normal understanding of the Weavethe necessary gestures, component admixtures, the language of the arcanerefilled his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph was himself again, and he was in agony. A hundred holes pockmarked his flesh. Blood soaked his robe. In theory he could again cast spells, but the pain was too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking fast, he did the only thing he could. He leaped from atop the golem and hit the ground in a roll. The impact jarred many of the spiders loose. With fewer attached to him, he triggered the levitation magic inherent in his brooch and went airborne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook free the remaining spiders and hung in the air, gasping and breathing, dripping blood. Below him, a thousand eyes stared upward, tiny mandibles clicking, tiny pedipalps waving. His broach allowed him only vertical movement, so he took a feathera spell component difficult for him to procure in the Underdarkand spoke the words to a spell of flying. When he finished, he floated to his right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one, the swarm of spiders followed him, eyes turned upward. An idea occurred to him A sizzling sound from above and behind turned Gromph around. Green veins of magical energy arced along his wall of force. The Dyrr wizards were attempting to dispel it but their first attempt had failed. Gromph had to move fast. He flew farther to his right, drawing the swarm of golems away from the body of their destroyed parent. He took from his robe a finger-shaped lodestone, one end of which was covered in iron shavings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHovering above the swarm of golems, he incanted the words to a powerful transmutation. When he finished the casting, the shavings moved from one end of the lodestone to the other and within a cylindrical area that ran from floor to ceiling and included Gromph and all of the spider golems, up became down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the effect of his flying spell, Gromph simply adjusted his internal bearings, flipped over, and remained hovering in the air. The golems, however, fell up toward the ceiling, just as if they had stepped off a cliff. Gromph dodged them as they fell past. Two latched onto him, but he shook them free, and they too fell upward. All of them crashed into the ceiling, but it damaged them little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the entire swarm treating the ceiling as if it was the floor, Gromph spoke the words to another wall of force and ringed the area of effect in which he had reversed gravity. The golems would not be able to walk out of the affected area of his spell and fall to the floor. They were hedged in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph allowed himself no time to enjoy his victory. He flew down, flipped again when he left the affected area of his spell, landed atop the body of the parent golem, and looked down at the prismatic sphere, at the twine of the master ward that fed into it. He could have used one of his more powerful spells to disjoin the magic but doing so would negate all magic within the temple, triggering the master ward, freeing the golems, forcing his soul back into his body, and negating his walls of force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he would cancel the sphere with the methodical application of specific spells. Each of the seven colors of the sphere was negated by casting a certain spell on the sphere when the appropriately colored layer appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, Gromph thought through the spells he would need to eliminate the sphere\u0027s layers. Some of them would require material components. He reached into his robes and withdrew the materials he would need a tiny cone of glass, his lodestone, and a pinch of dried mushroom spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the prismatic sphere as it cycled through its colors. He had to down the colors in sequence, starting with red and moving to violet. The master ward complicated things potentially, but Gromph had no more time to worry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe readied his spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere showed red. Gromph incanted a couplet, put the glass cone to his lips, and exhaled a cone of freezing cold that slicked the floor in ice. The prismatic sphere froze in the ice. Gromph tapped it with his finger, and the red layer shattered and disappeared, revealing the orange layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother assault on the wall of force. The ang ry clicking of the golem swarm from above. Gromph ignored both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke another series of arcane words and summoned a powerful gust of wind. The magic of the spell whipped his hair into his face and tore the orange layer from the sphere, where it dissipated into nothingness. The yellow layer was revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his lodestone, gathered some of the dust from the floor, and spoke the words to the same spell that he had used to disintegrate Geremis. The spell annihilated the yellow layer, exposing the green. Gromph heard voices from outside the window. The screech of something powerful and predatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena must have brought the vrocks, he thought, recalling the shapechanged demons that had stood on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the mushroom spores and spoke aloud the words to a spell that ordinarily would have opened a hole through solid walls. Instead, the magic opened a tiny hole in the green layer, which rapidly expanded until the layer was consumed. The blue layer lay open to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vrocks screeched again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered the words to a simple evocation, pointed his finger, and discharged a bolt of magical energy. It struck the blue layer and consumed it, revealing a scarlet layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was nearly done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind and above him, another assault on his wall of force brought it down. A shower of sparks announced its fall. A victorious cry sounded from outside the window. Gromph could not halt his attack on the sphere to erect another defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the next layer, he closed his eyes and pronounced the words to the next spell. When it took effect, light as bright as the sun in the World Above illuminated the temple. Gromph\u0027s eyes watered even through his closed lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts of dismay sounded from outside the window. House Dyrr\u0027s forces no more liked light than did Gromph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness spells quickly countered the light, but the spell\u0027s work was done. The light had burned away the scarlet layer. Only one remainedviolet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph uttered the words to the spell he had used so many times over recent hours, the spell that dispelled other magic. When he pronounced the final syllable, the violet layer disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, exposed but for the twisting embrace of the master ward, lay the lichdrow\u0027s phylactery. It glowed so brightly in his magic-attuned vision that he had to again blink away tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phylactery looked like nothing more than a sparkling, fist-sized beljuril, a hard green gemstone. Tiny runes covered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin it, Gromph knew, was the lichdrow\u0027s essence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph hefted the duergar axe. Not only would a blow from the axe destroy the gem, it would drink the lichdrow\u0027s soul, such as it was. The thought pleased Gromph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, the vrocks streaked through the window and into the temple. Gromph spared a look back. The demons had assumed their natural form that of muscular, giant, bipedal vultures. Vicious talons ended their legs, and large, tearing beaks jutted from their twisted faces. The beat of their enormous wings carried the stench of carrion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is here!\" they shouted back outthe window, and Gromph heard exclamations of excitement from outside the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena appeared in the window, levitating high and stepping onto the sill. For a moment, she stared down with a confused expression at the ruined temple and Gromphhe still wore the body of her daughterbut her expression quickly changed to one of rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe guessed who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Archmage!\" she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph shot her a smile and raised the axe high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vrocks flew toward him as fast as arrows, mouths open wide and shrieking. Yasraena voiced the words to a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Dyrr,\" he said, and drove the axe into the beljuril.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gem shattered into countless glittering fragments, emitting a foul puff of smoke. A vague, distant howl sounded somewhere deep in Gromph\u0027s mind, and the axe shook in his hands. The lichdrow\u0027s soul rushed into the metal. It glowed, vibrated, and displaced the previous souls that the axe had claimed. A score or more spirits exploded from the axe head, exclaimed with joy at their freedom, and vanished into the aether. Henceforth, the axe would house only the lichdrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Yasraena screamed and lost the thread of her spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vein of the master ward turned a burning orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Gromph could reason out the meaning of the change in the master ward, before he could turn to face the onrushing vrocks, a tremor shook the temple, shook all of House Agrach Dyrr. The force of it knocked Gromph off of the remains of the golem, and thevrocks shrieked past him overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking as quickly as he could, Gromph uttered the incantation to one of his most powerful spells. Time stopped for everyone but Gromph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell. Motion ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vrocks hung frozen in mid-air, mouths agape. Yasraena stood in the window, frozen in the middle of another casting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph studied the vein of the master ward. A bubble of power distorted its otherwise straight line, just where it passed through the temple doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Gromph a moment to determine what had happened. He cast a series of divinations to confirm his suspicions. When he saw the results, he almost laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lichdrow\u0027s defenses never ended. And it appeared he would have his revenge, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe master ward had reset the wards behind Gromph not to prevent a second intruder from entering but to provide a power source for its real purpose. The destruction of the phylactery had triggered the lichdrow\u0027s final spell, a cyclic reaction that fed on the reset wards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower would race back along the vein of the master ward, absorbing the energy of all of the wards in its path. When it reached the start of the spell network, it would rebound back to its place of originthe location of the phylactery, the templebringing with it all of the pent-up power of the absorbed wards. The explosion would be enormous, perhaps large enough to level the entire stalagmite fortress complex of House Agrach Dyrr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph could not flee. The dimensional lock prevented magical travel, and he could never get out on foot in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lichdrow had ensured that he would not go alone into oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done,\" Gromph said to the axe, though he knew the lichdrow could not hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage smiled at the symmetry. He had destroyed the lichdrow\u0027s body by breaking and exploding his staff of power. The lichdrow would destroy Gromph\u0027s body by breaking and exploding all of House Agrach Dyrr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing else for it. Gromph\u0027s timestop spell was about to end. He decided that he would rather die in his own body than that of some Dyrr priestess. He decided too that he would die amused. The battle of spells and wits, of moves and countermoves, had been as good as any sava game he\u0027d ever played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke the words to a minor transmutation and transformed Larikal\u0027s body to look more like his ownshorter, slimmer, with shorter hair and sharper features. The likeness was rough but probably good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite his timestop spell, he sensed the master ward collecting power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an exercise of will, he returned his soul to the ocular, forcing Larikal back into her own form. Once inside the gem, he quickly moved back into his own shrunken, invisible body. He came back to himself outside the temple, small and unseen, awaiting his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena blinked in surprise but managed to hold onto the thread of her spell. For a moment, Gromph Baenre had appeared cloaked in an illusion as her daughter Larikal, but the illusion had expired, and the Archmage of Menzoberranzan stood revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vrocks streaked in, biting with their beaks and tearing with their claws. The archmage appeared disoriented, reaching for weapons at his waist that did not exist, lashing out with fists rather than spells. His screams sounded like those of a woman. He found the axe he had used to destroy the lichdrow\u0027s phylactery and swung it awkwardly at the circling vrocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena continued her spell. She would annihilate the archmage. A bottomless ocean of pent up anger flowed into the casting, powering itrage at Gromph for his deception, rage at the lichdrow for the foolish, short-sighted plotting that had brought her House down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother tremor nearly shook her from the window perch, but still she continued the chant. Flecks of stone rained from the temple dome. Glass cracked. The entirety of House Agrach Dyrr was shaking. She saw it then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sense of certainty that opened a hole in her stomach, she knew that House Agrach Dyrr was destroyed. The archmage had destroyed the phylactery, and the fool lichdrow had triggered some retaliative magic that would bring the entire complex down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter, she thought. She would kill the archmage. Matron Mother Yasraena would die with at least that satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words poured out of her, and power gathered with every syllable. The vrocks continued to attack, harrying Gromph from either side. He comported himself well with the axe. He fought back the vrocks and looked up at Yasraena. His expression went wide-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouted something but she could not hear it over the shaking temple, over the boom of her own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finished the spell, pointed her holy symbol at the archmage, and let its energy take root in his body. She knew he would be warded, but she also knew his wards would fail him. She had put all of her power into the spell. No one could resist it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill staring at her, the archmage began to shake. His entire body quaked as much as the temple and the rest of the fortress. Sounds poured from his mouth but Yasraena could not understand them. The vrocks backed off, unsure of what had occurred. Yasraena touched her House brooch and used its levitation magic to lower herself to the shaking temple floor. She wanted to watch Gromph die up close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are but a male, Archmage,\" she said. \"And I will watch you did before Lolth claims me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magic took deeper root. Gromph struggled to say something to her but could not control his body. His tongue flopped between his lips. He gagged, bit down on his tongue, and sprayed spit and blood. A horrible gargling noise escaped his lips as his body began to shrink in on itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, as the body collapsed, Yasraena saw Gromph\u0027s features contort to reveal. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larikal?\" Yasraena rushed forward and took the archmage\u0027s imploding body in her hands. \"Larikal!\" She could see the archmageno, her daughtertrying to nod through her spasms. The quaking grew more and more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena could not stop the spell. It was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother, Larikal croaked through the connection of their telepathic amulets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena could not respond before her daughter\u0027s mental voice became a prolonged scream, then turned into an incoherent, pain-riddled gobbling. With a wet, tearing sound, her body folded in on itself over and over and over again until it was nothing more than a densely packed ball of flesh at Yasraena\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasraena stared down at her daughter\u0027s remains and clenched her fists in rage. The archmage had deceived her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove her, the dome began to crack. She stared up and looked into Lolth\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood-spattered and gasping for breath, Halisstra stood on the landing outside the doors of Lolth\u0027s pyramidal tabernacle. To her left and right lay the corpses of Danifae and Quenthel. Halisstra had killed them both, cut them nearly to shreds with the Crescent Blade. In her rage, she had left Danifae little more than a pile of bloody, shapeless flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had stopped them both from entering the tabernacle. Neither would be Lolth\u0027s Yor\u0027thae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unstrapped her shield and cast it to the stone landing. The rattle sounded loud in the silence. Except for the occasional sigh of the violet fires on the Planes of Soulfire behind and below her, the entirety of the Demonweb Pits seemed to be holding its breath. Even Lolth\u0027s wind had died down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at the massive, pyramidal structure before herLolth\u0027s tabernacle, composed of black metal and acrawl with spiders. At its base, the towering double doors stood open and beckoning. Violet light leaked from within. Halisstra saw arachnid silhouettes in the lighthuge, predatory forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she would do what she had come to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had she come to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her headher thoughts were confusedand stepped across the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebs covered the slanting walls of the temple\u0027s interior, their collective pattern suggestive of something disquieting but indiscernible. Spiders of all shapes and sizes skittered through the webs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColumns dotted the structure, slender spires fashioned of hardened, twisted web strands. She could not see the source of the violet light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the far end of the web-strewn temple, standing on a raised dais of polished, black granite, stood the eight bodies of the Spider Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing her former patron goddess in the flesh, Halisstra found it difficult to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth was in her arachnid forms and appeared as eight giant widows, graceful and deadlyone goddess, eight aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven of the widows crawled over each other, hissed at each other, as though fighting for position. But all of them stood behind the eighth, the largest, who sat quiescent in her web. The eyes of the eighth impaled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA yochlol stood to either side of the dais, their forms like melted wax, their waving arms like ropes. Creatures that Halisstra had never before seen lined a processional directly between Halisstra and Lolth. Their tall, graceful formsnude drow females sprouting long spider legs from their torsosloomed over Halisstra. Halisstra felt their eyes on her too, and the weight of their expectations. She marveled at the grace of their forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not the one!\" she shouted, and the webs swallowed her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eighth spider stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustle ran through the ranks of the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one, the drow-spider creatures responded, \"But you could be. The eighth awaits the Yor\u0027thae.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hissed and bared their teeth, revealing a spider\u0027s fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eight bodies of Lolth clicked as one, and the widows fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cocked their beautiful heads, listening to their goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra brandished the Crescent Blade, drew in a deep breath, and took another step into the temple. The doors swung closed behind her with a boom. She stopped for a moment, uncertain, trapped, alone. She looked down the aisle at Lolth and somehow found a reserve of courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will face you for what you have done to me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe widows rustled. The yochlols waved their ropy arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have done it to yourself, Lolth answered in Halisstra\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goddess\u0027s voicevoices, for Halisstra heard seven distinct tones in the wordsnearly drove Halisstra to her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the Crescent Blade in both sweating hands, her knuckles white, Halisstra took another step, then another. The blade shimmered in her grasp, its crimson fire a counterpoint to the temple\u0027s violet light. Halisstra might have no longer served the Dark Maiden,but Eilistraee\u0027s sword still wanted to do the work for which it was designed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange drow-spiders eyed her as she walked between them but made no move to stop her. They shifted uneasily with each step that she took nearer to Lolth\u0027s forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra was shaking, her legs felt leaden, but she kept moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven sets of mandibles churned as Halisstra got closer. The eighth body of Lolth stood still, waiting. Halisstra stepped to the base of the dais, before the bodies of Lolth, and looked into the emotionless eye-cluster of the eighth spider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw herself reflected in those black orbs and did not care for how she appeared. Her heart pounded in her breast, so hard it surely must burst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweating, gritting her teeth, she lifted the Crescent Blade high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth\u0027s voices, soft, reasonable, and persuasive, sounded in Halisstra\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy have you come, daughter? Lolth asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not your daughter, Halisstra answered. And I\u0027ve come to kill you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tightened her grip on the Crescent Blade. Its light shone in Lolth\u0027s eight eyes, reminding Halisstra of the satellites in the sky of the Demonweb Pits that had watched her from on high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yochlol to Lolth\u0027s sides slithered toward Halisstra, but Lolth\u0027s forms stopped them with a wave of their pedipalps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could not even if you willed it, Lolth said. But I see your heart, daughter, and I know that you do not will it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra hesitated, the Crimson Blade poised to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not me that you wish to kill, child, said Lolth. I am what I am and you have always known that. I kill, I feed, and in that killing and feeding I am made stronger. Why does your own nature trouble you so? My daughter\u0027s worship ill-suited you. Why do you fear to admit what you want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crescent Blade shook in Halisstra\u0027s hand. Tears welled in her eyes. She realized it then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not Lolth that she wanted to kill. She wanted to kill the uncertainty, the dichotomy in her soul that had spawned her weakness. She knew it lingered there still, a guilty, fearful hole. She had raised a temple to Eilistraee in the Demonweb Pits, had slain countless spiders holy to Lolth, had wielded the Dark Maiden\u0027s own blade. Her final rejection of Eilistraee was inadequate penance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved Lolth, longed for the Spider Queen, or at least the power that Lolth brought. That was what she wanted to killthe longingbut she could not, not without killing herself and who she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbrace what you are, child, Lolth said in a chorus of seven voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was eight sets of mandibles that opened wide. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/resurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-6/page-17.html","bookId":2164,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM"}
