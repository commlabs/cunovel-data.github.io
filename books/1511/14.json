Regardless of how much mana it had, that number of births was rare and beyond measure. However, if it had a healing ability, he could understand that many births in that short amount of time.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027Catapult, which would pull out a finger and launch it, and Regeneration which would restore that bone... who would have thought I would find such a perfect match in the same dungeon.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In any case, he had survived because of those two skills.

He did see some of the greatswords that the Skeleton Warrior\u0027s had used remaining, but there weren\u0027t any spears.
