For the moment, however, you are now in my custody.’ He gestured to one of his guards. ‘Shackle them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg turned the corner leading into the narrow lane only to find it blocked by a freshly killed steer, legs akimbo, white tongue lolling as Ublala Pung-an arm wrapped about the beast’s broken neck-grunted and pulled, his face red and the veins on his temples purple and bulging. The odd multiple pulsing of his hearts visibly throbbed on both sides of the Tarthenal’s thick neck as he endeavoured to drag the steer to Tehol’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis small eyes lit up on seeing Bugg. ‘Oh good. Help.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where did you get this? Never mind. It will never fit in through the door, Ublala. You’ll have to dismember it out here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh.’ The giant waved one hand. ‘I’m always forgetting things.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ublala, is Tehol home?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. Nobody is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not even Janath?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tarthenal shook his head, eyeing the steer, which was now thoroughly jammed in the lane. ‘I’ll have to rip its legs off,’ he said. ‘Oh, the hens are home, Bugg.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg had been growing ever more nervous with each step that had brought him closer to their house, and now he understood why. But he should have been more than just nervous. He should have known. My mind-1 have been distracted. Distant worshippers, something closer to hand…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg clambered over the carcass, pushing past Ublala Pung, which, given the sweat lathering the huge man, proved virtually effortless, then hurried to the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shutter was broken, torn from its flimsy hinges. Inside, four hens marched about on the floor like aimless soldiers. Ublala Pung’s pillow was trying to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. They’ve got them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be a scene at the headquarters of the Patriotists. Couldn’t be helped. Wholesale destruction, an Elder God’s rage unleashed-oh, this was too soon. Too many heads would look up, eyes narrowing, hunger bursting like juices under the tongue. Just stay where you are. Stay where you are, lcarium. Lifestealer. Do not reach for your sword, do not let your brow knit. No furrows of anger to mar your unhuman face. Stay, lcarium!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the room, found a large sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala Pung filled the doorway. ‘What is happening?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg began throwing their few possessions into the sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bugg?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snatched up a hen and stuffed it in, then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bugg?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mobile pillow went last. Knotting the sack, Bugg turned about and gave it to Ublala Pung. ‘Find somewhere else to hide out,’ Bugg said. ‘Here, it’s all yours-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But what about the cow?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s a steer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I tried but it’s jammed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ublala-all right, stay here, then, but you’re on your own. Understand?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where are you going? Where is everyone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Bugg told him then, in clear terms that Ublala Pung would comprehend, all might well have turned out differently. The Elder God would look back on this one moment, over all others, during his extended time of retrospection that followed. Had he spoken true-‘They’re just gone, friend, and none of us will be back. Not for a long time. Maybe never. Take care of yourself, Ublala Pung, and ‘ware your new god-he is much more than he seems.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Bugg was outside, climbing over the carcass once more and to the mouth of the alley. Where he halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would be looking for him. On the streets. Did he want a running battle? No, just one single strike, one scene of unveiled power to send Patriotist body parts flying. Fast, then done. Before I awaken the whole damned menagerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I need to move unseen now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elder God stirred power to life, power enough to pluck at his material being, disassembling it. No longer corporeal, he slipped down through the grimy cobbles of the street, into the veins of seepwater threading the entire city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, much swifter here, movement as fast as thought-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tripped the snare before he was even aware that he had been pulled off course, drawn like an iron filing to a lodestone. Pulled, hard and then as if in a whirlpool, down to a block of stone buried in darkness. A stone of power-of Mael’s very own power-a damned altar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagerly claiming him, chaining him as all altars sought to do to their chosen gods. Nothing of sentience or malice, of course, but a certain proclivity of structure. The flavour of ancient blood fused particle by particle into the stone’s crystalline latticework. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-312.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
