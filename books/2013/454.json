And in the shaking repercussions of falling structures, buried foundations shifted, cracked, slumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely noticed amidst all the others, then, the explosion that tore up through that canal in a spray of sludge and water was relatively minor, yet it proved singular in one detail, for as the muddy rain of the canal’s water sluiced down onto the still-buckling streets, a figure clawed up from the canal, hands reaching for mooring rungs, pulling itself from the churning foam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho stood, ragged tunic streaming brown water, and did not move while chaos and spears of blinding light tore through Letheras. Who remained motionless, indeed, after those terrifying events vanished and faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorn between incandescent rage and dreadful fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of who he was, the fear won out. Not for himself, of course, but for a mortal man who was, the old man knew, about to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he would not reach him in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, so it would be rage after all. Vengeance against the Errant would have to wait its turn. First, vengeance against a man named Karos Invictad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael, Elder God of the Seas, had work to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil and the Adjunct rode side by side at the head of the column of cavalry. Directly ahead they could see the west wall of the city. Enormous cracks were visible through the dust, and the gate before them remained open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horses were winded, their breaths gusting from foam-flecked nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct, was that munitions?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore glanced across, then shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not a chance,’ Masan Gilani said behind them. ‘Only a handful of crackers in the whole lot. Something else did all that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara twisted in her saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiding beside Masan Gilani was Sinn. Not riding well, either. Gilani was staying close, ready to reach out a steadying hand. The child seemed dazed, almost drunk. Lostara swung back. ‘What’s wrong with her?’ she asked the Adjunct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the road’s slope climbed towards the gate, they could see the river on their left. Thick with sails. The Malazan fleet and the two Thrones of War had arrived. The main army was only two or three bells behind the Adjunct’s column, and Fist Blistig was pushing them hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That gate’s not going to close ever again,’ Lostara observed. ‘In fact, I’m amazed it’s still up.’ Various carved blocks in the arch had slipped down, jamming atop the massive wooden doors, which served to bind them in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they rode up, two marines emerged from the shadows. Had the look of heavies, and both were wounded. The Dal Honese one waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReining in before them, the Adjunct was first to dismount, one gloved hand reaching for her sword as she approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re holding still,’ the Dal Honese marine said. Then he raised a bloodied arm. ‘Bastard cut my tendon-it’s all rolled up under the skin-see? Hurts worse than a burr in the arse… sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct walked past both marines, into the shadow of the gate. Lostara gestured for the column to dismount, then set out after Tavore. As she came opposite the marines, she asked, ‘What company are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Third, Captain. Fifth Squad. Sergeant Badan Gruk’s squad. I’m Reliko and this oaf is Vastly Blank. We had us a fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnward, through the dusty gloom, then out into dusty, smoke-filled sunlight. Where she halted, seeing all the bodies, all the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct stood ten paces in, and Keneb was limping towards her and on his face was desperate relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, they had them a fight all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Hunch Arbat walked into the cleared space and halted beside the slumbering figure in its centre. He kicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala Pung’s eyes flickered open, stared up uncompre-hendingly for a long moment, then the Tarthenal sat up. ‘Is it time?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Half the damned city’s fallen down which is worse than Old Hunch predicted, isn’t it? Oh yes it is, worse and more than worse. Damned gods. But that’s no mind to us, Old Hunch says.’ He cast a critical eye on the lad’s efforts, then grudgingly nodded. ‘It’ll have to do. Just my luck, the last Tarthenal left in Letheras and he’s carrying a sack of sunbaked hens.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Ublala stretched a foot over and nudged the sack. There was an answering cluck and he smiled. ‘They helped me clean,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Hunch Arbat stared for a moment, then he lifted his gaze and studied the burial grounds. ‘Smell them? Old Hunch does. Get out of this circle, Ublala Pung, unless you want to join in.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-454.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
