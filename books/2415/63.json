No symptoms have been reported yet, but we’ve isolated samples and are already gearing up for intensive testing. Unfortunately, it could take days or weeks to get a real grip on what this virus is … and what it might do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a vector virus,” Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey cocked her head in surprise, startled to hear that he even knew the term. “I beg your pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zobrist created an airborne vector virus capable of modifying human DNA.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey rose abruptly, knocking her chair over in the process. That’s not even possible! “What would ever make you claim such a thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sienna,” Langdon replied quietly. “She told me. Half an hour ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey leaned her hands on her desk and stared across at Langdon with sudden distrust. “She didn’t escape?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She certainly did,” he replied. “She was free, in a boat speeding out to sea, and she easily could have disappeared forever. But she thought better of it. She came back of her own volition. Sienna wants to help with this crisis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA harsh laugh escaped Sinskey’s lips. “Forgive me if I’m not inclined to trust Ms. Brooks, especially when she’s making such a far-fetched claim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe her,” Langdon said, his tone unwavering. “And if she claims that this is a vector virus, I think you’d better take her seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey felt suddenly exhausted, her mind struggling to analyze Langdon’s words. She moved to the window and stared out. A DNA-altering viral vector? As improbable and horrifying as the prospect sounded, she had to admit there was an eerie logic to it. After all, Zobrist was a genetic engineer and knew firsthand that the smallest mutation in a single gene could have catastrophic effects on the body—cancers, organ failure, and blood disorders. Even a disease as abhorrent as cystic fibrosis—which drowns its victim in mucus—was caused by nothing more than a minuscule hiccup in a regulator gene on chromosome seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecialists had now started treating these genetic conditions with rudimentary vector viruses that were injected directly into the patient. These noncontagious viruses were programmed to travel through the patient’s body and install replacement DNA that fixed the damaged sections. This new science, however, like all sciences, had a dark side. The effects of a vector virus could be either favorable or destructive … depending on the engineer’s intentions. If a virus were maliciously programmed to insert damaged DNA into healthy cells, the results would be devastating. Moreover, if that destructive virus were somehow engineered to be highly contagious and airborne …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospect made Sinskey shudder. What genetic horror has Zobrist dreamed up? How does he plan to thin the human herd?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey knew that finding the answer could take weeks. The human genetic code contained a seemingly infinite labyrinth of chemical permutations. The prospect of searching its entirety in hopes of finding Zobrist’s one specific alteration would be like looking for a needle in a haystack … without even knowing on what planet that particular haystack was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elizabeth?” Langdon’s deep voice pulled her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey turned from the window and looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear me?” he asked, still seated calmly. “Sienna wanted to destroy this virus as much as you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I sincerely doubt that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon exhaled, standing now. “I think you should listen to me. Shortly before his death, Zobrist wrote a letter to Sienna, telling her what he had done. He outlined exactly what this virus would do … how it would attack us … how it would achieve his goals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey froze. There’s a letter?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When Sienna read Zobrist’s description of what he had created, she was horrified. She wanted to stop him. She considered his virus so dangerous that she didn’t want anybody to gain access to it, including the World Health Organization. Don’t you see? Sienna has been trying to destroy the virus … not release it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a letter?” Sinskey demanded, her focus now singular. “With specifics?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what Sienna told me, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need that letter! Having specifics could save us months in understanding what this thing is and knowing how to handle it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon shook his head. “You don’t understand. When Sienna read Zobrist’s letter, she was terrified. She burned it immediately. She wanted to be sure nobody—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey smacked her hand down on the desk. “She destroyed the one thing that could help us prepare for this crisis? And you want me to trust her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it’s asking a lot, in light of her actions, but rather than castigating her, it might be helpful to remember that Sienna has a unique intellect, including a rather startling capacity for recall.” Langdon paused. “What if she can re-create enough of Zobrist’s letter to be helpful to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey narrowed her gaze, nodding slightly. “Well, Professor, in that case, what do you suggest I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon motioned to her empty coffee cup. “I suggest you order more coffee … and listen to the one condition that Sienna has requested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey’s pulse quickened, and she glanced at the phone. “You know how to reach her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what she requested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon told her, and Sinskey fell silent, considering the proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s the right thing to do,” Langdon added. “And what do you have to lose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If everything you’re saying is true, then you have my word.” Sinskey pushed the phone toward him. “Please make the call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Sinskey’s surprise, Langdon ignored the phone. Instead, he stood up and headed out the door, stating that he would be back in a minute. Puzzled, Sinskey walked into the hall and observed him striding through the consulate’s waiting area, pushing open the glass doors, and exiting into the elevator foyer beyond. For a moment, she thought he was leaving, but then, rather than summoning the elevator, he slipped quietly into the women’s restroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, he emerged with a woman who looked to be in her early thirties. Sinskey needed a long moment to accept the fact that this was truly Sienna Brooks. The pretty ponytailed woman she had seen earlier in the day had been utterly transformed. She was totally bald, as if her scalp had been shaved clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the two entered her office, they silently took seats facing the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forgive me,” Sienna said quickly. “I know we have a lot to discuss, but first, I was hoping you would permit me to say something that I really need to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey noted the sadness in Sienna’s voice. “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ma’am,” she began, her voice frail, “you are the director of the World Health Organization. You know better than anyone that we are a species on the edge of collapse … a population out of control. For years, Bertrand Zobrist attempted to engage with influential people like yourself to discuss the impending crisis. He visited countless organizations that he believed could effect change—Worldwatch Institute, the Club of Rome, Population Matters, the Council on Foreign Relations—but he never found anyone who dared engage in a meaningful conversation about a real solution. You all responded with plans for better contraceptive education, tax incentives for smaller families, and even talk of colonizing the moon! It’s no wonder Bertrand lost his mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey stared at her, offering no reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna took a deep breath. “Dr. Sinskey, Bertrand came to you personally. He begged you to acknowledge that we are on the brink … begged you to engage in some kind of dialogue. But rather than listening to his ideas, you called him a madman, put him on a watch list, and drove him underground.” Sienna’s voice grew heavy with emotion. “Bertrand died all alone because people like yourself refused to open your minds enough even to admit that our catastrophic circumstances might actually require an uncomfortable solution. All Bertrand ever did was speak the truth … and for that, he was ostracized.” Sienna wiped her eyes and gazed across the desk at Sinskey. “Believe me, I know what it’s like to feel all alone … the worst kind of loneliness in the world is the isolation that comes from being misunderstood. It can make people lose their grasp on reality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna stopped talking, and a strained silence followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all I wanted to say,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey studied her for a long while and then sat down. “Ms. Brooks,” she said, as calmly as possible, “you’re right. I may not have listened before …” She folded her hands on the desk and looked directly at Sienna. “But I’m listening now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 102\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clock in the Swiss Consulate’s lobby had long since chimed 1 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe notepad on Sinskey’s desk was now a patchwork of handwritten text, questions, and diagrams. The director of the World Health Organization had neither moved nor spoken in more than five minutes. She stood at the window, staring out into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, Langdon and Sienna waited, seated in silence, cradling the last of their Turkish coffee, the heavy aroma of its pulverized grounds and pistachio grains filling the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only sound was the buzz of the fluorescent lights overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna could feel her own heart pounding, and she wondered what Sinskey was thinking, having now heard the truth in brutal detail. Bertrand’s virus is a sterility plague. One third of the human population will be infertile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the explanation, Sienna had watched Sinskey’s range of emotions, which, while restrained, had been palpable. First, there was a stunned acceptance of the fact that Zobrist had actually created an airborne vector virus. Next she had displayed fleeting hope when she learned that the virus was not designed to kill people. Then … slowly, there had been the spiraling horror as the truth set in, and she realized that vast portions of the earth’s population would be rendered sterile. It was clear that the revelation that the virus attacked human fertility affected Sinskey on a deeply personal level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Sienna’s case, the overwhelming emotion was relief. She had shared the complete contents of Bertrand’s letter with the WHO director. I have no more secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elizabeth?” Langdon ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey emerged slowly from her thoughts. When she returned her gaze to them, her face was drawn. “Sienna,” she began, speaking in a flat tone, “the information you have provided will be very helpful in preparing a strategy to deal with this crisis. I appreciate your candor. As you know, pandemic vector viruses have been discussed theoretically as a possible way to immunize large populations, but everyone believed that the technology was still many years away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey returned to her desk, where she sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forgive me,” she said, shaking her head. “This all feels like science fiction to me at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprising, Sienna thought. Every quantum leap in medicine had always felt this way—penicillin, anesthesia, X-rays, the first time humans looked through a microscope and saw a cell divide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Sinskey gazed down at her notepad. “In a few hours, I will arrive in Geneva to a firestorm of questions. I have no doubt that the first question will be whether there is any way to counteract this virus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna suspected she was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And,” Sinskey continued, “I imagine the first proposed solution will be to analyze Bertrand’s virus, understand it as best as we can, and then attempt to engineer a second strain of it—a strain that we reprogram in order to change our DNA back to its original form.” Sinskey did not look optimistic as she turned her gaze to Sienna. “Whether a countervirus is even possible remains to be seen, but hypothetically speaking, I’d like to hear your thoughts on that approach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts? Sienna felt herself glance reflexively at Langdon. The professor gave her a nod, sending a very clear message: You’ve come this far. Speak your mind. Tell the truth as you see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna cleared her throat, turned to Sinskey, and spoke in a clear, strong voice. “Ma’am, the world of genetic engineering is one I’ve inhabited with Bertrand for many years. As you know, the human genome is an extremely delicate structure … a house of cards. The more adjustments we make, the greater the chances we mistakenly alter the wrong card and bring the entire thing crashing down. My personal belief is that there is enormous danger in attempting to undo what has already been done. Bertrand was a genetic engineer of exceptional skill and vision. He was years ahead of his peers. At this point in time, I’m not sure I would trust anyone else to go poking around in the human genome, hoping to get it right. Even if you designed something you thought might work, trying it would involve reinfecting the entire population with something new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very true,” Sinskey said, seeming unsurprised by what she had just heard. “But of course, there is the bigger issue. We might not even want to counteract it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words caught Sienna off guard. “I’m sorry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ms. Brooks, I may disagree with Bertrand’s methods, but his assessment of the state of the world is accurate. This planet is facing a serious overpopulation issue. If we manage to neutralize Bertrand’s virus without a viable alternate plan … we are simply back at square one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna’s shock must have been apparent, because Sinskey gave her a tired chuckle and added, “Not a viewpoint you expected to hear from me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna shook her head. “I guess I’m not sure what to expect anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then perhaps I can surprise you again,” Sinskey went on. “As I mentioned earlier, leaders from top health agencies around the world will be gathering in Geneva in a matter of hours to discuss this crisis and prepare an action plan. I can’t recall a gathering of greater significance in all my years at the WHO.” She leveled her gaze at the young doctor. “Sienna, I would like you to have a seat at that table.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inferno-robert-langdon-4/page-63.html","bookId":2415,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM"}
