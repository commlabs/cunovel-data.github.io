It was a quieter meal than dinner had been the night before; the first flush of her excitement was gone, and I noticed again those violet smudges, shadows on snow, under her eyes. Her eyes themselves looked dark this morning, clouded. She had a few freckles on her nose that I hadn\u0027t registered before, tiny shavings, completely unlike Kate\u0027s. \"Did you have a bad night?\" I asked, at the risk of courting one of her stern glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"I was thinking about how much I\u0027ve told you about Robert, so many private things, and how you were sitting there in your hotel room thinking about it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know I was thinking about it?\" I passed her a plate of toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have been,\" she said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was. I think about this constantly. You are remarkable to let me see so much of him, and your doing that will help me more than anything has, to help Robert.\" I paused, feeling my way while she let her toast get cold. \"And I see why you waited for him for a long time, when he was unavailable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unattainable,\" she corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why you love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loved him, not love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t hoped for this much, and I focused on my eggs Benedict so that I wouldn\u0027t have to meet her eyes. In fact, we finished our breakfast mainly in silence, but after a while the silence became comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Met, she stood looking at Portrait of Beatrice de Clerval, 1879, the picture she\u0027d first encountered in a book Robert had left next to her sofa. \"You know, I think Robert came back here and found her again,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was watching her profile; it was the second time, I remembered sharply, that we\u0027d been in a museum together. \"He did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he traveled to New York at least once while he lived with me, as I wrote to you, and he came back strangely excited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary, do you want to go see Robert? I could take you when we get back to Washington. On Monday, if you\u0027d like.\" I hadn\u0027t meant to say it right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean that you want me to find out more for you by asking him myself?\" She stood straight and stiff, examining Beatrice\u0027s face one more time without looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shocked me. \"No, no--I wouldn\u0027t ask that of you. You\u0027ve already helped me see him in a new way. I only meant that I don\u0027t want to keep you from him if you need to see him yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned. Then she came closer, as if for protection, with Beatrice de Clerval watching us; in fact, she suddenly slipped one hand into mine. \"No,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to see him. Thank you.\" She took her hand away and walked around looking at the Degas ballerinas, and the nudes drying off with their big towels. After a few minutes she came back to me. \"Shall we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, it was a bright, soft summer day, warm rather than hot. I bought each of us a hot dog with mustard at one of the stands on the street. (\"How do you know I\u0027m not a vegetarian?\" said Mary, although we\u0027d already had two other meals together.) We wandered into Central Park and ate on a bench, cleaning our hands with paper napkins. Mary unexpectedly wiped the mustard off my hands as well as hers, and I thought what a lovely mother of young children she might have made, but naturally I didn\u0027t say it. I spread out my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hand looks much older than yours, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t it? It is somewhat older than mine. Twenty years, if you were born in 1947.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t ask how you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to, Sherlock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat watching her. The shade from oaks and beeches dappled her face and short-sleeved white blouse, the fine skin of her throat. \"How beautiful you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t say that,\" she said, looking down at her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant it only as a compliment, a respectful one. You\u0027re like a painting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s idiotic.\" She crumpled up the napkins and aimed them into a wastebasket next to our bench. \"No woman actually wants to be a painting.\" But when she turned back to me, our eyes met across the strange sound of what each of us had just said. She glanced away first. \"Have you ever been married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, a lot of medical school, and then I didn\u0027t meet the right person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed her legs in their jeans. \"Well, have you ever been in love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Several times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I considered. \"Maybe yes. Almost yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows until they disappeared under her short bangs. \"Make up your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to,\" I said as evenly as I could. It was like conversing with a wild deer, some animal that could start up and spring away. I stretched one arm across the back of the bench without touching her, and looked out into the park, the bends of gravel path, boulders, green hills under patrician trees, the people walking and biking along a nearby route. Her kiss caught me by surprise; at first I understood only that her face was very close. She was gentle, hesitating. I sat up slowly and put my hands on her temples and kissed her back, also gently, careful not to startle her further, my heart pounding. My old heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that in a minute she would draw away, then lean against me and begin to sob without making a sound, that I would hold her until she was finished, that we would soon part with a more passionate kiss for our separate journeys home, and that she would then say something like, I\u0027m sorry, Andrew -- I\u0027m not ready for this. But I had the long patience of my profession on my side, and I already understood certain things about her: she loved to go out to Virginia for the day to paint, as I did; she needed to eat often; she wanted to feel in control of her decisions. Madame, I said to her, but silently, I observe that your heart is broken. Allow me to repair it for you. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-79.html","bookId":2244,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:41 PM"}
