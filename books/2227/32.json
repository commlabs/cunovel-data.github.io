The bathrobe beside his bed bore the monogram HOTEL RITZ PARIS.He saw a dim light filtering through the blinds. Is it dusk ordawn? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s body felt warm and deeply contented. He had slept the better part of the last two days. Sitting up slowly in bed, he now realized what had awoken him... the strangest thought. For day she had been trying to sort through a barrage of information, but now Langdon found himself fixed on something he\u0027d not considered before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remained motionless a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting out of bed, he walked to the marble shower. Stepping inside, he let the powerful jets message his shoulders. Still, the thought enthralled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, Langdon stepped out of the Hotel Ritz into Place Vend\u0026amp;ocirc;me. Night was falling. The days of sleep had left him disoriented... and yet his mind felt oddly lucid. He had promised himself he would stop in the hotel lobby for a cafe au lait to clear his thoughts, but instead his legs carried him directly out the front door into the gathering Paris night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking east on Rue des Petits Champs, Langdon felt a growing excitement. He turned south onto Rue Richelieu, where the air grew sweet with the scent of blossoming jasmine from the stately gardens of the Palais Royal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued south until he saw what he was looking for - the famous royal arcade - a glistening expanse of polished black marble. Moving onto it, Langdon scanned the surface beneath his feet. Within seconds, he found what he knew was there - several bronze medallions embedded in the ground in a perfectly straight line. Each disk was five inches in diameter and embossed with the letters N and S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNord. Sud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned due south, letting his eye trace the extended line formed by the medallions. He began moving again, following the trail, watching the pavement as he walked. As he cut across the corner of the Comedie-Fran\u0026amp;ccedil;aise, another bronze medallion passed beneath his feet. Yes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets of Paris, Langdon had learned years ago, were adorned with 135 of these bronze markers, embedded in sidewalks, courtyards, and streets, on a north-south axis across the city. He had once followed the line from Sacre-Coeur, north across the Seine, and finally to the ancient Paris Observatory. There he discovered the significance of the sacred path it traced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earth\u0027s original prime meridian.The first zero longitude of the world.Paris\u0027s ancient Rose Line. Now, as Langdon hurried across Rue de Rivoli, he could feel his destination within reach. Less than a block away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Holy Grail \u0027neath ancient Roslin waits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe revelations were coming now in waves. Sauniere\u0027s ancient spelling of Roslin... the blade and chalice... the tomb adorned with masters\u0027 art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that why Sauniere needed to talk with me? Had I unknowingly guessed the truth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke into a jog, feeling the Rose Line beneath his feet, guiding him, pulling him toward his destination. As he entered the long tunnel of Passage Richelieu, the hairs on his neck began to bristle with anticipation. He knew that at the end of this tunnel stood the most mysterious of Parisian monuments - conceived and commissioned in the 1980s by the Sphinx himself, Fran\u0026amp;ccedil;ois Mitterrand, a man rumored to move in secret circles, a man whose final legacy to Paris was a place Langdon had visited only days before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a final surge of energy, Langdon burst from the passageway into the familiar courtyard and came to a stop. Breathless, he raised his eyes, slowly, disbelieving, to the glistening structure in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Louvre Pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGleaming in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe admired it only a moment. He was more interested in what lay to his right. Turning, he felt his feet again tracing the invisible path of the ancient Rose Line, carrying him across the courtyard to the Carrousel du Louvre - the enormous circle of grass surrounded by a perimeter of neatly trimmed hedges - once the site of Paris\u0027s primeval nature-worshipping festivals... joyous rites to celebrate fertility and the Goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt as if he were crossing into another world as he stepped over the bushes to the grassy area within. This hallowed ground was now marked by one of the city\u0027s most unusual monuments. There in the center, plunging into the earth like a crystal chasm, gaped the giant inverted pyramid of glass that he had seen a few nights ago when he entered the Louvre\u0027s subterranean entresol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa Pyramide Inversee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTremulous, Langdon walked to the edge and peered down into the Louvre\u0027s sprawling underground complex, aglow with amber light. His eye was trained not just on the massive inverted pyramid, but on what lay directly beneath it. There, on the floor of the chamber below, stood the tiniest of structures... a structure Langdon had mentioned in his manuscript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt himself awaken fully now to the thrill of unthinkable possibility. Raising his eyes again to the Louvre, he sensed the huge wings of the museum enveloping him... hallways that burgeoned with the world\u0027s finest art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDa Vinci... Botticelli...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdorned in masters\u0027 loving art, She lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlive with wonder, he stared once again downward through the glass at the tiny structure below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must go down there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping out of the circle, he hurried across the courtyard back toward the towering pyramid entrance of the Louvre. The day\u0027s last visitors were trickling out of the museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing through the revolving door, Langdon descended the curved staircase into the pyramid. He could feel the air grow cooler. When he reached the bottom, he entered the long tunnel that stretched beneath the Louvre\u0027s courtyard, back toward La Pyramide Inversee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the tunnel, he emerged into a large chamber. Directly before him, hanging down from above, gleamed the inverted pyramid - a breathtaking V-shaped contour of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chalice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s eyes traced its narrowing form downward to its tip, suspended only six feet above the floor. There, directly beneath it, stood the tiny structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA miniature pyramid. Only three feet tall. The only structure in this colossal complex that had been built on a small scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s manuscript, while discussing the Louvre\u0027s elaborate collection of goddess art, had made passing note of this modest pyramid. \"The miniature structure itself protrudes up through the flooras though it were the tip of an iceberg - the apex, of an enormous, pyramidical vault, submerged below like a hidden chamber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlluminated in the soft lights of the deserted entresol, the two pyramids pointed at one another, their bodies perfectly aligned, their tips almost touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chalice above. The Blade below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade and chalice guarding o\u0027er Her gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon heard Marie Chauvel\u0027s words. One day it will dawn on you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing beneath the ancient Rose Line, surrounded by the work of masters. What better place for Sauniere to keep watch? Now at last, he sensed he understood the true meaning of the Grand Master\u0027s verse. Raising his eyes to heaven, he gazed upward through the glass to a glorious, star-filled night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rests at last beneath the starry skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the murmurs of spirits in the darkness, forgotten words echoed. The quest for the Holy Grail is the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene. A journey to pray at the feet of the outcast one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sudden upwelling of reverence, Robert Langdon fell to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he thought he heard a woman\u0027s voice... the wisdom of the ages... whispering up from the chasms of the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-32.html","bookId":2227,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:49 PM"}
