We\u0027re doing all this work for nothing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get down!\" whispered Allison. \"Do you want to get us all in trouble?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron jumped on top of Allison\u0027s desk. \"Hi, Allison!\" he said. Then he hopped over to Deedee\u0027s desk, then Ron\u0027s, then Maurecia\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Please, Myron,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is fun!\" said Myron. He made a great leap and landed on top of the teacher\u0027s desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls had always kept a coffee can full of Tootsie Roll Pops on her desk. It was still there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, anyone want a Tootsie Roll Pop?\" asked Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone stared at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron took one for himself. He sat in the teacher\u0027s chair, with his feet up on the teacher\u0027s desk, and sucked on it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Please stop, Myron!\" begged Jenny. \"What if he\u0027s hiding in the closet?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get real!\" said Myron. \"Why would he hide in the closet?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What if Mr. Gorf was married to Mrs. Gorf?\" asked Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron laughed. \"Who would ever want to marry Mrs. Gorf?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Somebody had to marry her,\" said Rondi. \"Or else she wouldn\u0027t have been a Mrs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What if he loved her very much?\" asked Allison. \"And then one day she didn\u0027t come home from work. And he never saw her again. And he didn\u0027t know what happened to her. But he knew she used to teach this class! So he might be hiding in the closet to try to find out if we\u0027re the ones who got rid of her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I was married to Mrs. Gorf,\" said Jason, \"I\u0027d be glad she never came home. He should thank us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nice going, Jason!\" said Jenny. \"If he is hiding in the closet, you just told him we\u0027re the ones who got rid of his wife.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, if I didn\u0027t you just did,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It doesn\u0027t matter!\" shouted Myron. \"Because Mr. Gorf is not hiding in the closet!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron went to the back of the room and opened the closet door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A man stepped out. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I accidentally locked myself in here this morning, and I\u0027ve been waiting for someone to open the door.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron swallowed his Tootsie Roll Pop, stick and all.\n\u003cbr\u003e 59\n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name is Mr. Gorf,\" said the man who stepped out of the closet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And, surprising as it may seem, the children weren\u0027t afraid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was his voice. His voice was full of comfort and wisdom, like an old leather chair in a dusty library. It didn\u0027t matter what he said. It felt good just to listen to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was a handsome man, with neatly combed brown hair and clean fingernails. He carried a brown briefcase.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody even noticed that his nose had three\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e nostrils.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Since I am going to be your teacher for the next few months, let me tell you a bit about myself. I was born in the Himalayan Mountains in a town called Katmandu.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cat Man Do,\" said Terrence. \"Cool.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone laughed. They weren\u0027t laughing at Terrence. There was just something about the name of that city and the way Terrence said it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Terrence\u0027s voice was like a rusty drainpipe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you ever been married?\" asked Allison. Allison\u0027s voice was like a cat walking across a piano.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I\u0027m a bachelor,\" said Mr. Gorf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison smiled, greatly relieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s enough about me,\" said Mr. Gorf. \"How about some of you telling me about yourselves?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name is Mac,\" said Mac, without raising his hand. Mac\u0027s voice was like a freight train. \"I built the biggest snowman you ever saw. Man, it was huge. I had to stand on a ladder to put the hat on his head. It was a stovepipe hat, like Abraham Lincoln wore, but I don\u0027t know why they call it that. We have a microwave oven. Have you ever put a bag of marshmallows in a microwave oven?
