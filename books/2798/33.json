Once I’m sure the items are like new I place them back on display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLola and I chat. I ask her about Trick and what’s new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe responds, “I’m not sure what’s going on with Trick. Just when I think he’s going to make a move, he stops. And I’m there, you know? I want it to happen. But something’s holding him back. Not sure what more I can do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn thoughtful. Nik told me Trick moved back in with his Mom. He didn’t elaborate but I’m sure it has something to do with her. Maybe she’s sick? I don’t want to make assumptions to Lola and freak her out so I stroke her pretty brown hair and utter, “Be patient, honey. Trick isn’t a player. There must be a reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and replies sourly, “Hope he’s worth waiting for.” She looks at me and immediately softens. “Because I will, you know? I’ll wait.” She lowers her head and nods as if reassuring herself. “For Trick, I’ll wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeeze her shoulder and make my way towards the counter. Just as I get there I see an older man on the other side of the road. He’s clutching his chest and using his bowler hat to fan himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly Smokes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s going to faint!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run to the staff room, get a bottle of water from the fridge and snatch my stash of candy from counter before bolting out the door. I run into traffic using my hands to show cars I’m trying to help someone; luckily the cars stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the short, African American man just as he’s about to fall. I put my arms around him and slowly lower him to sit on his bottom against The White Rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly ask, “Are you okay?” I open the water and hand it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes it from me with shaking hands, drinks a little and replies breathily, “Oh, thank you, child. It seems the sun has it out for me today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart slows its pace and I plop down next to the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open up my stash of raspberry bullets and hold it out to him. He raises a brow but takes one and pops it into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the candy at the side of his mouth he says, “These are my favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudge his shoulder slightly and reply a little over excitedly, “Me, too!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonding with an old man over candy is nice. Don’t judge me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles but quickly firms his voice and reprimands, “You could’ve got hurt rushing over here, child. Best not be doing that again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and reply, “Sorry, I’d promise I won’t but if I saw someone going down the way you were, I probably would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out a hand to him and say, “I’m Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, his face looks stunned for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe covers it quickly, takes my hand and replies, “Jermaine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shake and smile at each other. Bonding over candy and water on a dirty sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how good friendships start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m just about to ask Jermaine to come to the store for coffee when I hear, “Uncle Jerm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax stands there staring wide eyed at the two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Crudsickles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sweet old man is big, bad Uncle Jerm of the Sixes? How can that be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face must show my unconcealed shock because when Uncle Jerm looks at me again he chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at Max and replies, “Was just coming to see my boy Nik. Felt a little dizzy when superwoman over here flew in and saved me.” He shuffled sideways and takes my hand in both of his. “You know, when people told me Nik’s woman was different, I didn’t get it. I thought a woman is a woman.” He kisses one of my hands and continues quietly, “Now I get it. You a special type of woman, Miss Tina. I’m glad to have met you. It was an honor and all my pleasure. Be sure of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat thickens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me. I don’t know how to respond. I just open and close my mouth like a fish out of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm smiles at me and hold his hands up to Max. He says, “Help an old man up, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax helps Uncle Jerm up and holds his arm with one hand. Then he holds out his other arm to me and I use it to pull myself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dust myself off and stutter “W- well, I better get back to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss Max on the cheek then do the same to Uncle Jerm. I know who he is but I feel we have a connection after today’s incident. I’m so happy when he takes my hand smiling and kisses it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I waltz back over to the store leaving Max smiling and shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttack of the She-Devil\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoker night has turned into board game night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out the guys were losing too much money to Ghost who has a supreme Poker face and no tell whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax, Ghost, and Lola sit at the dining table asking the others if anyone else wants to play. I see Nat raise her hand and walk over to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t even try to hide my worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to Max and speak softly, “Are you sure you want to play with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax looks confused and replies ,“Sure, T. We’re a player short.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my brows and respond a long, drawn out, “Ooookaaay.” Then I lean closer and whisper, “Don’t say I didn’t warn ya.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way over to the sofas with Uno. Meems hates playing this with me but is always a good sport and a tad competitive which is great because she doesn’t give in easily when I whoop her butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik, Trick, and Mimi gather around me as I deal. We all take our cards and play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik tries to cuddle me but I know he’s trying to look at my cards. I give him a don’t even think about it look that must look serious enough because he raises his brows, puts up his hands in surrender and backs away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit almost got serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe play three rounds. I win the first two and I’m actually happy when Meems wins the other. I jump off the sofa and tackle her to the ground saying, “You want a piece of me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m even happier when she bursts out laughing. Mimi seems a lot happier these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I jump off of her I hear Nat say loudly, “This game sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh poop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost smirks at her and responds, “No. You suck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, oh why, Ghost?! Don’t taunt the bull!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat stands and leans toward him over the table. I see her eye twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat can’t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers in eerie calm, “Oh yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost doesn’t even look at her when he replies a firm, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat picks up the board and throws it across the room. It hits the wall and bits and bobs fly everywhere. Then she stands and walks coolly to the sofa where she plops down and says sullenly, “I’m bored.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and look over to a shocked Max, a chuckling Ghost, and a pissed Lola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say sweetly, “I told you so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax nods his head and says, “Game over, Red Rover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look to the monitor but see Tina is already making her way to the kitchen for a glass of water for Ceecee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling to myself, I think about how perfect a mom she’d be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen suddenly I’m frowning. Because we won’t ever experience that together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax watches Tina with a small smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has been the perfect role model for Ceecee. She’s a successful business owner with good manners who loves to cook and involve Ceecee in everyday things. Her advice to Max about letting Ceecee be independent has really paid off, too. She gets herself ready for school, makes her own breakfast, and is generally happier. It was hard for Max to let go. He was so used to doing everything for Ceecee. Part of it being he liked being needed by her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he worried he would be left out of Ceecee’s life if he didn’t have to do anything for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina disappears down the hall and we all resume playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf hour passes and Tina hasn’t returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherlock Holmes time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI creep down the hall and find Max eavesdropping on Tina and Ceecee. He looks like he wants to laugh. I tap his shoulder. He turns and holds a finger to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Tina first. “The thing about makeup is that less is more. You put on a ton of makeup and you’ll end up looking like a clown!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee doesn’t speak for a long moment then responds with, “But I like clowns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina’s voice sounds wistful as she says, “Yeah, me too.” Then she excitedly offers, “Ooh! Next time the circus is in town we’ll go!” I can practically hear her bouncing up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s my goofball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee whisper replies, “You’re the coolest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina responds matter-of-factly, “Nuh uh. You’re the coolest. Ice cold, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee sounds full of awe when she asks, “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina replies, “Uh, yeah!” She makes it sound like Duh! “You think I come here to see your uncle or your daddy? Nope. I come here to see your pretty face, angel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them says anything for a while then Ceecee whispers, “Love you, Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina responds with a choked, “Love you more, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn sideways to look at Max. He looks to be in pain. His eyes are bright and he swallows hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns and creeps back down the hall without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee is finally asleep and I tiptoe down the hall back to the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the games have stopped and everyone has taken their usual places on the sofas watching yet another Will Ferrell movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone except Max, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over to Nik and shoot him a questioning look. He nods his head toward the patio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step out to the patio to find Max with both hands on the rail, head slumped down between his shoulders. I touch his arm and ask quietly, “Honey, you wanna tell me what’s bothering you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replies a short and firm, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing my hand to lightly tousle his hair I say, “Okay, honey. But I’m here with open ears if you need ‘em.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m halfway back to the door when I hear a pained, “You got no idea, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk back over to him, touch his arm and tell him, “So help me understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax swallows hard and says quietly, “You got no idea what it’s like to love someone so much, with all ya freakin’ heart, but she looks exactly like someone you hate. It feels like a cruel reminder every time I look at her I see the face of the person who put her in that fuckin’ chair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadness eats away at what’s left of my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. This is the most Max has ever spoken to me about Ceecee and her accident. Nik has since told me the story just so I’d have all the facts and not be completely ignorant about Ceecee’s mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel honored that Max would let me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Max doesn’t know is that I know a bit about how he feels. Mia looked just like Jace and every day was a reminder of the heartbreak I felt. But then Mia would smile or giggle and I’d also be reminded that Jace was a big fat stupid head to leave that behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping my arms around his waist, I squeeze and rest my forehead on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stay like this a long time before I break away and give him some time alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I reach the door I look back to my damaged friend and pray that someday he’ll find love again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday night comes and all us girls are itching to get to the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need drinks and laughter, stat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are over people trying to bring us down and Mimi told me that if I had any more problems with anyone this week to flip em the bird and say some really nasty words which made me giggle and blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re all dressed in our usual attire and head to The White Rabbit or, Wonderland as we like to call it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipation drives us crazy. As soon as we exit the cab we bound up to B-Rock whooping and jumping around like loons. He chuckles, holds his cheek out to accept our kisses and lets us in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s bangin’ tonight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make our way up the stairs to the VIP area and Asian Alice is there to greet us with a smile and escort us to our booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick and Max are already seated, talking and laughing together. As soon as they notice us approach they both stand to hug and greet us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask where Nik is and Max shrugs and tells me he was called to his office to deal with an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should go over there and make his emergency a little more fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk internally and decide I’ll do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first, I need a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder how the fuck I’m standing in my office with Sissy when I should be out waiting on Tina to get to the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not the emergency I had in mind when I was called to my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy is dressed in a white thigh high dress. It’s a miracle it covers her pussy and I suddenly wonder what I ever saw in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah. That’s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in my office chair and Sissy sits very close to me on the edge of the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask, “What can I do for you, Sissy? You know, it’s funny, but I thought you were banned from the club.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe throws me a sour look and replies, “Don’t be mean, Nik.” She smiles what I used to think was a sexy smile and says, “I just wanted to see how you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a fuckin’ emergency?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop myself from rubbing my hands down my face and reply, “I’m busy. And speaking of busy, I need to get back so please escort yourself out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move to stand but she stops me with a foot on my thigh. She scoots closer to me and my eyes narrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s up to something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning quick, she slips off the desk and into my lap, lowers her face to mine and kisses me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a nice kiss either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s sloppy and her tongue prods at my lips. Revulsion washes over me. Her hands remove my shirt tails out of my slacks. I stand. She falls to the floor on her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m fuming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spit, “I had one fuckin’ rule, Sissy. Don’t ever kiss me. My kisses go to special people. Not people I used to fuck.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-33.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
