It didn’t matter where they went, how formal the occasion, or how out of place her “badass fairy” dresses were, he always looked at her like she was the most beautiful woman in the room. She looked around at her friends, who were all laughing and squabbling happily, and her brothers—Billy and Chase—who were lightheartedly mediating a fight that had broken out amongst the small children on the sidelines, and felt remarkably blessed. This place, these people, and this moment right now—it was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did we get so lucky?” she asked Gabe, who stood behind her and wrapped his arms around her front until his hands rested on her belly. He rested his chin on her shoulder as he watched their happy group of family and friends too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know . . . but I know my luck started improving one night long ago, when a sexy, drunken fairy wiped me out with an unexpected kiss. It was the best damned thing that ever happened to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you so much,” she said, craning her head to look back at him, and she just managed to see the corner of his lip kick up in a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t possibly be as much as I love you,” he teased. She turned within his hold and wrapped her arms around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna bet?” she challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll lose,” he retorted. Before she could say another word he kissed her, and the caress was sweet, hot, loving, and perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think,” she whispered when he lifted his head, “that we’re both winners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and released her briefly before taking hold of her hand and leading her home.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/his-unlikely-lover-unwanted-3/page-84.html","bookId":1836,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:34 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:34 AM"}
