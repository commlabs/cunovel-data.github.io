In the darkness of the forest, the woman\u0027s face and hands shone with a whispery glow, barely noticeable, but there.

Here must be the source of the story. He also remembered another story of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe craned up toward the jagged cliffs, framed against the dark sky.

He had no choice. There was nothing he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a break in the foliage, he stared back toward the black water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirates\u0027 boat had slowed near the beach. Rifles bristled toward shore, searching. But Rakao stood braced in the bow, a dark silhouette with long spear in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a heave, the Maori hunter drove the length of steel into the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcs of blue lightning sizzled outward from where it struck, brilliant in the darkness, lighting up the night and the depths of the lagoon.

A painful shock clenched through her.

She was too weak to fight, too tired to care. Sodden to bone, bleeding from a score of lacerations, she awaited her fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao was in midargument with Devesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Malay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond her comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lisa suspected the fight was about the tattooed pirate not pursuing Susan Tunis into the jungle. Lisa understood only one word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKanibals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the men a robed Surina stood at the entrance to the boat, out of the rain, arms folded, back straight, patient. Her eyes were fixed on Lisa. Not cold—that implied some emotion. Surina\u0027s eyes were a total void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Devesh turned and pointed an arm at Lisa. He spoke in English as a courtesy to their captive. \"Shoot her. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa straightened in the pirate\u0027s arms. She coughed her voice to a hoarse mumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered the Guild scientist the only thing she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo save her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devesh,\" she said firmly. \"The Judas Strain.

Istanbul\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock slowed the scene down to a breathless, silent stretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a second-story window of Hagia Sophia, Gray watched the back of Balthazar Pinosso\u0027s head explode in a spray of blood and bone. His body crumpled at the waist from the impact. His arms went wide to the side. His cell phone, at his ear a moment before, went flying from his fingertips, struck the pavement, and skittered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large man\u0027s body struck next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor gasped at Gray\u0027s side, breaking the tableau. \"Oh, my Lord... no...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSound crashed back: the echo of the gunshot, screams from the plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray drew back, taking an extra breath to realize the implication. If Balthazar was shot. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nasser knew about him,\" Vigor said, finishing his own slow thought. Stunned, the monsignor caught himself on the ledge of the window. \"Nasser knew Balthazar was here. The monster\u0027s snipers killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray fared no better, dazed with incomprehension and guilt. He had sent the man out to a firing squad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams and shouts grew worse outside, spreading inside. People ran—most fleeing to the nearest shelter, the sanctuary of Hagia Sophia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes ago, Gray and Vigor had climbed to the church\u0027s second floor, where there was less traffic, keeping hidden. Before heading out, Balthazar had informed the museum curator that Gray and Vigor had already left, denying the need for an ambulance. They had come up here to make sure all went well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police will swarm here,\" Gray said. \"We\u0027ve got to hide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor grabbed Gray\u0027s sleeve. \"Your mother and father. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. He had no time to consider that. Nasser had warned against any ruse. But once voiced aloud, Gray could not escape the terror. His breathing grew heavier; he became light-headed. Gray\u0027s parents would also suffer for this mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had Nasser known about Balthazar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor continued to stare out the window. The monsignor\u0027s fingers tightened on Gray\u0027s arms. \"Dear Lord . . . what\u0027s she doing now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned his full attention back to the open plaza below the western facade. As people fled the square or crouched in fear, only one figure ran straight through all the confusion. She limped slightly, favoring her left side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was she coming here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost to the church, a chatter of sparks struck at her heels. Someone was shooting at her. Nasser\u0027s men. But her sudden appearance had caught the snipers off guard. With orders to keep Gray and his companions from leaving the church, they hadn\u0027t been expecting someone running toward the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiechan sped faster, racing death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1:58 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlindsided, Seichan cursed. So Nasser did have a sniper or two positioned out here. She had missed picking them out earlier. Then again, the snipers had plenty of time to hide well. Seichan had not anticipated a traitor among their group. Balthazar had already been at Hagia Sophia all morning, setting up a snug snare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dashed through the Imperial Doors and ducked against the inside wall. Were gunmen in here, too? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-46.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
