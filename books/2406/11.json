But I’m willing to bet he conveniently forgot to mention the G-word when you met his mother. What about his dad?” Gabrielle added. “And Little Miss Redhead? What’s her name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Natalie,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Gabrielle huffed. “I’m sure he was all lovey-dovey in front of her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat said nothing, and her cousin talked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just saying, if you’re sneaking around behind his back because you think something’s wrong, fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I think something’s wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle sidled closer. “But if you’re doing it because you want something to be wrong…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean the owner of Hale Industries might not be able to go to Rome to steal a Rembrandt on a whim. I mean, maybe a guy who is concerned with stock prices might forget to care about long cons.” Gabrielle sidled even closer, hand on hip. “What I mean, dear cousin, is that maybe you want Hale to get out of his family’s business because that is the only way to keep him in yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more than a little embarrassing how much time Kat spent wishing her cousin were wrong but knowing in her heart she wasn’t. It wasn’t fair that Gabrielle could be both so beautiful and so wise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get some sleep, Kitty Kat.” Gabrielle started up the stairs. “You’re spending tomorrow night at the museum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news, Kat couldn’t help but think, was that the Petrovich exhibit was far from the most impressive thing among the Henley’s always impressive collection. Sitting as it was, in the center of the grand promenade, it was easy for the guards and the docents and even the visitors themselves to overlook it, to treat the dozen prominent pieces less like valuable works of art and more like…well…furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesks and bookcases and even chests of drawers filled the center of the corridor with only red velvet ropes standing between the precious works and the sticky hands of sweaty tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowds were heavy and the winds outside were brisk, so even Kat had to concede that the conditions were as perfect as they could be, given the circumstances. But the circumstances, any decent thief would know, were far from good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still the Henley, and Kat and her crew were still the kids who’d robbed it, and so it was with more than a little trepidation that she followed Gabrielle (who had been forced to abandon her short skirts and tall heels for the occasion, lest any of the guards recollected seeing her legs on that fateful day last December).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past was the past, and the people at the Henley seemed to go about their business as if nothing at all had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat, on the other hand, knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards were on a different rotation. The cameras had been upgraded no more than a month before. The security system was running on an entirely different feed, and this time Kat could see Simon out of the corner of her eye, lingering by the doors to the North Garden. His hands were shaking as he paced back and forth, looking like he was going to burst through the doors and run screaming from the Henley at any moment. But he didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like this. I feel naked. I feel…blind,” Simon said through the comms unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then push your wig back,” Gabrielle told him from her place by the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn’t the problem, and Kat knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no fair,” Simon said. “They get to have computers. And cameras. With facial-recognition software. Have I mentioned I am not a fan of facial-recognition software?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Gabrielle told him. “You might have mentioned it when you were shopping for fake noses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon defended his honor. Gabrielle insulted his nose. But the words were just a distant humming in Kat’s ears as she walked down the long main corridor filled with desks and cabinets, a bookcase from the library of a very famous university that had been transplanted there piece by piece, including the very secret compartment behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat moved slowly, taking it all in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she saw it—the desk in the middle of the exhibit—twenty yards from the entrance to the Imperial China room, directly opposite the portrait of Veronica Henley herself. Kat thought of another fine old lady as she inched closer to the velvet ropes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t the most ornate of the pieces, but it was Kat’s favorite—the very one she would have chosen if she could have picked any Petrovich for herself. The drawers were intricately carved. The pass-through underneath had a swinging door. The top was soft leather with small brass studs. It was masculine, Kat thought; not the place for an old woman’s thank-you notes and diaries. No. It was a desk made for business, and Kat imagined Hazel there, filling her husband’s seat quite literally as she carried both the family and the company into a new era.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still wish I had a computer,” Simon said from his place by the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat pulled her thoughts and her gaze away from Hazel’s desk and studied the long corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t need a computer, Simon,” Kat said. “We just need them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo any casual observer, she was probably pointing at the herd of schoolchildren that was walking down the promenade and toward the main doors. It was easy to miss Nick, who lingered at the far end of the hall, and the Bagshaws, who were walking in her direction, a tall, steaming cup of coffee in Angus’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attention Henley guests,” a woman’s voice announced over the loudspeakers, “we have reached our close of business. Please make your way to the doors, and remember, the museum will open again at nine a.m. tomorrow morning. Thank you for visiting the Henley, and have a lovely evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe schoolchildren walked a little faster. The docents gestured the crowd toward the doors. And, quietly, Kat said, “Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the management of the Henley would never say so aloud, no one was really certain what had happened that afternoon. Of the two dozen school groups that had been scheduled to visit, not a single teacher seemed to know where the children got the items they eventually carried through the Henley’s halls. A staffer had handed them out, somebody said. It was some kind of free promotion gone wrong, others assumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth remained that of the hundred children who walked through the Henley at the close of business on that particular day, approximately half of them were carrying helium-filled balloons in a variety of colors. The other half had small whirligigs, the kind depicted in a sculpture by a new Swiss artist of much acclaim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd absolutely no one knew exactly how or why the doors at either end of the long hallway opened at the same time, sending a massive gush of wind rushing through the Henley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small toys began to spin. Wild splashes of color and flashes of light filled the corridor. Balloons flew free of their owners’ hands, blinding the cameras and popping against the hot lights overhead. The noise must have been in the same frequency as breaking glass, because the sensors in the control room went haywire. And even the Henley guards, with their highly expert surveillance videos, could see nothing beyond the glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t even notice when a very tall, very hot cup of coffee went flying over the velvet ropes and landed on the leather-covered desktop that had once belonged to the Hale family’s London estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the chaos finally ended, all that remained were broken balloons and a stained desk, and the security experts who agreed that things could have been far, far worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkmen appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDollies were ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one noticed that the desk was heavier than it had been when they’d moved it onto the exhibit floor only a few days before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey never even looked in the small pass-through compartment, where Katarina Bishop hid, clinging for dear life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was beginning to think that Simon was right: it was absolutely no fun being blind. But true to her name, her eyes adjusted to the black as she stayed perfectly still in her hiding spot beneath the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Nick and his blueprints were accurate, there was one room where there were no cameras. In the center of the basement, with no exterior access of any kind, there was one place where no guards would ever have to patrol. So Kat stayed hidden, and when the desk stopped moving, she listened as the sound of work boots on concrete faded in the distance. And once certain she was alone, she dropped to the floor, rolled out from under the desk, and surveyed the dim and empty room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were tall shelves with jars of varnish and paint in every shade, long tables lined with tools and brushes. It was a place where meticulous people did meticulous work, and part of Kat couldn’t help being impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped around the room, studying the works in progress. There was a pair of portraits by Matisse, a sculpture by Rodin. The piece of DNA she shared with Uncle Eddie tugged at her, and her mind flashed with exit strategies and all the ways that one might carry a twelve-hundred-pound Greek relic out of the fifth-most secure building in Britain. But then the beam of her favorite flashlight shone across the ornate desk, and Kat knew what she had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, without the velvet rope, Kat was free to feel the intricate carvings. She ran her fingers over acorns and trees, bows and arrows. Kat examined every inch. It was exquisite. But there was one part that seemed wrong. On each of the desk’s four corners there were markings, like needles of a compass, and one of them pointed in the wrong direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, hello there,” Kat said. “What do you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Kat turned the arrow, she heard the tiniest of clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got it,” she whispered. “Did I get it?” she asked, then looked to see a narrow piece of the baseboard that had popped free from the rest of the desk. She sank to her knees and shined her light inside, stuck a hand into the dusty space until she felt a single piece of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wait. It wasn’t paper. Not really. Kat held it against the light. It was carbon paper, black with faint white letters—the kind offices used to make duplicates of important documents in the days before computers and even copy machines. The carbon had probably been in the desk for years. And it was only one page—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not here,” Kat said, defeated. She crumbled the carbon and put it into her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, Kat.” Simon’s voice was in her ear. “Petrovich didn’t put just one compartment in his pieces. There would be two or three at least. Keep on looking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Kat,” Nick said. “You have all the time you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Kat went back to work. She opened drawers and felt inside shelves. She ran her delicate fingers beneath the lip of the desktop and along all four legs. There was a nick on the top right-hand corner, but it was just a flaw, Kat realized—not a clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had all night, Kat had to remind herself. Come morning, she could slip outside and into the crowds that filled the Henley. All she had to do was think and feel and see. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-11.html","bookId":2406,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM"}
