No! God, no!” When I reached for her arm, she recoiled away from me. “His first wife,” I said. “The one who overdosed and died. Julian’s real mother. She came into the bar one night and I had no idea who she was. But Pick assured me it was okay, he and she never had that kind of relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he was still technically married to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t get my hands to stop shaking or my breathing to settle down. I hated seeing her like this. “Yes,” I rasped. “He was still technically married to her...in name only.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed her eyes closed. “What about the rest of our friends? You’ve never slept with any of the women in our group, have you? Reese?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I whispered. “I have never slept with Buttercup or any of our friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline sniffed and wiped at her damn cheeks. I went to move toward her, but she held up a hand. “I just...need a second here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my hand and blew out a breath, but my ribs felt as if they wanted to cave in on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s...” She sopped more tears off her cheeks with her fingers. “What’s something Noel would think to tell me? Something he’d think is...bad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” I groaned and scrubbed my face, just wanting this to be over. “Our freshman year, I guess. We’d go to parties, get wasted and bring a girl back to our dorm room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A girl,” Caroline repeated slowly. “A—singular—girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Yeah. Just...some girl, a different one each time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then...” She shook her head, confused. “What?” But a split second later, she caught on. Her eyes flared. “Oh my fucking God. You had threesomes...with my brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I mean, not...really. We just...took turns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eww.” She gagged and slapped her hand over her mouth. The tears fell harder, and I cursed a little louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then there was Faith McCrown.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what? No.” Caroline lifted her hands in surrender and flew off my bed. “I don’t...I don’t think I want to hear anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Caroline.” I scrambled after her, but she warded me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Please. Don’t touch me right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it.” I fisted my hands, wanting to hit something or grab on to her and hold on for dear life. “I knew this was a bad idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it wasn’t. I just...I need some time.” She snatched her jeans off the floor and jerked them on under my too-big-for-her T-shirt. “I gotta go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched helplessly as she slammed her feet into her shoes. “You don’t have to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blurted out a miserable laugh and sent me a dark look. “No, I really do.” When she stood, I opened my mouth to say...fuck, I had nothing to say to defend myself. I’d been a slutty man-whore, and that’s all there was to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter pushing her fingers across her damp face one more time, she hugged her arms over her chest and cast me a broken glance. “Bye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried from the room, and like the complete screw-up idiot I was, I just let her go. Then I slumped onto my bed and whispered, “Bye,” as I cradled my head in my hands and tried not to lose my fucking mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix days passed. I gave Caroline her space...and she fucking took it. She didn’t call, she didn’t Facebook message, she didn’t come over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI died a little inside every hour she stayed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out to her exactly three times. The next morning, I texted, saying, I’m sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day after that, I added, I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on day three, I wrote, I still trust you. I trusted her to learn all this shit about me and not break my heart by leaving me. But my fucking trust had been sorely tested, and shredded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reminded myself, she just needed time. She’d get over this, and she’d come back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I repeated that over and over in my head, not really believing any of it, while I clung to the hope of it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline fucking hated me now, and she was done with me. My life was fucking over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t even show up at Forbidden the next Friday to watch Hart’s band, and she always came to cheer on Non-Castrato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the bar closed, I was putting away the last bottle of liquor, when I just stopped and stared at it, tempted to drown all my sorrows like a typical brokenhearted douche. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-143.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
