Xoxox\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that face?” Butch asks pulling my eyes from the text. The disappointment must be showing on my face. Maybe a night alone isn’t so bad. I could go to that cute lingerie place in town and get a few things. I own, like, two cute pairs of underwear, and I’ve already worn them both twice. I want something different and fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Law just canceled on me.” I try to make my voice flat, like it’s no big deal, but Butch puts his arm around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come have a few beers with Paine and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s better than sitting at home. “Sure. I just need to run home and change before I make a quick stop. Meet you guys there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good. You can help me poke bossman about the blonde piece of ass he was drooling all over today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort, remembering how Paine looked when the woman walked into the shop. I thought he might trip over his own feet to get to her. It was worse when she seemed to give him the slip. Now he’s been back in his office pouting about it for the last twenty minutes. I didn’t even know Paine could pout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you guys there.” I head to my locker, grab my shit, and head home. I rush through a shower, and it only takes me thirty minutes to be back in town. I threw on some jeans and a simple black tee with my boots. It’s not like I’m trying to impress tonight. I have a man. The simple thought makes me blush and giddy with excitement. I have a man. I say it over and over again in my head, loving it more every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding to drop my car in the bar parking lot, I walk towards Main Street in the direction of the lingerie shop. It’s a small town, and if you park anywhere by the main road, you can pretty much walk anywhere. Walking by the different shops and stores, I stop suddenly when a familiar face catches my attention. The sudden glance makes my stomach drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, in the little Italian restaurant, I see the Mayor and his wife, with Law, and a leggy blonde who I’ve never seen before. They’re all sitting at a table together, and Law is holding the blonde’s hand. Like he feels my eyes on him, he turns to look at me, but I sidestep the glass window and lean against the brick building, trying to get my pounding heart under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFucking work shit, my ass. Jesus, could Butch have been more right? Suddenly, I feel like his dirty little secret. Law never takes me out to dinner, nor does he even talk about his family. If it wasn’t for the fact that it’s common knowledge that he’s the Mayor’s son, I would’ve never known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt burns. Holy shit, does it fucking burn. I push the tears back and shake off the hurt, going with anger instead. I was about to go get lingerie for his ass and set up something sexy. I was going to call him out on taking shit from my house and putting it in his. Tell him he didn’t have to play games, that I wanted to be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid. Stupid. Stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should’ve known better. I see how my brothers burn through beautiful women. Hell, I live with Butch, and I see how he burns through them. I’m a tomboy and a plain Jane at best. How did I expect to keep someone like Law?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone buzzes in my back pocket, and I see I have two texts. One from Butch and one from Law. Is he texting me while he’s on a date? A date he took to meet his father? I grit my teeth and click on Butch’s text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButch: See your car in the bar parking lot. Where you at?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Be there in five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross the street, not wanting to walk right in front of the restaurant again, then head towards the bar. I can’t stop myself from clicking to see what Law said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaw: Miss you, sweets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutch the phone to keep myself from throwing it. Sweets. I loved that name. How he always said I smell so sweet, taste so sweet, am so sweet. No one had ever called me sweet before him, and I was eating it up. It was like he saw the real me. Yeah, I like to fix cars and watch football and dress down a lot, but I’m a woman, and when he called me sweet, it made me feel like one. Stupid, I snap at myself again. He played you. Got what we wanted. Sex. Some piece of ass on the side to fuck when he wanted, and no one had to know about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look fit to be tied.” I look up to see Butch and Paine waiting for me outside the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t want to fucking talk about it.” My voice is firm but holds a little more emotion in it than I like, but they both just nod, getting it. That’s the great thing about having male friends. They don’t make you talk things to death. You say, “Conversation over,” and it wraps up pretty quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButch and I follow Paine in, and I can tell Paine is in just as much of a pissy mood as I am. The only one who looks like someone hasn’t kicked their puppy is Butch, but he’s always got a stupid easy smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout asking, Jake the bartender slides us our drinks, and I quickly grab my beer, thinking I’m going to need something stronger tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a bachelorette party happening here tonight if you guys are looking for some action,” Jake says, making me roll my eyes as I take my seat next to Paine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Point me in the right direction, Jake. You know I’m always looking for some fresh trim in this town.” Butch straightens and gives the crowd a once-over as Jake points towards the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot being able to help myself, I follow Jake’s finger to see who Butch’s prey for the night will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Butch is laughing and looking back, and I see why when I catch the blonde hair of the woman who ran out of the shop today with Paine hot on her ass. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mechanic-breeding-2/page-35.html","bookId":1799,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM"}
