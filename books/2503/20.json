It is unfortunate that I should at this time be detained by pressing legal matters which demand an expeditious response. I ask that you excuse me, and I trust that you will understand my predicament and not judge me too harshly for circumstances that are beyond my control. I am confident you will receive her respectfully for her children\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour daughter-in-law has with her not only the coachman, but her maid and an escort of two armed men whose purpose it is to protect her from any harm that may threaten her. They will all bring her to Ravensberg, where I will once again meet her at the conclusion of her visit with you. She is carrying a small box of uncut gems that are my present to you, as well as a pair of etchings from the last century showing two perspectives of Salzburg, which is her gift to her children. She herself brings a case of brandy for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope that this finds you well; may this year bring you good health, good harvests, the good-will of our neighbors, and contentment for all who dwell under your roof,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost sincerely,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaint-Germain Ragoczy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComte Franciscus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(his sigil, the eclipse) \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20/page-20.html","bookId":2503,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:05 PM"}
