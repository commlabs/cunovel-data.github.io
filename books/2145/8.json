It was like me to snoop, so I took advantage of my true nature. Of course, Becky was horrified with the whole idea and decided to wait in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do so well on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can cover more terrain with two people. I want to know what they might have come here for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that spying? Maybe Alexander\u0027s father was getting a haircut. Why would that be such a big deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t be if they weren\u0027t vampires,I wanted to say. \"Nothing about them is usual\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky put the truck in park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I\u0027ll go myself. But leave the truck running in case I need a quick getaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" she said, hopping out of the truck. \"I\u0027d better keep my eye on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Works every time,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emerson building was like any other upscale office center. The blue and white glass structure was box-shaped. A three-tiered fountain highlighted the center of the building, and itsMasonite floors sparkled as if they\u0027d just been waxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky appeared to be intimidated by what she thought was a security guard ready to arrest all teen loiterers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an info desk,\" I said. \"Chill out\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way to the elevators and scanned the alphabetized list of tenants hanging on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we have to see which one they went into,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you just wanted to know what was in the building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored Becky\u0027s comment. \"They visited at night, so that should eliminate some of these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged Becky into the male-only hair salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We only do men\u0027s hair,\" theoverdyed red-haired receptionist said before I asked her a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Did a couple come in last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A male couple?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, a man and a woman.They\u0027re fromRomania .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thanks for your help,\" I said.\"One down, five hundred to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe opened the glass doors to a Younger You cosmetic surgery office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember seeing a couple here yesterday?\" I asked the receptionist, who could have doubled as a nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our client list is confidential\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Iunderstand you can\u0027t tell me who visited your office, but you surely can tell me who didn\u0027t. So can you confirm that a man and woman fromRomaniadidn\u0027t visit this office yesterday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky was getting fed up. Not with the office workers - but with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about I wait here?\" she asked, pointing to the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just stay with me. I won\u0027t appear to be such a crackpot you\u0027re by my side,\" I begged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got in the elevator and made our way floor by floor, office by office. \"Did a couple come in here last evening dressed like me?\" I\u0027d ask, and each receptionist would gawk at me and respond similarly, \"No. I think I\u0027d remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last office was Berkley Realtors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tired. Please, let\u0027s go home\" Becky pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we only have one more togo \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving,\" Becky said, exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet hurt, too. And who knew, maybe one of these receptionists we spoke with wasn\u0027t working yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said, guiding my weary friend into the elevator. \"Enough parent hunting for today...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow,\" Becky said as the elevator doors closed, \"you can take the bus.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-8.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
