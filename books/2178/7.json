When he appears, I see why he was so long-he stopped to pick flowers and weave a necklace out of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turnips!\" he shouts happily, waving the necklace at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a big group cheer and we surround him, laughing, hugging, exclaiming at the same time-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was amazing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen anything like it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be a son of the gods!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The demons thought they had us dead but they didn\u0027t count on Run Fast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun Fast smiles hazily, unsure of what all the fuss is about. In his head, I don\u0027t think leading demons a merry chase counts for much. He\u0027s far prouder of the necklace of flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re through congratulating Run Fast we set off again, anxious to cover as much ground as we can before nightfall. It\u0027s a showery day and we\u0027re soon soaked. But that\u0027s a minor inconvenience. We\u0027ll take any amount of soakings after our unexpected escape from the demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly afternoon. I\u0027ve been discussing the ring of stones with Fiachna, wondering how old it was, who built it, what its original purpose might have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pity they didn\u0027t have ogham stones back then,\" Fiachna says. \"They could have told us who they were and lived on through their writing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you read ogham?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit. I learnt it from a bard who couldn\u0027t pay me for my work. Can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Banba didn\u0027t like ogham. She said magic shouldn\u0027t be recorded, that history should be kept alive by word of mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Fiachna says. \"But many stories are lost forever that way. I think...\" He stops, eyes narrowing. \"Connla!\" he calls-the young would-be king has been leading for the last couple of hours. When Connla looks back, Fiachna points to a spot off to the right. \"A large, strange hut. I think it\u0027s a church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone gathers around us. I can see the tip of the building now that Fiachna\u0027s pointed it out. It\u0027s not like any I\u0027ve seen before but I\u0027ve heard of its type. A Christian church. I didn\u0027t know they\u0027d built any this close to our tuath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe advance on the church. My insides are tight. It\u0027s a feeling I always get when I hear of the upstart religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristians are new to our land, but already it\u0027s hard to imagine a time when they weren\u0027t here. They\u0027ve spread as fast as rabbits, bringing their churches and unnatural ways into tuath after tuath, converting everyone they encounter. I\u0027ve never met a Christian but from what I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re powerful and persuasive, with no tolerance for other ways of thinking. They believe all people should follow their faith, that no gods are real except their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threat of Christians was a major worry for us before the Fomorii came. Even though we were far removed from any of the infected tuatha, we knew we couldn\u0027t hope to avoid them forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what we heard, they\u0027d converted all of the north and east. It was only a matter of time before their priests came-maybe their high priest, Padraig, would come himself-and then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould they convert us too? Would Conn grant them his backing, as so many other kings had, and order us to follow their ways, abandon our gods, adopt their customs? It didn\u0027t seem possible. Our religion is old. Our gods are sacred, as real to us as our ancestors. We lead our lives based on ancient, just laws, handed down from father to son, mother to daughter. How could we turn away from all that within a matter of days and become another people entirely?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d have said it was impossible, except I knew from the reports that it isn\u0027t. While the Christians don\u0027t have our understanding and control of magic, they have strange powers of their own. They\u0027ve come from far across the world, winning over most of those they met along the way. Common sense suggested we\u0027d be no different, no more immune to their persuasive spells than any other clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe thought Christianity was the worst disaster that could befall us. Then the demons attacked and we realised there were far greater enemies in the world than the followers of the god they call Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreeping up to the door of the church. I sense power within. A dark, throbbing, painful power. It gives me a headache. This church doesn\u0027t have the natural feel of our own holy places. It\u0027s a building of power but not magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stop at the door of the church, unwilling to enter in case demons are inside. I thought a church would be protected from the Fomorii, like the ring of stones. But as powerful as they are, Christians lack the skills of the Old Creatures, because it\u0027s obvious this church has been attacked and demons have been at play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can see the mess through the open door. Blood everywhere. Bits of human bodies. A man\u0027s head-maybe a priest\u0027s-stuck on the tip of a spear set in the centre of the church. Eyelids ripped off, eyes gouged out, demonic symbols scrawled in blood across his forehead and cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen demons do this,\" Goll says, scratching the flesh over his own lost eye. \"They usually strike and kill, make off with the bodies they want, leave the others just scattered around. This is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like what we do with our enemies after a battle,\" Fiachna agrees. \"If you add this to the trap they built around the ring of stones, there\u0027s only one conclusion. Tiernan was right-they\u0027re becoming more intelligent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel sick when Fiachna says that. If the demons start plotting, scheming and fighting like humans, with their extra strength and powers they\u0027re certain to crush us all within months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stand in the doorway a few moments more, studying the face of the dead man. Then we retreat, spirits dampened, and continue on our trek to Run Fast\u0027s home, wondering if we\u0027ll find similar scenes of chaos there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate in the evening. Worrying about the night ahead and where we\u0027ll stop. It\u0027s too much to hope to find another ring of magical stones. We\u0027re tired from the march and lack of sleep. If we don\u0027t find shelter soon, we\u0027re in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, without warning, Run Fast darts ahead of us. He stops, looks back and beckons hastily. \"Bumpy frogs!\" he shouts. \"Run fast!\" Then he tears ahead, disappearing through the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like our journey\u0027s at an end,\" Connla smiles. \"I thought we\u0027d have a much further march than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gods must be looking down on us,\" Goll grunts, then catches Connla\u0027s arm as he goes to follow Run Fast. \"Careful. Don\u0027t forget why we\u0027re here. These people are in trouble. There\u0027s no telling what we\u0027ll find. The demons might have them surrounded, like at the ring of stones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnla hesitates, then takes a step back. \"What do you suggest? Go in together or send a scout first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Together,\" Goll says after a second of thought. \"To separate is to weaken. But everybody draw your weapons and tread carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re all prepared, we advance cautiously, scanning the branches of the trees overhead and roots at our feet-sometimes worm-like demons disguise themselves as roots and snag unsuspecting passers-by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of minutes later we come to a clearing and find ourselves at the edge of a lake. A crannog has been built on an island in the middle of the water. A small, fenced fort, containing half a dozen huts. There\u0027s a sentry post built above the gate, and from the marks beneath it and here on the shore, I think there was once a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. But that\u0027s been demolished, probably because of the threat posed by demons. Now you can only get to it by swimming or in one of the curraghs tied up close to the fort\u0027s gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello!\" Goll yells. Echoes, then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun Fast is hopping up and down, his face alight, reaching out to the crannog as though he can stretch across the lake and stroke the walls of the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anybody there?\" Goll shouts. When the silence holds, he adds, \"We\u0027ve come to help. Your boy told us you were in trouble. We\u0027re here to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe draws to a halt, since it\u0027s obvious nobody\u0027s going to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a ghost village,\" Ronan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re too late,\" Connla sniffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not,\" Fiachna disagrees. \"They might be sheltering underground, in a souterrain, where they can\u0027t hear us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two seem to think people do nothing but cower underground,\" Connla snorts, nodding at Fiachna and Orna. \"Why don\u0027t you just accept the simple truth that when nobody answers a call, it means they\u0027re all dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer to hope for the best,\" Orna says stiffly, \"even when I can see just as clearly as you that it\u0027s unlikely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smoke bread,\" Run Fast says bafflingly, leaning over so far that he almost topples into the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Goll says. \"We haven\u0027t come all this way to turn back now. If nothing else, the crannog offers a place to rest tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless it\u0027s been taken over by demons,\" Connla says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless it\u0027s been taken over by demons,\" Goll agrees. \"But we have to check. Lorcan, will you swim across and come back in a curragh for the rest of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorcan\u0027s the best swimmer in our tuath. Even when he was twelve years old, he could beat most grown men in a race. He steps forward now and studies the water, looking for demons. He can\u0027t see any but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s safe-they often hide down deep during the day, to avoid the rays of the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout saying anything, Lorcan undresses quickly, then dives in and strikes powerfully for the crannog. We watch nervously, Ronan having notched an arrow to his bow, ready to fire instantly if his brother comes under attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorcan makes it to the crannog unhindered and pulls himself out, pausing only to offer up a quick prayer of thanks to the gods. He brushes water from his stubbly hair-it comes off in rusty red drops, coloured by the blood caked into his scalp. Then he unties a leather-framed curragh and rows across to where we\u0027re waiting, hard strokes, one eye on the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorcan, Goll, Run Fast and Orna cross first. Then Lorcan rows back to pick up Ronan, Fiachna, Connla and me. At the gate I test the air for the scent of demons. It\u0027s clear. I don\u0027t think there are monsters in the village but I can\u0027t be certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will we try the gate or go over the fence?\" Goll asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gate\u0027s open,\" Fiachna says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoll squints, then chuckles. \"I was never the sharpest with two eyes, but with only one...\" He looks around. \"We\u0027ll go in fast. Any sign of trouble, retreat to the gate. Based on what we\u0027re facing, we\u0027ll decide then whether to fight or flee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep breath. Weapons drawn. A signal from Goll. In.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo demons. No people either. Just a few chickens and lots of blood. While we stand a few paces inside the gate, Run Fast chases after the chickens, laughing. They squawk and flap away from him. With his speed he could catch them easily, but he\u0027s only playing with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027re all dead?\" Orna asks, eyes narrow, nose wrinkled against the stench of fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless they\u0027re hiding,\" Goll grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should check the huts,\" Fiachna says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\" Goll points at Ronan, Fiachna, Connla and me. \"You four go right. The rest of us will go left. We\u0027ll meet in the middle if all\u0027s clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Run Fast?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoll looks at the boy chasing the chickens. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027d be much help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set off quickly, each of us aware of the rapidly setting sun. It\u0027s almost the time of the Fomorii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first hut. Holes have been torn in the walls, so it\u0027s easy to peer in. Floor caked in drying blood but otherwise empty. No trapdoor or hiding place. We push on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second hut\u0027s smaller than the first. A tiny entrance. No holes in the walls. Dark pools of shadows. We stick our heads through the doorway, allowing our eyes to adjust to the gloom. Objects gradually swim into sight. Pots, a small table, a broken chair. Rugs on the floor-there could be a souterrain beneath. We slide in, Ronan first, me last, looking up for winged demons hanging from the thatch. The men search beneath the rugs-nothing. They file out. I\u0027m bringing up the rear, almost through the door, when something breathes behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beccccccc...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop... turn... eyes wide... heart beating fast. I stare into the shadows. I can\u0027t see anything but I know I\u0027m not alone. I want to duck out of the door or call for help but I can\u0027t. My tongue is frozen, not with fear, but magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong, terrifying seconds pass. Then, in a blur, claws dart out of the darkness... a twisted face... fiery eyes... a savage mouth filled with rows of teeth... the demon grabs me! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-7.html","bookId":2178,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:45:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:45:42 PM"}
