She wouldn’t lose it. She couldn’t lose it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what I have become? She felt sick. I have to recover. Somehow. She forced herself to let go of the mindtrap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Last Battle was upon them; already, Trollocs poured into the southern lands. It was a new War of the Shadow, but only she and the other Chosen knew the deeper secrets of the One Power. The ones she hadn’t been forced to give up to those horrible women . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, don’t think about that. The pain, the suffering, the failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this war, they faced no Hundred Companions, no Aes Sedai with centuries of skill and practice. She would prove herself, and past errors would be forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin continued to stare at those impossible flames. The only sounds were that of the fire and of the water that boiled near it. He would eventually explain his purpose in summoning her, wouldn’t he? He had been acting increasingly strange, lately. Perhaps his madness was returning. Once, the man named Moridin—or Ishamael, or Elan Morin Tedronai—would have delighted in holding a cour’souvra for one of his rivals. He would have invented punishments, thrilled in her agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been some of that at the start; then . . . he had lost interest. He spent more and more time alone, staring into flames, brooding. The punishments he had administered to her and Cyndane had seemed almost routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found him more dangerous this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gateway split the air just to the side of the platform. \"Do we really need to do this every other day, Moridin?\" Demandred asked, stepping through and into the World of Dreams. Handsome and tall, he had jet hair and a prominent nose. He gave Moghedien a glance, noting the mindtrap on her neck before continuing. \"I have important things to do, and you interrupt them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are people you need to meet, Demandred\", Moridin said softly. \"Unless the Great Lord has named you Nae’blis without informing me, you will do as you are told. Your playthings can wait\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred’s expression darkened, but he did not object further. He let the gateway close, then moved to the side, looking down into the sea. He frowned. What was in the waters? She hadn’t looked. She felt foolish for not having done so. What had happened to her caution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred walked to one of the chairs near her, but did not sit. He stood, contemplating Moridin from behind. What had Demandred been doing? During her period bound to the mindtrap, she had done Moridin’s bidding, but had never found an answer to Demandred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered again, thinking of those months under Moridin’s control. I will have vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’ve let Moghedien free\", Demandred said. \"What of this . . . Cyndane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is not your concern\", Moridin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoghedien had not failed to notice that Moridin still wore Cyndane’s mindtrap. Cyndane. It meant \"last chance\" in the Old Tongue, but the woman’s true nature was one secret that Moghedien had discovered. Moridin himself had rescued Lanfear from Sindhol, freeing her from the creatures that feasted upon her ability to channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to rescue her, and of course to punish her, Moridin had slain her. That had allowed the Great Lord to recapture her soul and place it in a new body. Brutal, but very effective. Precisely the kind of solution the Great Lord preferred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin was focused on his flames, and Demandred on him, so Moghedien used the chance to slip out of her seat and walk to the edge of the floating stone platform. The water below was completely clear. Through it she could see people very distinctly. They floated with their legs chained to something deep below, arms bound behind them. They swayed like kelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were thousands of them. Each of them looked up at the sky with wide, horrified eyes. They were locked in a perpetual state of drowning. Not dead, not allowed to die, but constantly gasping for air and finding only water. As she watched, something dark reached up from below and pulled one of them down into the depths. Blood rose like a blooming flower; it caused the others to struggle all the more urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoghedien smiled. It did her good to see someone other than herself suffering. These might simply be figments, but it was possible that they were ones who had failed the Great Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother gateway opened at the side of the platform, and an unfamiliar woman stepped through. The creature had alarmingly unpleasant features, with a hooked yet bulbous nose and pale eyes that were off center with one another. She wore a dress that tried to be fine, of yellow silk, but it only served to highlight the woman’s ugliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoghedien sneered and returned to her seat. Why was Moridin admitting a stranger to one of their meetings? This woman could channel; she must be one of those useless women who called themselves Aes Sedai in this Age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, Moghedien thought, sitting, she is powerful How had Moghedien missed noticing one with this talent among the Aes Sedai? Her sources had picked out that wretched lightskirt Nynaeve almost immediately, yet they’d missed this hag?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is who you wish us to meet?\" Demandred said, lips turning down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\", Moridin said absently. \"You’ve met Hessalam before\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHessalam? It meant . . . \"without forgiveness\" in the Old Tongue. The woman met Moghedien’s eyes proudly, and there was something familiar about her stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have things to be about, Moridin\", the newcomer said. \"This had better be—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoghedien gasped. The tone in that voice . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not take that tone with me\", Moridin cut in, speaking softly, not turning. \"Do not take it with any of us. Currently, even Moghedien is favored more than you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Graendal?\" Moghedien asked, horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not use that name!\" Moridin said, spinning on her, the burning water flaring up. \"It has been stripped from her\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraendal—Hessalam—sat down without looking again at Moghedien. Yes, the way the woman carried herself was right. It was her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoghedien almost chortled with glee. Graendal had always used her looks as a bludgeon. Well, now they were a bludgeon of a different type. How perfect! The woman must be positively writhing inside. What had she done to earn such a punishment? Graendal’s stature—her authority, the myths told about her—were all linked to her beauty. What now? Would she have to start searching for the most horrid people alive to keep as pets, the only ones who could c \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-20.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
