Ernst knew whose room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the meaning of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just following orders,\" one of the Kickers said. \"The boss told us to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the room. \"Right inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst raised his black, silver-headed cane. \"Out of my way! Out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey scuttled to the sides, leaving him a clear path through the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a number of days\u0027 absence, he\u0027d returned to the Lodge and had been shocked to see its street fa\u0026amp;ccedil;ade defaced by a pair of steel window shutters on the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stormed into the room and found Hank Thompson staring out one of those windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shutters must come down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson smiled as he turned to face him. \"Morning, Drexler. How\u0027re they hanging?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was goading. Thompson seemed to take inordinate pleasure in annoying him. Well, Ernst was already annoyed - more than annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remove those shutters immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson gave him a cold stare. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a historic building. You cannot deface it like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s defaced? These are primo roll-up hurricane shutters. Heaviest of the heavy duty. Watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a remote, pointed it at the nearest window, and pressed a button. With a soft clatter, a ribbed steel sheet unrolled from the cylinder at the top and slid down the tracks attached to either side of the frame. He pointed the remote at the other window and the same happened, darkening the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Pretty neat, huh? And if there\u0027s a power failure, I\u0027ve got a little gadget that lets me crank them up and down by hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you gone mad? This is totally irrational. You\u0027re on the second floor. Someone would have to put up a ladder in full view of the street and the claque of your followers who drape themselves on the front steps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson\u0027s smile faltered. \"What if what wants in isn\u0027t human? What if it flies through the air?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst stared at him. He had gone mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027It\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Kicker Man warned me. He hasn\u0027t led me wrong yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he talking about the Change? Had he had some sort of premonition and was preparing for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst hoped he was wasting his time, hoped that Jack, the man Thompson hated so fiercely, had succeeded in stopping the One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So don\u0027t waste your breath telling me to undo this. It stays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst turned toward the new door. \"And this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steel. With a big bar across it. The walls are stone, two feet thick on the outside, a foot on the inside.\" He looked around, nodding. \"Yep, I\u0027ll be safe here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst saw no point in continuing the conversation, so he walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the One? Alive? Dead? He wished he could call Jack. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-66.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
