I will not marry you, even if it is the easiest way of survival.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” Julien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We deserve happiness. Both of us. I may struggle longer, but do not fear. I will seize personal happiness if I must shake it from Queen Freja with my bare hands,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comment drew a chuckle from Julien, making him less strained. “But what will we do? My father will never let me marry Margrit, and Aveyron…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aveyron is my concern. If I drive myself to ruin, it will be through my own stubbornness—from which you cannot save me,” Cinderella wryly observed. “And I understand your concerns with your father…but do you really think he can spare you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are his only son, and while I love Cerise, she would make a poor heir. Your father knows this. We are in an unfortunate time because of the financial burdens and stresses placed on us, but we are also in the perfect time, because in such uncertain days as these, we can change and defy traditional thought patterns and beliefs,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Julien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forgive my impertinence, but when else in history could a duchess wear servant clothes and work in the market without worry of alienation from her fellow nobles?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or when would a duchess condescend to even think of marrying the son of an earl?” Julien said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My point is your father doesn’t have anyone else who will see to your estate. He will likely yell at you and be enraged with you for a few months, but I think he will come around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulien nodded. “Mother will cheer for me, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella nodded. “Perhaps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulien smiled widely, without restraint. It startled Cinderella to realize she had never seen Julien look so happy before. “But what of you, Cinderella?” Julien said after a few moments, his smile dimming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella shrugged. “I have survived these two, soon to be three years. Every time I think I am at the end of my rope, I find I have just a little more strength. I am stubborn and wild. Queen Freja cannot hope to beat me,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you marry your Erlauf officer, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella pressed her lips together. “I don’t know,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? You must care for him seeing as you stood against our peers for the sake of your association with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not entirely certain what he feels for me. He mostly seems to be serious, but there are things he says…” Cinderella shook her head. “I don’t know, but even if I do not marry him, I will be quite happy at Aveyron.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulien nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t we a pair,” Cinderella laughed. “Once lauded as the sparkling future of the remaining Trieux line of nobility, we are both infatuated with the enemy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They aren’t really the enemy. Not anymore,” Julien earnestly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmhmm. I do not think the whole country, or even a sizeable portion of it, would agree with you,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps not, but when they see that we can intermingle—if, no, when I marry Margrit—changes will come ‘round. They already have. Thanks to your friendship with Colonel Friedrich, you are a beautiful example of noble decorum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella looked down at her patched dress. “Oh yes,” she said in a dead voice. “I can see I am in a very pretty spot right now. Hah-hah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You solely look at your outward appearance,” Julien argued. “I can assure you, in the people’s eyes, you wear a crown and jewels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you are overestimating me, but I thank you for the compliment all the same,” Cinderella said. “Now, tell me of this Erlauf miss of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He waxed poetry over her gentle manners and soft voice. With all the sweet and kind descriptions he used, I half wonder if this girl is a kitten. Truly, Marie, I think he would have been miserable with me. I am too wild and passionate for him,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie scowled at Cinderella. “You’re just trying to convince me you’ve done the right thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie sighed. “I doubt poor Julien would have learned to say no to you. But if you ruled out Marcus, turned Julien away, and discounted Colonel Friedrich—,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My life will be complete even if I do not marry in the next year, Marie,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but it is such a shame. I mean, Colonel Friedrich is deliciously handsome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marie! You are married!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but that does not mean I am not shallow for your sake,” Marie said with a wicked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella rolled her eyes in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will celebrate Aveyron’s momentary freedom before Queen Freja can smack me with another fine,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful,” Marie pronounced. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-56.html","bookId":1806,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM"}
