Not even if she melted into his kiss like she\u0027d been starving for it all her life. Not even if she begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood dripped from his split knuckles, a faint patter in the quiet night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to do the right thing. He had to keep her safe— even from himself. No matter how much he wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid looked at the door, still swinging loose on its hinges. She\u0027d forgotten her vest and the gun he\u0027d insisted she take with her whenever she left the cabin. If she wasn\u0027t careful, she\u0027d run into one of the protections he\u0027d set up in a perimeter around the cabin. They were primitive, but lethal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spat out a searing oath and followed her outside. He didn\u0027t know how he was going to resist kissing her again when he found her out in the moonlit night, but he had to find a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIFTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle didn\u0027t hear his approach, but she sensed him just before she saw his large form slip out from between the trees not two feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark outside and Noelle hadn\u0027t gone far—just far enough that she couldn\u0027t see the cabin through the thick trees. Just far enough that she could feel like she was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing alone made it easier to accept David\u0027s rejection and remind herself of what was truly important in life. Her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t a fool. She hadn\u0027t forgotten what was at stake if she failed her task to discover the hidden meaning intheciphertext.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot your vest,\" said David. His voice was barely more than a whisper of dark sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind shifted restlessly through the branches of the trees, scattering dry leaves. It smelled of frost and woodsmoke mixed with a hint of David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered if she\u0027d ever forget the way he smelled. The way he tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle didn\u0027t take the vest from his hand. She felt safe out here, no matter how foolish it was for her to feel that way. The only threat she faced was David\u0027s ability to make her lose control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a frustrated sigh and slid the vest over her arms. His arms reached around her to fasten the straps, putting her once again in his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle looked up at him, already feeling the way her body responded to his nearness like a drug. An addictive one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart sped and her nostrils flared to pull in his scent. His motions were jerky but gentle as he pulled the straps taut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows hid his eyes, but accentuated the tight line of his jaw. He\u0027d shaved recently, she noticed, and she could smell the faint scent of soap on his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesire rioted through her belly, making her feel weak and breathless. She\u0027d never felt this way about Stanley, nor anyone else for that matter. Her reaction to David was unique and utterly mystifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away, and the loss of his body heat was immediate. She shivered and wrapped her arms around her body to warm herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get back to the cabin,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle couldn\u0027t stand the thought of being closed up with him in such a small space. At least not unless he was going to finish what he started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come back in a little while. I just need some air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded but didn\u0027t move. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you, Noelle. I swear. I just...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle tightened her grasp around her middle, trying to ease the empty ache that chilled her from the inside. \"We don\u0027t have to talk about this. Just forget that kiss ever happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a jackass and I\u0027m sorry. I should never have let my feelings get in the way of the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job. That\u0027s what was really important here—not her feelings, or David\u0027s. They had a job to do, and lives depended on their success. \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said. The words were hollow because it sure didn\u0027t feel okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not. It sucks ass, but that\u0027s the way it is. That\u0027s the way it has to be. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle understood perfectly. His wife had been murdered by the same men who were trying to kill her. Neither one of them had any business getting involved with each other. They both had jobs to do, and neither was getting any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give me some time alone to clear my head so I can focus on my work.\" She needed to think and she couldn\u0027t do that when he was standing so close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long pause, David nodded. \"Don\u0027t be long,\" he said as he slipped back into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle stared up at the clear night sky. She could do this. She was strong enough to resist him. And smart enough to know there was no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen slid deeper into his hidey-hole, grinning. They\u0027d kissed. How sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was too distracted by Noelle and his obvious lust for her to notice Owen in his hiding place not two hundred feet from the cabin. From here he had a clear view of the tension tightening Noelle\u0027s slender arms around her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could also see David keeping watch over her from a few yards away, his face hardened with frustration and guilt. Poor baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark, Owen doubted she could see David guarding her, and if he\u0027d left her alone, Owen would have had a hard time resisting the urge to move in too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Lark was breathing down his neck, anxious to get his hands on those weapons—or more importantly, the money they would bring on the black market. He\u0027d already started preparing a list of well-funded customers for the auction, which put undue pressure on Owen to hurry. When he did earn that coveted place at Mr. Lark\u0027s right hand, he was going to have to teach the man that money wasn\u0027t everything. Power was much more important— more enjoyable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—and although money could buy power, fear could buy even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe auction was just going to have to wait. Owen was enjoying himself too much to hurry, considering how his plans had just shifted with that kiss. Noelle was no longer just some high-powered brain. She was a woman that David cared enough about to kiss, which made her much more interesting. And useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SIXTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle hadn\u0027t made any progress for over twenty-four hours. Not one spark of insight, not one sliver of success. The code was winning and people were going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had always worked well under pressure—there were few academics who didn\u0027t—but this level of pressure was more than she was able to handle. She was beginning to think that she\u0027d failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bowl of soup he\u0027d put in front of her an hour ago had cooled, been reheated and cooled again. It smelled great, but her stomach roiled at the thought of eating. She knew it was stupid to starve herself like this. It was even counterproductive, but every time she did anything but focus on the problem, her head started filling with images from those horrible pictures David had shown her. It had gotten so bad that she was unable to sleep, or even close her eyes for very long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t had more than a few short naps since they\u0027d arrived at the cabin, and except for that nap in the woods, she had only slept a couple of times at the table, bent over her work in exhaustion. If this didn\u0027t stop soon, she was going to go insane. And welcome it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should try to rest for a while,\" said David from the cabin door. She had no idea how long he\u0027d been standing there, watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body nearly filled the doorway, blocking out the bright rays of sunshine behind him. He\u0027d shaved recently, and even though the stubble was gone, he looked no less dangerous. His hair had grown out some to reveal even more splinters of silver in the black hair at his temples, making her wonder if his body was just really fit for his age, or if his hair was going prematurely gray. Based on what she knew of his past, she guessed the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always when he left the cabin, he wore his Kevlar vest. Under it was a long-sleeved flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up to reveal his thick forearms and all the beguihng muscles she couldn\u0027t help but notice. From the dark stain of sweat around his collar, she guessed he\u0027d been chopping wood again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to do that a lot, which made her wonder just how long he expected them to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than chopping wood, he spent much of his time outside the cabin during the day, doing God only knew what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of times, he\u0027d brought back some fish and even a rabbit, which Noelle staunchly refused to eat. She wasn\u0027t a vegetarian, but Thumper was absolutely not on the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could sleep, but every time I close my eyes, all I see is the code scrolling through my head.\" And the faces of the dead. She didn\u0027t tell him that, though. What was the point? It would only make him feel guilty for having shown her the photos. He had plenty of self-imposed guilt without her help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle shut the screen of her laptop to conserve the battery. David had said there was plenty of fuel to run the generator for several weeks if they only used it to recharge her laptop and pump water. She hoped breaking this code wouldn\u0027t take nearly that long because she knew her body wouldn\u0027t hold up that long under the stress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid closed the door, making the cabin seem smaller by his mere presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to get cold tonight,\" he said as he stripped out of his vest and hung it on a nail beside the door next to Noelle\u0027s vest and coat. \"There\u0027s no cloud cover to hold the heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get cold? It\u0027s already cold.\" Noelle wore a jacket, and she sat snuggled inside her sleeping bag at the table to keep her legs and feet warm while she worked. And even that wasn\u0027t enough insulation. Going outside was even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing strictly an indoor sort of girl had givenher no experience for the joy of sitting on frozen wood while icy drafts blasted her butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in her life, Noelle wished she could pee standing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to get colder, but I\u0027ll be sure to keep the fire built up tonight, before it starts to get dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t help,\" she said. She set her glasses on the table and thrust her hand into her hair in frustration, where her fingers immediately got caught in the thick tangle of curls. Had she remembered to brush her hair today? She didn\u0027t think so, but the days ran together when she didn\u0027t sleep, so maybe she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s blue eyes slid over her body and searched her face. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about not telling him, but knew that in the end, he\u0027d figure it out anyway. Besides, talking about it couldn\u0027t make things any worse. \"I\u0027ve hit a wall. Hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt shame burn high on her cheekbones. \"I\u0027ve run every decryption algorithm I\u0027ve ever developed in every permutation possible. There\u0027s something else in this code that I sensed the first time I looked at it—some elusive quality that seems to shift every time I think I see the pattern. It\u0027s mathematical, I know that much, but there is something more. Something almost arcane in the way the symbols are strung together.\" She trailed off, shaking her head. \"No matter how long I work, the solution keeps evading me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should try to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle rubbed her tired eyes. \"I can\u0027t. This isn\u0027t just a matter of passing a course, or even completing my dissertation. People\u0027s lives are at stake. If I fail, people will die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a lot of pressure to be putting on yourself. You\u0027re not used to it. Relax. Give it time. As long as you\u0027re safe, that\u0027s what matters. You can take all the time you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed out a frustrated sigh. \"It\u0027s hard to relax when I keep banging my head against the same wall.\" She looked at him, hoping he wouldn\u0027t see the desperation that threatened to overwhelm her. \"What if I can\u0027t do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it.\" He sounded utterly confident. \"What do you normally do when you hit a rough patch? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-22.html","bookId":2374,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM"}
