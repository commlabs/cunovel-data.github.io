Those are the important subjects, don’t you think?” Annie searched Bethanne’s face for confirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do, but a single comment on the subject doesn’t mean Vance is ready to propose, Annie.” Bethanne’s voice was gentle, but inside she marveled at her daughter’s naiveté. She didn’t want Annie to set herself up for disappointment. A mother never outgrew her protective instincts, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I know, but Nicole saw him at a jewelry store in the University District. It only makes sense that he was looking at engagement rings. Why else does a guy go to a jeweler?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor any number of reasons, but Bethanne couldn’t bring herself to burst her daughter’s bubble. “When’s the hot date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friday night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fabulous. I hope everything works out.” Either way—engagement or not—she had concerns, but this wasn’t the time to discuss them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Mom.” Annie just about skipped down the hall toward her own office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annie,” Bethanne called out, stopping her. “I have a bit of news myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter turned back, anxiety clouding her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I saw your grandma, she told me she’s planning to drive to Florida next week. I’ve decided to go with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie’s mouth sagged open. “You and Grandma are driving to Florida?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne laughed. “Don’t say it like that. We’re two mature women who can look after ourselves. Your grandmother’s wanted to make a road trip across the country nearly her entire adult life, and for one reason or another it’s always been put off. She’s determined to go—and I can’t let her go alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Aunt Robin?” As soon as the words were out, Annie shook her head. “Never mind. Aunt Robin wouldn’t take the time for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne nodded. “It was a…sudden decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the business?” Annie nodded in the direction of the conference room, where the various store managers would soon be gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julia can handle whatever comes up in the next few weeks,” Bethanne said calmly. “I’ll be accessible by phone and email, if she really needs me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie stared at Bethanne. “Wow, Mom, taking off on the spur of the moment—that isn’t like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True, but I’ve got a lot to think about right now, and this will give me a chance to weigh my options.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Dad know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet,” Bethanne said, waving as she hurried to the conference room. “I’m sure your grandmother will tell him when the time is right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting with Julia was abbreviated due to the arrival of the managers. Afterward, Julia and Bethanne parted with a promise to catch up the following day. When she finally made it back to her office to return phone calls, Bethanne saved Grant’s for last. The commercial real estate market was still depressed across the country, but it had recently started to pick up in the Seattle area. As the broker in charge of one of his company’s most successful offices, Grant had significant responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis assistant connected her immediately. “Bethanne,” he said, sounding grateful to hear from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Grant. Annie told me you called.” She got right to the point; they were both busy people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me, when did our little girl become such a dynamic young businesswoman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne smiled. “I believe she inherited her talent from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know about that,” Grant countered. “You’re the business powerhouse these days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant had always been skilled at making everyone feel special—like the most important person in the room—and it had served him well in his career. Now he was turning that charm on her, something he hadn’t done in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called about dinner on Friday. You never did say if you were available.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t need a reminder; his invitation had been on her mind for the past three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we’d go to that little Mexican restaurant we used to like so much,” he went on, obviously—and correctly—interpreting her silence as hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re still at the same location, can you believe it?” He laughed nervously. “What do you say? You and me, for old times’ sake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne closed her eyes, her knuckles white around the receiver. She was decidedly tired of that expression. “Not all our old times were that happy, Grant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” he was quick to admit. “But we do need to discuss Andrew’s wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can do that just as easily over the phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could…” Grant conceded. “But I’d much rather do it over a margarita.” She heard him sigh. “You used to like yours on the rocks. Do you still prefer them that way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne couldn’t recall the last time she’d even had a margarita. Too many hours in the office and not nearly enough fun. “I suppose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, will you have dinner with me Friday night?” He wasn’t pleading, but she thought she detected a note of yearning in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled and, with her arm hugged tight around her middle, finally said, “All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll pick you up—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll meet you at the restaurant at seven,” she interjected, far more comfortable providing her own transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seven,” he repeated, not bothering to hide his enthusiasm. “See you then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne sat at her desk late Friday afternoon and reviewed the latest figures Julia had given her on the other five stores. She was fortunate that in a struggling economy, Parties continued to thrive. Julia had various suggestions she wanted Bethanne to consider, and in the past months Bethanne had come to rely on her more and more. If it wasn’t for her operations manager, she wouldn’t be able to take time off to travel with her mother-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the years since the start-up of Parties, her business had experienced steady growth and, according to Julia, there was huge potential for the future as long as they were judicious about their finances and their expansion plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the benefits of her success was the knowledge that she could travel anyplace in the world she desired, something she’d long dreamed about. This was heady for Bethanne. She had good business instincts, as well as basic skills she’d learned watching her husband and his colleagues. Because her ideas were so innovative, she’d received more than her share of attention from the press. She kept copies of the articles written about her novel approach to parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for the folder, she leafed through it, scanning each news clipping and magazine article with a sense of pride and accomplishment. She paused at last year’s photograph of herself smiling at the camera, standing outside this building, which housed the original Parties. The photo was flattering. She was at her leanest, her shoulder-length brown hair turned up slightly at the ends. Not bad for forty-seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’d seen the picture, her thought had been that she looked happy. It was at that moment that she’d realized she was over Grant. Life did go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after that photo was published with a profile of her in USA Today, Annie told her that Tiffany had left Grant and filed for divorce. A few days later, Grant had called to give Bethanne the news himself; it was the first time they’d spoken in months. He’d sounded depressed, and Bethanne had felt sympathetic. After all, she’d been there….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant. Her thoughts had turned to him often since his call earlier in the week. After years of forcing him from her mind, she found it uncomfortable to be entertaining memories of him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne checked her watch. If she was going to be on time to meet her ex-husband at Zapata’s, she needed to leave the office now. Because it was the start of the Memorial Day weekend, she was caught in heavy traffic and arrived at the restaurant ten minutes late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she entered the dining room, the scent of fried tortilla chips and spicy salsa triggered a wave of nostalgia. When they were first married, this hole-in-the-wall restaurant had been their favorite. They could order a bean burrito, plus two tacos with rice and beans, and split the dinner for $5.50, including tip. If they had extra money, they bought a single margarita with two straws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been important to them both that Bethanne stay home with the children until they were in school. Once Annie went into first grade, Bethanne had been prepared to finish her degree and rejoin the workforce, but Grant had asked her not to. She was his partner, his support—and he liked having her available to manage the day-to-day tasks that allowed him to focus on his career. Bethanne had agreed; by then he was doing well financially and he always let her know how much he appreciated her support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing her across the room, Grant stood and waved. The small restaurant was crowded. Almost every seat was taken and the wait-staff angled between tables, carrying trays of drinks with chips and salsa. Mariachi music blared from the speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne made her way over to Grant, who’d remained standing. He immediately helped her remove her jacket. He’d always been attentive about those gentlemanly details. He would open a door for her or pull out her chair as a matter of course—but he didn’t hesitate to rip out her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refused to let the old bitterness overtake her. She’d never been the vindictive type, and she’d worked hard to put the past behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ordered you a margarita,” Grant said as he slid her chair under her. She felt his hand graze her shoulder, lingering just a second beyond casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warm chips and salsa were already there. Bethanne’s stomach growled as she reached for one, wondering if the salsa was still as spicy as she remembered. One bite assured her it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The menu’s almost unchanged after all these years,” Grant said as he sat down across from her. He held her look for a moment before opening his menu again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this place brought back memories for him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see the prices have changed,” she remarked, scanning her own menu. A picture of the Mexican general adorned the plastic front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “Well, I guess we can afford it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne didn’t recognize any of the staff. The waitress brought two margaritas over ice, each with a thick ring of salt around the rim of the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least we can have two drinks this time around,” Grant said, watching her lick the salt off her glass and take a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis familiar use of we made it sound as if they were a couple again, but she didn’t react. “I hope the same holds true for dinner,” she said mildly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-4.html","bookId":1940,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM"}
