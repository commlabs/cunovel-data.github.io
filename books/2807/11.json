Summer Olympics, here I come. Assuming they held the races at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on one of the side streets behind Minneapolis General Hospital, and figured I should go inside and call a cab. I sure as hell wasn\u0027t going back to the cemetery-I wasn\u0027t meeting up with any of those losers ever again. And if I ever saw that rat bastard Elvis wannabee sociopath again, I\u0027d have his eyeballs for...for something disgusting you\u0027d use eyeballs for. Every time I thought of his hands on me, his thumb in my mouth, I got hot. No, dammit, that\u0027s not what I meant...I got pissed. Really pissed. I should shove my fingers in his mouth, see how he likes it. I should shove my fingers into his windpipe! Up his ass! Around his--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now I was really stomping down the street, so I was almost relieved when a dull voice cut through the light traffic and the other night noises: \"See ya, world.\" Yes! Something to distract me from the unsettling events of the last hour, praise God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up. Six stories above, a guy a few years younger than me was standing on the ledge. He was looking down, straight at me. I knew at once he was waiting until I got out of the way so he could jump without taking the chance of splattering himself all over me. I stopped walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building was an old one, built of rough brick, and as I put my hands on the wall, testing the texture, I had a thought-a brainstorm, really. They really are like storms for me-it\u0027s like there\u0027s this crash and then I\u0027ve got a brand new idea from nowhere. Anyway, I pulled myself up and started to climb. In no time I was skittering up the side of the building like a big blonde bug. I was pissed about what had happened in the cemetery, and worried for the guy on the roof, but couldn\u0027t help also being elated at what I was doing. I was climbing six stories...me! I couldn\u0027t even climb that damned rope in gym class, not even the easy one with the rubber grips. And it was easy. It was wonderful! It required about as much effort as opening a can of Pringles. I was fast, I was strong, I was...I was SpiderVamp!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to the top and gave a little jump, which sent me soaring a few feet in the air, only to land on the roof and go into a deep bow. \"Ta-dah!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was really cute. Dressed in scrubs which-uh-oh-smelled like dried blood, here was another guy with deep black hair. Except while Finger Boy gave off an air of understated menace, this fella was throwing off vibes of exhausted despair. His hair was cut brutally short, his eyes were dark green, and he had a goatee that made him look like a tired devil. He was lightly tanned and thin, almost too thin. He stared at me with eyes gone huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you been eating?\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must really be tired,\" he said, more to himself than to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice try, but I\u0027m no illusion. Although in these second-rate tennis shoes, I ought to be. Why d\u0027you want to jump? What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked at me and shifted his weight. He wasn\u0027t nervous to be talking to me, not at all. Probably thought he could jump long before I got to him. And he was so sad and unhappy; nothing was surprising him tonight. \"I\u0027m sick of kids dying, I\u0027m in debt up to my tits for medical school, my dad\u0027s got cancer, I haven\u0027t had sex in two months, and I\u0027m being kicked out of my apartment because the owner sold his house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s pretty bad,\" I admitted. \"Except for the sex thing...I once went two years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pondered that one for a minute, shaking his head. \"What about you? What happened to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I died earlier this week, found out I can\u0027t die again, my stepmother stole all my good shoes, I can\u0027t eat any kind of food, I raped a perfectly nice guy last night, met a bunch of vampires who turned out to be every bad movie stereotype imaginable, and threw a really bad vamp through a stone cross. Then I saw you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But don\u0027t be scared. I\u0027m still a nice person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re not raping men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. How about we go get a cup of coffee, talk about why our lives suck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. The wind riffled his scrubs, but his hair was too short and didn\u0027t move. He glanced down at the street, then back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I coaxed. \"Vampires exist and you never had the faintest clue, right? I know I didn\u0027t. I mean, come on! Vampires? What year is this? But if we exist, think of all the other amazing things out there you don\u0027t know about. It\u0027s a little early to shut the book on your whole life, don\u0027t you think? What are you, twenty-five?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-seven. Are you just luring me down so you can feed on me to quench your unholy thirst?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy were people always asking me this sort of thing? \"No, I just don\u0027t want you to jump. I can wait a while for my next meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get down,\" he said slowly, \"if you\u0027ll make me your next meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly swooned at the excitement that simple statement brought. \"What have you been smoking? You just met me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and the last fifteen seconds have been the most interesting in the last three years. So...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pal, you have no idea what you\u0027re asking.\" I tried to sound tough and cool, but since I gasped out the whole sentence I sounded more like a horny cheerleader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I do. Part of the reason I\u0027m up here is-you were right, I figured there\u0027s nothing new in the world except death and people being shitty to each other. I never should have been a doctor. Never wanted to be. But my dad-anyway, it\u0027s just death and paperwork and more death.\" He trailed off and I saw his eyes shine with unshed tears. He blinked them back. \"Anyway. Sorry. So, prove me wrong. Prove a few more things, besides. I want to feel what it\u0027s like. I want to feel something besides-besides nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip. The poor guy! \"Forget it.\" But I was sidling toward him. I was thirsty, and here was a perfectly sane (as sane as a clinically depressed suicidal man could be) specimen offering to be my dinner. I was nuts to turn it down. The alternative was taking it by force from some poor jerk. Why in the world would I hurt or scare someone, when there was a willing guy standing right in front of me? At least he wasn\u0027t all goo-goo eyed and mumbling about my beauty, such as it was. He was perfectly clear-eyed, and curious, and what was the harm? And why was I trying to convince myself? I had to eat, right? Why was I still talking to myself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay...if I do this...\" I did a fairly good imitation of Reluctant Night Stalker. \"...you promise not to jump?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or leap in front of a truck or take a bath with your toaster or comb your hair with a chainsaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. He looked years younger when he did that. He wasn\u0027t afraid at all. And that made up my mind for me. \"I promise. Now do it, cutie, before I come to my senses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled him off the ledge, gently. Brought him to me like a lover. His shirt had a v-neck, so I just pulled him toward me and bit him. He gasped and went rigid in my arms, then his arms came around me in a strangler\u0027s grip. He went up on his toes and his hips pistoned toward mine. His blood was slowly spilling into my mouth and it tasted like the lushest, most potent wine ever made. My unbearable thirst became-if possible-even more unbearable for a split second, then abruptly abated. Sounds were sharper, the light-such as it was-became brighter. His heartbeat pounded in my ears and he was breathing in ragged gasps. I could smell his sex, hard and urgent and pressing against me, the smell of musk, the smell of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled away. Another thing the movies got wrong. Vampires didn\u0027t have to drain a person dry...heck, I\u0027d probably had half a cup, if that much. And it would last me the rest of the night, easily. I could drink more, of course, but it would be for pure pleasure, not need. I bet that creep from the cemetery drank ten times a night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" my dinner gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s all I need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-uh-what are you--?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was fumbling at the drawstring of his pants, tugging, and then his pants were around his ankles and he was pulling his turgid cock from the slit in his boxers (navy, with red stripes, my mind reported helpfully). His erection filled his hand; his cock wasn\u0027t terribly long, but was certainly thick, and pre-come glistened at the tip. He gripped himself so hard his knuckles went white and, while I watched in stupefaction, pumped once, twice, three times, and then he was coming, and I leapt out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other for a long moment, then he hurriedly stuffed his cock away and pulled up his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"As God is my witness, I have no idea what to say to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? What the hell did you do?\" He asked the question in a tone of total admiration. \"One minute I was miserable as hell, the next all I could think of was-uh-the exact opposite of dying.\" He colored, the blood rushing to his cheeks. I could almost hear it. \"I\u0027ve never done that before in front of-I\u0027m sorry. You have no idea how weird that is for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m not complaining. Now that I\u0027m recovering from the shock, I mean. It\u0027s no worse than what I did to you. Thanks for taking matters into your own hands, as opposed to planting your dick in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t rape that man,\" he said out of nowhere. His gaze was firm and uncompromising. \"If you bit someone and had sex with them...it wasn\u0027t rape. He wanted to. In fact, it was probably like he had to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to talk about that. Being overwhelmed by a bloodsucker and needing to fuck them didn\u0027t mean the bloodsucker wasn\u0027t the bad guy. \"Never mind. Let\u0027s get off this roof, what do you say...err...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Betsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Betsy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start. I can\u0027t help it if I\u0027ve got unholy powers and a stupid first name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again. It was the laugh that made us friends, which I thought was just fine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-11.html","bookId":2807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:50 PM"}
