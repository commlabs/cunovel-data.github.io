Bruno got his dimples and Gwen praised the Lord loudly, and hilariously, that he did and she did this often. Nearly every time she saw them which was a lot. Bruno, like his Mom, liked to laugh and, like his Mom, he did it often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that memory, Hawk smiled at his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife liked her husband’s dimples. Hawk just liked his son’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked out of the room and his cell went. He headed to the master suite pulling it out of a pocket of his cargoes. He turned the display to face him and his brows knit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt said “Gwen Calling”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer as his eyes went to their door, seeing weak light coming from under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was awake. This was surprising. It was late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nearly nine months pregnant with their, what Gwen decreed, final child. She’d decreed this because the ultrasound showed it was a boy. She was done. Giving up the ghost. She had a lifetime ahead of her of fights, blood, drunkenness, puke and pregnancy scares. She wasn’t going to make it worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was why he let her name their kids. Deacon was gestating in her belly. Hawk didn’t like the name Asher until Asher made it into the world. He really didn’t like the name Bruno until he met Bruno. And he seriously didn’t like the name Deacon but he reckoned he’d grow to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother had a hand in these names but Hawk didn’t complain. He saw the signs with Asher’s intensity and Bruno tackling everything. Gwen was f**ked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved the still ringing phone in his pocket as he twisted the knob and opened one of the double doors to the master suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk walked through and stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bedside light on Gwen’s side was on. The covers thrown back. The bed empty. A pool of blood was in the bed, a trail of it leading to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cabe, honey, you get this, go to the hospital.” He heard his wife’s voice, jerked out of his freeze and ran to the bathroom. “Something’s wrong. I’m calling…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped talking when he hit the bathroom and her head came up to look at him. She was sitting in her nightshirt on the floor, one arm around her swollen belly, one shapely leg straight, the other bent under her, her long, thick, blonde hair down and tousled, her blue eyes pained, her gorgeous face ashen, blood pooling around her on the black and white tiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute they hit him, her eyes filled with tears, she dropped her hand and it fell limply to her lap while she whispered, “Baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than five minutes later, Cabe “Hawk” Delgado had his wife strapped into the Expedition, his sons safely secured in the back, his phone ringing to Bax at his ear and he was backing out of the garage on his way to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Son,” Hawk heard and he tore his eyes from the window to look into Baxter Kidd’s. The minute their eyes locked, Bax flinched so Hawk knew what he was feeling was written on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBax’s hand came up and his fingers curled on Hawk’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This happened with Libby,” he said quietly. “Same thing, Cabe. Same exact thing. I didn’t say anything, Ash and Bruno were so easy, I thought…” He stopped, closed his eyes, sucked in an audible breath, opened his eyes and went on. “Libby was fine. Gwen was fine. And now, Gwen and Deacon are gonna be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk nodded once and looked back out the window. Bax’s fingers gave him a squeeze, disappeared and then Hawk felt his presence move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith and his mother had tried to get Hawk to agree to Tracy taking the boys away but Hawk refused to allow it. It might be the wrong decision but he didn’t give a f**k. They weren’t taking his boys from him. He needed his boys close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor had examined Gwen for about five seconds before he started barking orders, they urgently yanked her gurney out of the bay and rushed her down the hall. Gwen hadn’t uttered a word but her eyes never left him until they had no choice because she’d lost sight of him. They’d forced Hawk out of the bay and to the waiting room where Meredith and Bax were waiting with Ash and Bruno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been two hours since they’d wheeled his wife away. His mother and father showed, Von and Lucia, Jury and his wife Gloria, Tracy and her husband Uri, Cam and Leo, Elvira and her man Malik, Troy and his wife Keeley, Mrs. Mayhew – but they heard no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a f**king word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk’s gaze was at the window but all he saw were Gwen’s frightened, pain-filled eyes locked to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and shit collided in his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen’s body pressed to his, the silk of her dress under his hand, her smiling lips on his, her mouth tasting of frosting, her laughter sliding down his throat after they’d cut their wedding cake and shared bites. She’d pulled half an inch away and looked into his eyes before assuring him, “Don’t worry, baby, that little piece of cake won’t give you a gut.” After which he yanked her right back and kissed her so hard and so long, their audience started catcalling, hooting and he heard Elvira threaten to throw cold water on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen walking out of the bathroom when they were on vacation in Bermuda. The windows open, a breeze blowing the thin curtains in, the sounds of the ocean filling the room. She had her hands behind her back and was wearing a little, sexy nightgown, a smile playing at her mouth. He’d watched her as she’d come to the side of the bed, climbed in and straddled him then whipped her hand around and showed him the white stick with a pink plus sign on it. Then she’d tossed it to the floor, plastered her soft torso to his frozen one, framed his face in her hands and announced through a grin, “If it’s a boy, Maria and I have decided on Asher. If it’s a girl, you get to name her.” When she was done speaking, his arms went around her, he rolled her to her back and kept her occupied for the next two hours so she could say nothing more than moaning her sweet, “Baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing home late to see Gwen in Simone’s chair, her legs thrown over the side, her head rolled on the back, Ash cradled safe in her arms, both his boy and his woman asleep and neither had woken when he carried them in turns to their beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen, her belly slightly rounded with Bruno (but she was still in spiked heels), wandering The Monstrosity while Hawk, Ash at his hip, and the real estate agent watched. Then she’d walked to him, put her hand to his abs and proclaimed on a complete exaggeration, “This monstrosity is bigger than your lair.” He’d hooked her around the neck, pulled her deep into his body, kissed her hard while Ash banged them both with tiny baby fists and when he lifted his head, he kept her close but looked at the agent and stated, “We’ll take it.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-113.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
