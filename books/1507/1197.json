The old man’s voice echoed about, filled with venomous hatred. Although most people didn’t understand what an Allheaven Clan was, the Three Churches and Six Sects, as well as certain other groups, were completely shocked, and looked over at the Fang Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allheaven... Clan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as they looked over in astonishment, the enormous illusory net vanished, and Meng Hao shot up into the sky. His goal was clear; the shining yellow copper coin, which was now masterless, and slowly beginning to fall out of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved with incredible speed, and yet there were others in the crowd who also shot upward with lightning quickness. There were nine of them, all of whom headed directly toward the copper coin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, six of those people suddenly changed directions and headed toward Meng Hao instead of the copper coin, apparently with the intention of blocking his path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other three pushed even faster toward the copper coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Xiufeng’s face was calm. Next to him were Fang Shoudao and Fang Yanxu, neither of whom did anything. All of them had complete confidence in Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes shone coldly. The old man he had just killed with the help of the South Heaven Death Formation had been targeting the Fang Clan, so therefore, he intended to keep the copper coin as a battle trophy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he flashed through the air, his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture. Then he waved his hand, causing numerous Immortal mountains to descend, surrounded by boundless azure light. Of the group of six, three coughed up blood and immediately slowed down. The other three unleashed divine abilities and magical techniques. Instantly, the sky filled with splendid, multi-colored light, and the ripples of magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozens of enormous black lizards materialized, which roared as they charged toward Meng Hao. There was also a gigantic whip that slashed toward him like a dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast was a seven-colored rainbow, which emanated brilliant light that covered all Heaven and Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao snorted coldly and pressed forward, relying on the strength of his fleshly body to meet the divine abilities. Both hands stretched out in front of him and ripped to either side, causing the enormous black lizards to let out miserable screams as they were ripped to shreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout even slowing down, Meng Hao waved his right hand, grabbing the illusory whip and sending flame out to engulf it. In the blink of an eye, the whip became a writhing serpent of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, Meng Hao slammed into the rainbow, shattering it into countless fragments!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all happened so quickly that Meng Hao didn’t even slow down. He was now directly in front of the three cultivators who had just launched the divine abilities. Their faces flickered with disbelief, and before they could unleash more magic, Meng Hao waved his sleeve, causing a tempest to sweep over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed out of their mouths as Meng Hao passed them by. He didn’t kill them; today was the day his father became the Clan Chief, so unless it was absolutely necessary, he wouldn\u0027t kill anyone the way he had during the challenges earlier. He didn\u0027t want to turn the occasion into a massacre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, he was in front of the copper coin. As he reached out to grab it, the other three cultivators closed in, performing incantation gestures and sending out powerful attacks to block Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them summoned an enormous silver-colored bottle gourd that shot toward Meng Hao, emanating a powerful gravitational force as well as shocking screams that echoed in Meng Hao’s ears and mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw off!” he said, clenching his left hand into a fist and punching out with the power of God-Slaying. The silver gourd trembled and then exploded into pieces, scattering the vengeful ghosts that had been contained inside of it. The resulting backlash slammed into the cultivator who had launched the divine ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face fell as the vengeful ghosts slammed into him. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and his body withered as he tumbled backward. One of his fellows snorted coldly, ignoring the copper coin and shooting toward Meng Hao, eyes blazing as he burned his life force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was harming himself and even his cultivation base to prevent Meng Hao from taking the copper coin. The burning turned into the power of self-detonation, causing all faces to fill with shock as the man exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a sun detonating, causing blinding light to stab out in all directions. Meng Hao didn\u0027t retreat. Face cold, he waved his finger toward the expanding power of self-detonation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Sealing, Fifth Hex!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside Outside Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack when Meng Hao had acquired this Hex, his cultivation base had been too weak to fully unleash it. But now he had the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal, and could use it in its strongest form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, a huge rift appeared in front of him that looked like a gigantic mouth. It emanated an indescribably powerful gravitational force that sucked in the self-detonation power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened with incredible speed. One moment, everyone could sense the power of the self-detonation, the next moment, it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stared in shock as they realized that there were now only two people near the copper coin: Meng Hao, and another middle-aged cultivator in a black robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was staring at Meng Hao, eyes wide with fear. He could never have imagined that so many people wouldn’t even be able to slow Meng Hao down. Now there were only two of them vying for the coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hands reached out simultaneously to grab it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle-aged man’s eyes flickered as the aura of Karma suddenly emanated out from him. Instead of reaching out with his hand, countless Karma Threads shot out, swirling around him and then snaking toward the copper coin to entangle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ji Clan....” said Meng Hao, his eyes gleaming with killing intent. This middle-aged man had a cultivation base in the great circle of the Ancient Realm, but because of the bizarre nature of Ji Clan divine abilities, his power surpassed that of other people in the same Realm as him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That thing belongs to me!” the man cried out in a domineering voice. His Karma Threads latched onto the copper coin and jerked it toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dog fart of a Ji Clan!” Meng Hao roared. Azure light exploded off of him. He didn’t need to perform any incantation gestures; his magic responded to his very will. The azure light transformed into an illusory blade that instantly slashed toward the Ji Clan cultivator and his Karma Threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the Karma Threads were sliced in two. Blood sprayed out of the man’s mouth, and his body withered. At the same time, Meng Hao grabbed the copper coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout even looking at it, he branded it with divine sense and then tossed it into his bag of holding. Then he spun, hovering in midair as he stared coldly at the Ji Clan cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s face flickered as he glared back at Meng Hao. Then he snorted and started to back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I say you could leave?!” Meng Hao said, flashing in the man’s direction and waving his right finger. The air distorted, and the sky dimmed as the area surrounding the man began to collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s face flickered, and he bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of blood to unleash a secret magic, barely allowing him to escape the attack. Enraged, he cried out, “What do you think you’re doing, Meng Hao!? You really dare to try to kill me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown below, the other cultivators from the Ji Clan looked on with tranquil expressions. None of them seemed worried about what was happening at all, as if they were certain that Meng Hao wouldn\u0027t dare to kill a Ji Clan cultivator in front of so many witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was very solemn as he said, “Today is my dad’s coronation as Clan Chief, and yet some villains showed up and tried to sow chaos. Even though I’ve killed them already, I\u0027m still convinced that they were acting on the orders of someone else! A conspiracy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it weren’t for that, how would a trifling Quasi-Dao cultivator ever dare come and do such shocking things in my house?” Even as he spoke, he began to advance toward the Ji Clan cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m investigating this matter on behalf of the Fang Clan, which requires a thorough examination of this copper coin and its origins. And yet you... actually tried to stop me!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not only that, you fought me over the item! Why might that be? Could it be... that the Ji Clan is behind the conspiracy? Now that the Quasi-Dao cultivator is dead, you\u0027re worried that the Fang Clan might uncover the truth, and therefore wanted to get your hands on the evidence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t that true?!” Meng Hao spoke quickly and without pause, and with increasing intensity so that by the end he was practically bellowing. His words became like an explosion of thunder, after which he closed in on the man and unleashed a punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ji Clan cultivator\u0027s face fell, and he fought back with all his power. However, blood sprayed out of his mouth as he fell back. At the same time, the Ji Clan cultivators down below rose to their feet and looked up coldly at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao, cease this slander!” the man cried. “The Ji Clan had nothing to do with what happened. And even if we did, we wouldn’t need to hide the truth!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Oh, I understand. It wasn’t the Ji Clan; it was just you acting alone! So, you’re the person behind it all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What gall, you traitor! You wish to provoke the Fang Clan and Ji Clan into a war! I\u0027m going to kill you right here and now, as a warning to anyone who dares to try to incite strife between the Fang and Ji Clans!!” Eyes flashing, Meng Hao shot forward. Faces falling, the other Ji Clan cultivators present were about to block him, but then Meng Hao extended his hand and unleashed the Fifth Demon Sealing Hex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, it was not the Inside aspect, but the Outside aspect. A massive force exploded out, which was none other than the massively destructive self-detonation power from moments ago. Heaven and Earth distorted as the middle-aged cultivator was engulfed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, the explosion’s energies were directed outwards in all directions. But now, it was being focused completely on the Ji Clan cultivator by means of the Fifth Hex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man couldn’t even fight back. Rumbling sounds echoed out as he was instantly killed in body and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao!!” cried the other Ji Clan cultivators, several of whom flew up into the air, but were intercepted by members of the Fang Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoists of the Ji Clan, there’s no need to offer me thanks. I really had no choice but to help you. This man dared to incite violence between our two clans, and thus deserved to die!” Smiling, Meng Hao clasped hands and bowed to the members of the Ji Clan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1192\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1194\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1193","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
