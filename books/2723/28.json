Susannah had gone back and bought it for me. It was so like her to do that. Later, my mother must have seen it hanging up in my closet, but she never said anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding there in the foyer, listening, I felt like the spy Steven was always accusing me of being. But I couldn\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Susannah say, \"Laurel, I\u0027m a big girl now. I need you to stop trying to manage my life. I\u0027m the one who gets to decide how I want to live it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t wait for my mother\u0027s response. I walked right in and said, \"What\u0027s going on?\" I looked at my mother when I said it, and I knew I sounded like I was blaming her, but I didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Everything\u0027s fine,\" my mother said, but her eyes looked red and tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why were you fighting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t fighting, hon,\" Susannah assured me. She reached out and smoothed my shoulder, like she was ironing out wrinkled silk. \"Everything really is fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t sound like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is,\" Susannah told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise?\" I asked. I wanted to believe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise,\" she said without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother walked away from us, and I could see from the stiffness of her shoulders that everything was not fine, that she was still upset. But because I wanted to stay with Susannah, where everything really was fine, I didn\u0027t follow her. My mother was the kind of person who would rather be alone anyway. Just ask my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter with her?\" I whispered to Susannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing. Tell me about your date with Cam,\" she said, leading me to the wicker couch in the sunroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have kept pressing her, should have tried to figure out what had really happened between the two of them, but my worry was already fading away. I wanted to tell her everything about Cam, everything. Susannah had that way about her, where you wanted to tell her all your secrets and everything in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat on the couch and patted her lap. I sat down next to her and put my head in her lap and she smoothed my hair away from my forehead. Everything felt safe and cozy, like that fight hadn\u0027t happened. And maybe it hadn\u0027t even been a fight, maybe I\u0027d misread the whole thing. \"Well, he\u0027s different from anyone I\u0027ve ever met,\" I began. \"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just so smart, and he doesn\u0027t care what people think. And he\u0027s so good-looking. I can\u0027t even believe he pays me any attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah shook her head. \"Oh, please. Of course he should pay you attention. You\u0027re so lovely, darling. You\u0027ve really blossomed this summer. People can\u0027t help but pay you attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha,\" I said, but I felt flattered. She was so good at making people feel special. \"I\u0027m glad I have you to talk to about this kind of stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am too. But you know, you could talk to your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wouldn\u0027t be interested in any of it, not really. She\u0027d pretend to care, but she wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Belly. That\u0027s not true. She would care. She does care.\" Susannah cradled my face in her hands. \"Your mother is your biggest fan, next to me. She cares about everything you do. Don\u0027t shut her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to talk about my mother anymore. I wanted to talk about Cam. \"You\u0027ll never believe what Cam said to me tonight,\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter twenty - six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, July turned into August. I guessed summer went by a lot faster when you had someone to spend it with. For me, that someone was Cam. Cam Cameron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher always came the first week of August. He\u0027d bring Susannah\u0027s favorites from the city, almond croissants and lavender chocolates. And flowers, he always brought flowers. Susannah loved flowers. She said she needed them like air, to breathe. She had more vases than I could count, tall ones and fat ones and glass ones. They were all over the house, flowers in vases in every room. Her favorites were peonies. She kept them on her nightstand in her bedroom, so they were the first thing she saw in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShells, too. She loved shells. She kept them in hurricane glasses. When she\u0027d come back from a walk on the beach, she\u0027d always come back with a handful of shells. She\u0027d arrange them on the kitchen table, admire them first, say things like, \"Doesn\u0027t this one look just like an ear?\" Or, \"Isn\u0027t this one the perfect shade of pink?\" Then she\u0027d put them in order from biggest to smallest. It was one of her rituals, something I loved to watch her do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat week, right around when Mr. Fisher usually came, Susannah mentioned that he couldn\u0027t get away from work. There had been some sort of emergency at the bank. It would just be the five of us finishing out the summer. It would be the first year without Mr. Fisher and my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she went to bed, early, Conrad said to me, conversationally, \"They\u0027re getting a divorce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents. It\u0027s about time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah glared at him. \"Shut up, Conrad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad shrugged. \"Why? You know it\u0027s true. Belly\u0027s not surprised, are you, Belly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was. I was really surprised. I said, to both of them, \"I thought they seemed like they were really in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever love was, I was sure they had it. I thought they had it a million times over. The way they gazed at each other at the dinner table, how excited Susannah got when he came to the summer house. I didn\u0027t think people like that got divorced. People like my parents got divorced. Not Susannah and Mr. Fisher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were in love,\" Jeremiah told me. \"I don\u0027t really know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad\u0027s a dick. That\u0027s what happened,\" Conrad said, getting up. He sounded so blas√© and matter-of-fact, but that didn\u0027t seem right. Not when I knew he adored his dad. I wondered if Mr. Fisher had a new girlfriend the way my father did. I wondered if he\u0027d cheated on Susannah. But who would ever cheat on Susannah? It was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell your mom you know,\" Jeremiah said suddenly. \"Mom doesn\u0027t know we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" I said. I wondered how they\u0027d found out. My parents had sat Steven and me down and told us everything, explained it all in detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Conrad left, Jeremiah said to me, \"Before we left, our dad had been sleeping in the guest room for weeks. He\u0027s already moved out most of his clothes. They think we\u0027re retarded or something, for us not to notice.\" His voice cracked at the last part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed his hand and squeezed it. He was really hurting. I guessed maybe Conrad was too, even if he didn\u0027t show it. It all made sense, when I thought about it. The way Conrad had been acting, so different, so lost. So un-Conrad-like. He was suffering. And then there was Susannah. The way she\u0027d been spending so much time in bed, the way she seemed so sad. She was hurting too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-28.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
