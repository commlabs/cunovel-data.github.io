The latter struggled briefly, but Lin Dong’s metal pincer like hands remained firm. Finally, she could only give up. Then, she gently gritted her teeth before she stared at the man in front of her.

This was the most respected place within the entire Great Yan Empire.

They were experts from the Tiger Devouring Army. Although Little Flame and the rest had returned to the Demon Region, they left a thousand Tiger Devouring Army troops behind to protect the Lin Clan. Therefore, with this force around, it was obvious that no one would dare to plot against the Lin Clan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, the Lin Clan enjoyed a high status within the Great Yan Empire. However, after Lin Xiao became the new tribe leader, he used some ruthless methods to clean up the clan. In fact, clansmen who abused the Lin Clan’s name and tarnished its reputation were the ones who were subjected to the harshest punishments. However, no one in the Lin Clan dared to object to Lin Xiao’s harsh methods. In fact, even those extremely experienced elders had no choice but to submit to him. This was because everyone clearly knew how the Lin Clan managed to obtain its current status...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Xiao’s efforts to clean up the clan were also quite effective. As such, the Lin Clan was no longer as arrogant as before. In fact, it was rare to hear of Lin Clan members who would take advantage of their clan’s reputation to misbehave. Therefore, this allowed the reputation of the Lin Clan within the Great Yan Empire to rise stealthily.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSuddenly, a few rays of light flashed across the horizon of the capital, before they streaked across the sky. In a couple of flashes, those rays of light had already entered the capital before they headed straight towards the Lin Clan. Meanwhile, the troops from the Tiger Devouring Army, who were guarding the Lin Clan, also detected this. However, the caution on their faces quickly disappeared. Instead, a heated and reverent expression took its place as they hurriedly knelt down on one knee.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMany members of the Lin Clan were startled when they saw this scene.

It has been many years since they met and her small face was no longer as immature looking as before. However, this only caused Liu Yan’s heart to ache.

However, if you dare to leave home without telling us in the future, I will get your big brother to punish you!” Lin Xiao snorted. However, his tensed face slowly relaxed. Then, he extended his large and rough hand, before he rubbed Qingtan’s small head and sighed, “But… it’s good that you are back. It’s good that you are back.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Father, mother, sorry. I’ve learnt my lesson.” Qingtan’s eyes reddened after she heard Lin Xiao sighing in relief. She had also been through a lot over the past few years. Therefore, she knew how precious and valuable the selfless pure love from Lin Xiao and Liu Yan were.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Lin Dong saw his parents sighing, he gently smiled.

Then, she suddenly spotted Ling Qingzhu, who was standing beside Lin Dong. Immediately, she was stunned. At this moment, the latter had already removed her veil and revealed her gorgeous face. Despite this, Liu Yan still managed to recognise her. Promptly, joy rose in her eyes as she quickly tugged Lin Xiao’s sleeve.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Xiao finally recovered after being reminded by her.

In the past, when she came to visit Lin Xiao and Liu Yan, she chose to do so as Lin Dong’s friend. Therefore, none of her visits were as ambiguous as this one. Moreover, there were so many members of the Lin Clan in her surroundings staring at her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Junior Ling Qingzhu greets the both of you.” Ling Qingzhu bowed slightly before she said in a soft and respectful manner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe was a lady that was so gorgeous that her looks could devastate an entire country and she had a cold demeanor.

In fact, some of them even resorted to climbing the large trees outside. After which, they were all staring in shock at that absolutely gorgeous lady. In fact, many of them were salivating.

However, her eyes were continuously sweeping over the latter’s body. Meanwhile, joy and satisfaction was present in her eyes, and she could not hide it no matter how much she tried to. Hence, under her gaze, the embarrassment within Ling Qingzhu’s eyes intensified. However, she could only brace herself and face Liu Yan head-on.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLiu Yan clearly liked Ling Qingzhu a lot. Moreover, she knew that the latter had a cold and indifferent character, and did not like to be the focus of attention. Therefore, Liu Yan quickly pulled her and Qingtan back into the house. After which, countless disgruntled cries sounded from around the courtyard. This caused Lin Dong to be slightly annoyed, as he promptly scanned the place with his sharp eyes. Immediately, many figures standing on the walls of the courtyard began to shrink backwards in a miserable fashion. Following which, howls sounded from around the courtyard.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1247\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1249\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1248","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM"}
