Ah, it makes a nice story, but it\u0027s hard to believe in it, isn\u0027t it now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This from a man who has no trouble with transubstantiation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s different,\" he protested. \"If the nuns had drilled reincarnation into my head I\u0027d believe that, too.\" He looked away. \"\u0027Twould be pleasant to believe I was the Big Fella once. But what a fucking comedown for himself, eh? To be Michael Collins in one lifetime, and to come back as Mick Ballou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"We were talking of guns before. Are you still carrying the same one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. He held out a hand and I gave it to him. He turned it over in his hand, lowered his head and sniffed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cleaned it since you fired it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and reloaded it. At least the cop who takes it off me won\u0027t know it\u0027s been fired recently. But I ought to get rid of it altogether.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ballistics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. They wouldn\u0027t make the match unless they looked for it, but they might look for it. I\u0027d have tossed it by now but I didn\u0027t want to walk around unarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you can\u0027t do that. But I can help you out.\" He opened the satchel he\u0027d brought from Grogan\u0027s, pulled out guns and set them on the desk. \"These automatics are good,\" he said. \"Or are you partial to revolvers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m used to. And don\u0027t automatics tend to jam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they say, but I\u0027ve never had it happen to me. Either of these would give you more firepower than what you\u0027ve been carrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if they\u0027d fit in the holster.\" I tried one, and it didn\u0027t. I put it back and picked up a revolver not unlike the one I\u0027d been using. It was another Smith, but chambered for magnum loads. I tried it in the holster and it was a perfect fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve no extra rounds for it,\" he said. \"There\u0027d be a box in the safe, and there they\u0027ll stay. Have you had a look at the old place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bar, you mean? Only on television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I drove past it. Sad to see it like that.\" He shook off the memory. \"I ought to be able to get hold of some shells to fit this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll buy a box tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, that\u0027s right. You\u0027ve a permit, they\u0027ll sell you whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they won\u0027t sell me a bazooka.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish they would. I\u0027d buy one, if I knew where to point it. It\u0027s hard to fight what you can\u0027t see. Take this, in the meantime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed me a little nickel-plated automatic that lay in the palm of his hand like a toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" he said. \"Put it in your pocket, it weighs next to nothing. There\u0027s only the clip that\u0027s in it, but it\u0027s not the sort of thing you\u0027d be likely to reload.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took it away from a man years ago, and I can tell you he\u0027ll have no further use for it. Go ahead, put it in your pocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two-Gun Scudder,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like one of our long nights at Grogan\u0027s, with the door locked and only the two of us left. There were people dead and the world going to hell around us, but for all that it was an easy night, or even an aisy one. The conversation flowed, and when it ran out from time to time there would be a long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you die,\" he said thoughtfully, \"\u0027tis said you see your whole life. But you don\u0027t see it minute by minute, like a speeded-up film. It\u0027s like everything you ever did in all your days was a brushstroke, and now you see the whole painting all at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. What a picture that would be! \u0027Twould be worse than the dying, to have to look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something I\u0027d forgotten. I was wondering what it was and thinking I ought to get on home when Mick said, \"So he was no help at all to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are we talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man you left for dead. Did you ever tell me his name? I can\u0027t recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chilton Purvis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, you told me. I remember now. He had nothing to tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They never told him a name, or gave him a number to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or if they did he wouldn\u0027t tell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d have told me anything at that point,\" I said. \"All he cared about was getting to the hospital. When I showed him the sketch, he ID\u0027d the thing before I got it unfolded. He\u0027d have sworn that was the guy who shot JFK if he thought that\u0027s what I wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mentioned a sketch,\" he said. \"Just before you told me that the boy was shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which was right around the time you stood up on the brake pedal and gave the guy behind us a heart attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aaah, he should learn how to fucking drive. But this sketch. You never said your man in Brooklyn saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that he really saw it. \u0027Yes, mon, that\u0027s him\u0027- but he barely looked at it. I showed him another sketch by the same artist, someone he couldn\u0027t possibly have seen, and yes, mon, that was him, too. Which one, I asked him. Both of them, he said. And anyone else I wanted to throw in the hopper, just so I hauled his ass to the ER.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s looked at another picture now,\" he said. \"His whole life laid out before him. He\u0027ll identify that straight enough. Do you have that sketch on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No harm if you don\u0027t. Next time\u0027ll do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it,\" I said, \"and I meant to show it to you hours ago. He\u0027s hired help, but my guess is he\u0027s a lot closer to the top man than Chilton Purvis or the Vietnamese. Maybe you\u0027ll know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out my wallet, found the sketch of the man who\u0027d hit me, showed it to him. It was well drawn, he observed. You got a real sense of the man. But it was no one he recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now the other one,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a face,\" I said. \"Somebody I thought I recognized, but couldn\u0027t place. I couldn\u0027t get the face out of my mind, so my artist friend drew it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the sketch and the color drained from his face. He looked at me and his green eyes were fierce. \"Is this a joke?\" he demanded. \"Is this a fucking joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen this man, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At Grogan\u0027s, the night we buried Kenny and McCartney. I just had a quick glimpse of him but he\u0027s got a memorable face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed he does. I\u0027ll never forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored the question. \"And you recognized him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looked familiar to me but I couldn\u0027t place him. TJ says he thinks he\u0027s seen him around the neighborhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And is that where you\u0027ve seen him? Around the neighborhood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I almost think…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That it\u0027s a face from the past. That I saw it years and years ago, if I ever saw it at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years and years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But who is he? You know him, obviously, but I never saw you react like that. It\u0027s almost as if…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if I\u0027d seen a ghost.\" He stuck out his finger, touched the sketch. \"And what do you think that is? What\u0027s that if it\u0027s not a ghost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve lost me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve lost it all,\" he said, \"for how am I to contend with a ghost? What chance have I against a man who\u0027s thirty years dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty years and more.\" He took the sheet of paper in both hands, brought it closer, held it at arm\u0027s length. \"Just the head,\" he said. \"All you\u0027d put in a drawing, isn\u0027t it? And it\u0027s how I saw him last, and how I see him in my mind. Just the head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw down the sketch, turned to me. \"Don\u0027t you see it, man? It\u0027s Paddy Fucking Farrelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old was he, this man you saw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Somewhere in his thirties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Farrelly\u0027s age when he died. I killed him, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I always understood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By God, I have to say he had it coming. He was a bad bastard, that one. I had my troubles with him in school days. A few years older than myself, and a bully he was, a terrible bully. That ended when I got my size and gave as good as I got. He didn\u0027t care for that, the dirty bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis a vast city, New York, but the old Kitchen\u0027s not so big, and the pool we swam in wasn\u0027t large at all. We were forever in each other\u0027s way, forever coming head to head with each other, and everybody knew how it had to end. By God, I thought, if someone\u0027s after getting killed it needn\u0027t be myself, and I laid for the bastard, and I did for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve heard the stories, and there\u0027s a mix of the true and the false in them. This much is true: I took his great ugly head off his shoulders. Do that, I thought, and your troubles with a man are at an end, for the best doctors in the world won\u0027t sew him together again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never thought to run a stake through his heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s figure this out,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a mystery,\" he said. \"If you\u0027d been brought up in the Church you\u0027d know that mysteries can\u0027t be figured out. They can only be contemplated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in an all-night diner he knew in Queens, way the hell out in Howard Beach not far from JFK. He\u0027d wanted to get away from McGinley \u0026amp; Caldecott, as if Paddy Farrelly\u0027s ghost had itself taken up residence there. I don\u0027t know how he managed to find the diner, or how he knew of it to begin with, but I figured we were safe there. The place was as remote as Montana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a man who\u0027d just seen a ghost he had a good appetite. He put away a big plate of bacon and eggs and home fries. I had the same, and it was good. I could probably be a vegetarian like Elaine, but only if bacon was declared a vegetable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mystery,\" I said. \"Well, I didn\u0027t have the advantage of a Catholic education. I think of a mystery as something to be solved. Can we agree that it\u0027s not a ghost I saw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s a resurrection,\" he said, \"and Paddy\u0027s an odd candidate for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it would have to be his son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he like the ladies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too well,\" he said. \"He\u0027d have his way with them if they liked it or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rape, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Words change their meaning,\" he said. \"Over time. When we were young it was scarcely rape if they knew each other. Unless it was a grown man with a child, or someone forcing himself upon a married woman. But if a girl was out with a man, well, what did she think she was getting into?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now they call it date rape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do,\" he said, \"and quite right. Well, if a girl was with Paddy, she ought to know what she was in for. There was one was going to press charges, but Paddy talked to her brother and her brother talked her out of it. No doubt he threatened to kill the whole family, and no doubt the brother believed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice fellow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I go to hell,\" he said, \"as I likely will, it won\u0027t be his blood on my hands that puts me there. But, you know, there were enough he didn\u0027t need to force. Some women are drawn to men like him, and the worse the man the greater the attraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-33.html","bookId":2332,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM"}
