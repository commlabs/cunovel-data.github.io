The weather had bowed down in honor of the occasion, and there was a slight cooling breeze. The night was neither too warm nor too cold, and the time had been carefully chosen; the sun was just setting in the western sky. The bride had longed for a castle, and they had found an ancient cathedral perched atop a hill within an old fortress town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe groom was gallantly trying to be everything the bride\u0027s fairytale prince should be. He had spent his adult life trying to live life by his own code, which demanded decency to his fellow human beings. He didn\u0027t bend easily to anyone\u0027s whim, but he had learned the importance of compromise, and of being compassionate. He knew himself capable of error and had learned to admit it. He could honestly say he was ready to battle for the downtrodden or the underdog, and he had lived through enough battles to see many of the errors made around him. More than anything, as he prepared to wed his stunningly bride, he could say that he loved her dearly, more than life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus...this wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever she longed for, a castle deep in a land foreign to him, an elegant horse-drawn carriage, or anything that could possibly complete the fantasy wedding of her heart, she could have. It helped that events had recently turned in his favor; where for many years he had worked to support what he prayed was a talent, he had suddenly discovered himself a rich man, almost overnight. And though the bride hailed from this part of the world, they had met in the United States. She had heard him playing; he had looked up and met her eyes. Life hadn\u0027t been the same from that moment on. But since many of their closest friends were still struggling financially, he and his bride had-very tactfully, they hoped-managed to treat their friends who couldn\u0027t afford the trip, providing an enjoyable respite from the rigors of life, as well as the pleasure of the wedding itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lavish runner extended the length of the cathedral aisle. The groom, elegant in a black tux, stood next to his identically attired groomsmen. As the music played and the priest cleared his throat, they all looked to the rear for the entry of the bride and her party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flower girl was adorable, tossing petals with a somber appreciation for the great duty entrusted to her. The bridesmaids followed, lovely in glimmering silver offset with black trim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the bride...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo beautiful...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair, long and lustrous, as red-gold as the sunset, fell to her shoulders, haloing her face in beauty. She wore a modern gown, but one designed in a Renaissance style, and his heart caught in his throat at the sight of her. Beneath the sheer flow of her veil, he could see her eyes shimmering, touched by a mist of tears. He smiled in return, and his heart thundered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved gracefully down the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spill of blood appeared on her dress, beginning as a tiny dot at her heart. Then it widened...widened to cover her breast, the entire bodice....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was horror on her face. Her eyes pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to run to her, but he couldn\u0027t reach her. A sound was rising in his ears. A storm, a siege, a rush...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood came then, like a tidal wave. A rush of it, as if a crimson river had exploded, broken a dam, surged down a hill...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her face her eyes...pleading for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the blood washed everywhere, along the aisle, up the ancient lichened walls of the cathedral. It rose higher and higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was drowning in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoking on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar away from the distant mountains, a man awoke from a nightmare. He let out a hoarse cry and jackknifed to a sitting position. The scene in his mind had played out so realistically that he was momentarily convinced he was covered in blood. He was coughing, as if he had been fighting for breath in his sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast off the sweat-soaked sheet that had covered him, rose, and strode to the doors to the balcony, quickly casting them open. Reality rushed in with a breath of magnolia-scented air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it never stop? Would the nightmare never cease to haunt him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the end of spring, the beginning of summer. Heat rose by day, and yet, by night, there was a breeze that touched his skin like a gentle hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the sky. Eerie clouds veiled the moon, giving it an unearthly tinge of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gritted his teeth, his features hard and determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked just as it had then....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the blood wedding. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-red/page-1.html","bookId":2266,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:29 PM"}
