{"id":29560,"no":30,"title":"XXX. ULYSSES MAKES HIS APPEARANCE.","content":"The day before that on which we were to return to Loches, Marc and I went on to one of the terraces which overlooked the road, to shoot our bows and arrows. All of a sudden Marc cried out, “Hollo! here’s Ulysses! what does he come for, I wonder?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ulysses was one of the gendarmes belonging to the brigade at Loches. I was leaning on the railing: Ulysses came up to us at a hard gallop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hollo! Ulysses, how d’ye do?” cried Marc.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ulysses raised his head, looked at us, and nodded. “Is your papa at home?” he asked Marc.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” answered Marc, “he is.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Off went the gendarme at a trot, and in another minute we saw him turn to the left and enter the great gate of the courtyard of Bois-Clair. When he turned to leave us I noticed that he carried a small yellow leather bag at his back. I watched it jumping up and down as the horse trotted. Ah! if I had only known what that little yellow bag contained!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fran?ois soon came out to tell us that luncheon was ready. When we entered the courtyard we saw the gendarme’s horse tied to one of the chestnut trees. The flies were tormenting him; he kept shaking his head, and giving tremendous kicks with his great iron-shod feet. As we passed him he was frightened, and started, making a tremendous clatter. Off I ran. As I passed the kitchen window, I saw Ulysses at table having dinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At luncheon Mr. and Mrs. Sublaine both seemed much pre-occupied; every now and then they spoke together in a low tone of voice. After luncheon Ulysses came into the room, and then Mr. Sublaine told him he should “start to-night instead of to-morrow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I looked at Marc with surprise, and I saw, by the expression of his face, that he was as much astonished as myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As we were leaving the dining-room Mrs. Sublaine told us to make our little arrangements in the way of packing, and so on, for that we were going to leave Bois-Clair that evening. She did not tell us why, but returned to talk to Mr. Sublaine. We were back again at Loches at eight o’clock that night.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1958/56177.html","bookId":746,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:40:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:40:01 AM"}
