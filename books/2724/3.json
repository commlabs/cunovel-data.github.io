But with my brother around it was pretty much impossible. Conrad and I would be watching TV, and Steven would plop right down between us. He’d talk to Conrad about stuff I didn’t know or care about, like football. One time, after dinner, I asked Conrad if he wanted to go get frozen custard at Brusters, and Steven chimed right in and said, “Sounds good to me.” I glared at him, but he just grinned back at me. And then Conrad took my hand, right in front of Steven, and he said, “Let’s all go.” So we all went, my mother too. I couldn’t believe I was going on dates with my mother and my brother in the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut really, it all just made that one amazing night in December all the sweeter. Conrad and I went back to Cousins, just the two of us. Perfect nights come so rarely, but that one was. Perfect, I mean. It was the kind of night worth waiting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m glad we had that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause by May, it was all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Marcy’s house early. I told Taylor it was so I could rest up for Justin’s party that night. It was partly true. I did want to rest, but I didn’t care about the party. As soon as I got home, I put on my big Cousins T-shirt, filled a water bottle with grape soda and crushed ice, and I watched TV until my head hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was peacefully, blissfully silent. Just the sounds of the TV and the air conditioning kicking off and on. I had the house to myself. Steven had a summer job at Best Buy. He was saving up for a fifty-inch flat screen he’d take to college with him in the fall. My mother was home, but she spent all day locked away in her office, catching up on work, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood. If I were her, I’d want to be alone too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor came over around six, armed with her hot pink Victoria’s Secret makeup bag. She walked into the living room and saw me lying on the couch in my Cousins T-shirt and frowned. “Belly, you haven’t even showered yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I took a shower this morning,” I said, not getting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, and you laid out in the sun all day.” She grabbed my arms and I let her lift me into a sitting position. “Hurry up and get into the shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her upstairs and she went to my bedroom while I went to the hall bathroom. I took the fastest shower of my life. Left to her own devices, Taylor was a big snoop and would poke around my room like it was hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came out Taylor was sitting on my floor in front of my mirror. Briskly, she blended bronzer onto her cheeks. “Want me to do your makeup too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No thanks,” I told her. “Close your eyes while I put on my clothes, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes and then closed them. “Belly, you’re such a prude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care if I am,” I said, putting on my underwear and my bra. Then I put my Cousins T-shirt on again. “Okay, you can look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor opened her eyes up superwide and she applied her mascara. “I could do your nails,” she offered. “I have three new colors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, there’s no point.” I held up my hands. My nails were bitten down to the quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor grimaced. “Well, what are you wearing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This,” I said, hiding my smile. I pointed down at my Cousins T-shirt. I’d worn it so many times it had tiny holes around the neck and it was soft as a blankie. I wished I could wear it to the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very funny,” she said, shimmying over to my closet on her knees. She stood up and started rifling around, pushing hangers over to the side, like she didn’t already know every article of clothing I owned by heart. Usually I didn’t mind, but today I felt sort of itchy and bothered by everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her, “Don’t worry about it. I’m just going to wear my cutoffs and a tank top.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Belly, people get dressed up for Justin’s parties. You’ve never been so you wouldn’t know, but you can’t just wear your old cutoffs.” Taylor pulled out my white sundress. The last time I’d worn it had been last summer, at that party with Cam. Susannah had told me the dress set me off like a picture frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and took the dress from Taylor and put it back into my closet. “That’s stained,” I said. “I’ll find something else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor sat back down in front of the mirror and said, “Well, then wear that black dress with the little flowers. It makes your boobs look amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s uncomfortable; it’s too tight,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, I took it off the hanger and put it on. Sometimes it was easier to just give in with Taylor. We’d been friends, best friends, since we were little kids. We’d been best friends so long it was more like a habit, the kind of thing you didn’t really have a say in anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See, that looks hot.” She came over and zipped me up. “Now, let’s talk about our plan of action.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What plan of action?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you and Cory Wheeler should make out at the party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taylor—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her hand. “Just hear me out. Cory’s supernice and he’s supercute. If he worked on his body and got a little definition, he could be, like, Abercrombie hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he’s at least as cute as C-word.” She never called him by his name anymore. Now he was just “you-know-who,” or “C-word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taylor, quit pushing me. I can’t be over him just because you want me to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t you at least try?” she wheedled. “Cory could be your rebound. He wouldn’t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you bring up Cory one more time, I’m not going to the party,” I told her, and I meant it. In fact, I kind of hoped she would bring him up again so I’d have an excuse not to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. “Okay, okay. Sorry. My lips are sealed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she grabbed her makeup bag and sat down on the edge of my bed, and I sat down at her feet. She pulled out a comb and sectioned off my hair. She braided quickly, with fast and sure fingers, and when she was done, she pinned the braid over the crown of my head, to the side. Neither of us spoke while she worked until she said, “I love your hair like this. You look sort of Native American, like a Cherokee princess or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to laugh, but then I stopped myself. Taylor caught my eye in the mirror and said, “It’s okay to laugh, you know. It’s okay for you to have fun.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-3.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
