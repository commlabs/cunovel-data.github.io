She was here, regrets like hounds at her heels .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder pounded; lightning flashed and sent jagged fissures of argent light splitting the black clouds. Somewhere behind her a strike detonated on the road and her horse stumbled. She steadied it with a firm rein. The gusts of wind felt like fists pummelling the left side of her face, and all down that side of her body. She swore, but could barely hear her own voice .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness had swallowed the world now and she rode half blind, trusting her mount to stay on the road. And still the rain held back – she could taste it on the air, bitter with the salt whipped up from the seas beyond the ridge .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cloak pulled loose from the thigh strings and snapped out wild as a torn sail behind her. She shouted a curse as she was nearly yanked from the saddle. Teeth grinding, she forced her upper body forward once again, one hand holding tight on the hinged saddle horn .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d ridden into the face of sandstorms – gods, she’d damned near spat into the face of the Whirlwind itself – but nothing like this. The air crackled, groaned. The road shook to the thunderous reverberations, like the hoofs of a god descending .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowling now, giving voice to her fury, she drove her horse into a churning gallop, and the beast’s breaths snorted like drums in the rain – but the air was charnel hot, tomb-dry – another blinding flash, another deafening detonation – her horse wavered and then, muscles bunching, bones straining, it regained its purchase on the road –\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– and someone was now riding beside her, on a huge, gaunt horse black as the sky overhead .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted round to glare at him . ‘ This is you? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of a grin, and then , ‘ Sorry! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ When will it end? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ How should I know? When the damned gate closes! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then added something more, but thunder smashed to splinters whatever he’d said, and she shook her head at him .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned closer, shouted , ‘ It’s good to see you again! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ You idiot! Does he even know you’re here? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to that question, his only answer was another grin .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had he been? The man had ever infuriated her. And now here he was, at her side, reminding her of all the reasons she’d had the first time round for doing … for doing what she did. Growling another curse, she shot him a glare . ‘ Will this get any worse? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Only when we leave! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods below, the things I’ll do for love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘North,’ the withered hag had said, her bent and broken visage reminding Torrent of an uncle who’d taken a hoof to the side of his face, crushing jaws and cheekbone. For the rest of his days, he’d shown to the world the imprint of that hoof, and with a twisted, toothless grin, he’d laugh and say, ‘ My best friend did this. What’s the world come to when you can’t even trust your best friends? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if the horse had outlived him, if his wife had not wept at his byre as a widow should, instead standing dry-eyed and expressionless, if he’d not begun chasing little girls … Torrent shook his head. Any rider who called his horse his best friend already had a few stones knocked loose in his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all that, Torrent found himself tending to his mount with a care bordering on obsession. And he grieved to see it suffer. Poor forage, not enough water, the absence of its own kind. Solitude weakened a horse’s spirit, for they were herd animals as much as humans were, and loneliness dulled the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The desert glitters with death,’ continued Olar Ethil. ‘We must go round it. North.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent glanced over at the children. Absi had ventured a few strides on to the plain, returning with a shard of crystal that painted prisms up his bared arm. He held up his trophy, waved it back and forth as if it was a sword, and then he laughed. The twins looked on, their wan faces empty of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no skills when it came to children. Redmask had set him to care for the Awl children, that day long ago, knowing well his awkwardness, his discomfort. Redmask had been punishing him for something – Torrent could no longer remember what, not that it mattered any more. From where he had been, he’d seen the fall of the great leader. From where he had been, he’d witnessed the death of Toc Anaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a measure of human madness, he realized, that children should be made to see such things. The pain of the dying, the violence of the slayer, the cruelty of the victor. He wondered what the twins had seen, since that night of betrayal. Even Absi must bear scars, though he seemed oddly immune to long bouts of sorrow. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-119.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
