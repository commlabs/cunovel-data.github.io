He felt even more stupid and washed out than usual. It was always like that. His emotions surged up in an enormous wave, curving and rearing, higher and higher, until it seemed as though the wave must carry everything before it. But the crash never came. Something always happened at the very top of the crest and the wave collapsed to run back like water down a drain, leaving, at the most, only the refuse of feeling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt took him a long time to get all his clothing on. He stopped to rest after each garment with a desperation far out of proportion to the effort involved.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to eat in the house and he had to go down to Hollywood Boulevard for food. He thought of waiting until morning, but then, although he was not hungry, decided against waiting. It was only eight o’clock and the trip would kill some time. If he just sat around, the temptation to go to sleep again would become irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe night was warm and very still. He started down hill, walking on the outer edge of the pavement. He hurried between lamp-posts, where the shadows were heaviest, and came to a full stop for a moment at every circle of light. By the time he reached the boulevard, he was fighting the desire to run. He stopped for several minutes on the corner to get his bearings. As he stood there, poised for flight, his fear made him seem almost graceful.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen several other people passed without paying any attention to him, he quieted down. He adjusted the collar of his coat and prepared to cross the street. Before he could take two steps someone called to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you, mister.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beggar who had spotted him from the shadow of a doorway. With the infallible instinct of his kind, he knew that Homer would be easy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Can you spare a nickel?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Homer said without conviction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe beggar laughed and repeated his question, threateningly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“A nickel, mister!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe poked his hand into Homer’s face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHomer fumbled in his change pocket and dropped several coins on the sidewalk. While the man scrambled for them, he made his escape across the street.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe SunGold Market into which he turned was a large, brilliantly lit place. All the fixtures were chromium and the floors and walls were lined with white tile. Colored spotlights played on the showcases and counters, heightening the natural hues of the different foods. The oranges were bathed in red, the lemons in yellow, the fish in pale green, the steaks in rose and the eggs in ivory.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHomer went directly to the canned goods department and bought a can of mushroom soup and another of sardines. These and a half a pound of soda crackers would be enough for his supper.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOut on the street again with his parcel, he started to walk home. When he reached the corner that led to Pinyon Canyon and saw how steep and black the hill looked, he turned back along the lighted boulevard. He thought of waiting until someone else started up the hill, but finally took a taxicab.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/714/1165.html","bookId":273,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:23:00 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:23:00 AM"}
