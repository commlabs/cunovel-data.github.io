OUT OF THE DUNGEON.","content":"The furious Spaniard came in like some wild beast, fairly gnashing his teeth and snarling to himself in his rage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif had but a moment, but he was quick to think; he sprang back to his old position, slipping his feet into the iron ring and putting his hands behind him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Ignacio never noticed any difference, in fact he did not look at Clif until he had set down the lantern and shut the heavy door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned the key again and then faced about; touching low and muttering to himself, he stole swiftly across the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And his gleaming eyes flashed into Clif\u0027s face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yankee!\" he hissed, \"I am back. Do you hear me? Ha, ha!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As if to make sure that he heard him he struck him once more across the face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Listen!\" he cried. \"Ha, ha!—and tremble.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif\u0027s blood rose at that blow, but he held himself back and watched and waited.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was a moment of peril for the treacherous Spaniard; what would have been his terror may be imagined, had he known the victim into whose eyes he was glaring was clutching in one hand a sharp knife, ready at any instant to plunge it into him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the fellow had no idea of his peril; he was at the very height of his triumph and his dark, beady eyes gleamed ferociously out of the shadows of that damp and silent vault.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he must have noticed that some of the color had come back into Clif\u0027s face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are still defiant,\" he cried. \"You still do not tremble. But wait—wait till you begin to feel what I have for you. Did you see those iron things I brought in? Ha, ha! There is one I will fasten about your forehead and draw it tight till your very brain bursts. And then will you like it? Hey? Will you turn pale then? Will you scream? Ha, ha!—and I shall dance around you and watch you. Will you be sorry you interfered with me then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ignacio might have taunted his victim that way for hours, but he was too eager and impatient. He whirled about and sprang toward the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Santa Maria!\" he panted. \"I will get it! I will begin! I must hear him yelling!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he snatched up something from the floor and taking the lantern in his other hand bounded back toward Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you ready?\" he exclaimed. \"Yankee pig, begin to scream!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he flashed the lantern\u0027s light upon him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was the crisis of the situation; for as the Spaniard looked he made the appalling discovery that his victim\u0027s feet were untied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he staggered back, dazed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Por dios!\" he gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And that exclamation was his last sound.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif had nerved himself for the spring; for he knew that Ignacio might have a revolver and that no risks could be taken.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But at that instant a dark, shadowy form rose up behind Ignacio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And one of his own iron instruments was raised above his head. It came down with a hissing sound, and then a heavy thud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Ignacio dropped without a groan, without even a quiver. He lay perfectly motionless. His villainy was at an end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif had sprung up as he saw that, and he gave a gasp of joy. Then he sprang toward his deliverer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shadowy stranger took no notice of him at first, but stooped and picked up the lantern, turning the light of it upon Ignacio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The villain\u0027s face was fixed in a look of horror; it made both Clif and the stranger shudder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The latter regarded it for a moment silently. The cadet could not see, but he was fingering a knife, as if undecided what to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who his mysterious deliverer was Clif had no idea. The single ray from the lantern did not furnish light enough for him to see anything; and the person had spoken but one word—\"Fight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the cadet\u0027s heart was full of gratitude; he sprang toward the stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who are you?\" he cried. \"I owe my life to you—let me thank you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the other motioned him back, and then for a few moments there was a silence, while both stared at Ignacio\u0027s silent form.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the stranger moved it was to point toward the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go,\" said he to Clif, in a low, whispering voice. \"Go; we will leave him here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that the mysterious person unlocked the great iron barrier and followed Clif out. The door clanged upon that ghastly scene, and Clif Faraday gave a sigh of relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yet there was so much before him that he soon forgot that hideous nightmare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For where was he going? And who was this stranger? And why had he rescued him? And what did he mean to do to Clif?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nothing could be learned in that dark corridor, for Clif could see no more there than inside of the room. But the stranger stumbled on and Clif followed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They came to an iron ladder, leading up to the floor above. Up that the man went, the cadet following; that took them to another long stone passage, dark as ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On they went, turning and winding about, but still not hesitating. And then suddenly the man halted in front of a grated door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The key was in the lock and the door opened promptly as he turned it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Enter,\" said he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif went in, and he heard the door shut behind him. It flashed over him then that he had only been taken to another cell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But when he whirled about he saw that the stranger had entered, too. The dark figure brushed past him and went across the room. A moment afterward Clif heard him in the act of striking a match.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then the light of a lamp lit up the little room. By it the eager cadet could see his rescuer, and he stared anxiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Further secrecy seemed not intended. The stranger faced about and each looked at the other steadfastly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What the mysterious man saw was a tall, handsome American in a blue uniform, his face rather pale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif in turn saw also a man in a blue uniform; he had to take but one glance to see that he was a lieutenant in the Spanish army.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was a tall, finely proportioned man, rather young, and with a slight dark mustache. He had the dark skin and the features of a Spaniard; but Clif thought he had never seen a finer looking military man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment Clif gazed at him in silence. Then he stepped toward him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell me, sir,\" he said. \"Why have you done this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The officer answered in a low, quiet voice:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will soon know,\" said he. \"Do not be impatient.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have saved me from a horrible fate,\" said the cadet, his voice choking. \"I do not know how to thank you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do not try,\" answered the other. \"You have some one else to thank.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then he became silent again, watching Clif. He seemed to be very much interested in him, from the way he studied the American\u0027s face. And once he gave a slight sigh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif looked at him in surprise; but the man turned away, and he went toward the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will return soon,\" said he, again in that quiet, firm voice. \"Wait here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing for Clif to do but wait; for when the door shut he was locked in the cell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That man\u0027s action was a mysterious one indeed. It left the cadet plenty to think of. He saw now where he got the keys. He was evidently one of the officers in charge of the castle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But why had he done it? Clif was utterly baffled before that question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it was not for very long; he soon learned, and in a startling and unexpected way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif had not noticed it, but there was another door to that cell. It was behind him, leading to a small room in the rear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While he stood there motionless and lost in thought waiting for the Spaniard\u0027s return, that door was silently opened, and a figure stood watching him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then suddenly it stepped out and came across the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cadet heard it then, and whirled about. He took one glance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then he staggered back with a cry of consternation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was Bessie Stuart!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For one instant the two stood and stared at each other as if to make sure that their eyes did not deceive them. And then, with a cry of delight that came from his very soul, Clif sprang toward the girl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bessie Stuart looked as if she had been through some terrible ordeal, for her face was pale; the emotion of meeting Clif almost overcame her, and she burst into tears upon his shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif himself was so dazed that he hardly knew what to think. He caught the girl in his arms to keep her from falling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bessie,\" he cried, \"how on earth did you get here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cadet\u0027s brain was in a whirl at that moment. He began to see what the Spaniard meant when he said it was for some other person\u0027s sake that he had rescued Clif. It was for her sake!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And it must have been by some terrible sacrifice that she had saved him from the torture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bessie!\" he cried. \"Tell me—that officer. What——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl looked up through her tears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"S-sh!\" she exclaimed. \"It is all right. Wait.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And at that instant Clif heard a key turn in the door, and knew that it was the man returning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif gazed into the girl\u0027s face and he saw a look of joy upon it that partially reassured him; then he looked up and saw that the Spanish lieutenant had entered and was watching them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In his quiet way he studied the faces of the two; he saw the look of happiness on Bessie Stuart\u0027s face, and he must have known that it was because she had met the cadet again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif saw him press his lips together resolutely. The cadet was watching him with the intensest anxiety, for he hoped in that man\u0027s actions to read the meaning of this mystery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the Spaniard\u0027s handsome face showed little emotion, though his chest heaved and fell as he stood there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then suddenly he stepped forward toward the two.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have brought it, Miss Stuart,\" he said, with a dignified bow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He held out a heavy cloth cape, which the girl flung over her shoulders; then, leaning on Clif\u0027s arm, she stepped toward the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am ready,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And without another word the officer turned and led the way out of the cell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shut the door and locked it behind him and then went on down the corridor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif was mystified beyond expression, but he asked no questions. The three went on silently. Bessie Stuart was so weak that she had to be half carried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They had gone but a short way down the long passage before they met a sentry with a gun upon his shoulder; he glanced at them inquiringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the lieutenant was not one who could be asked for explanations, and the soldier saluted and passed on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They passed through two heavily grated doors, each guarded in a similar way. But still not a word was spoken.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then suddenly Clif saw the passage broaden out into a wide hall, and a moment later he came to what he knew to be the great door by which he had first entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were two men standing on guard there, either sentries or jailers. Clif could not see which. The party came to a halt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Garcia,\" said the lieutenant, \"these are two prisoners, Americans, whom I have been directed to take across the bay.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man saluted and bowed respectfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you the order?\" he inquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have not. The commander had no time to give one to me. There is some hurry in the matter, I believe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is somewhat irregular, lieutenant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will assume full responsibility,\" said the other, quietly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man scanned the two prisoners closely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They are not even bound,\" he objected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will assume full responsibility,\" said the officer again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He spoke rather sharply; and without another word the man hastened to swing back the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the three stepped out of that black prison into the open air and under the broad sky of heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the lieutenant turned toward the two Americans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are free,\" he said, quietly. \"Fly for your lives!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3248/89013.html","bookId":606,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM"}
