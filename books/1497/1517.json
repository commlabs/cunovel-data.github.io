The two fire arrays appeared like two extremely huge fire plates that covered this realm from above and below. Xiao Yan’s group appeared like ants within these two enormous plates. They seemed insignificant at a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He actually… is able to control the great array placed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Hun Mo’s eyes were filled with disbelief when he saw this unexpected change. He suddenly recovered a moment later and hurriedly threw his eyes to the slowly rotating spatial tunnel some distance away. That was the path that led back to the Central Plains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quick, retreat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Hun Mo involuntarily cried out as his eyes flashed. His body took the lead to rush toward the spatial tunnel. This large array had been created by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. Even though that ultimate expert, whom even the clan head of the Hun clan admitted he was no match for, still wielded a mighty reputation that was deeply imprinted into the ears of those who had heard about what he had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief of the Hall of Souls group hesitated for a moment after seeing Old Man Hun Mo’s flee. However, they could only clench their teeth and follow him with great unwillingness. Someone as strong as Old Man Hun Mo had turned into this homeless stray. From the looks of it, this large array was extremely terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Hun Mo decision to flee undoubtedly caused many to panic. The other Elders from the ancient clans expressions greatly changed. All of them briefly hesitated before clenching their teeth and following him. Although the temptation of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was unimaginable, one needed to be alive to enjoy it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXun Er and the others watched these people flee. They frowned and quickly swung their heads to Xiao Yan, but Xiao Yan was standing there holding his head as some pain vaguely surfaced on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yam ge-ge, what has happened” Xun Er’s faced changed after seeing Xiao Yan’s face. She hurriedly cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should also leave!” Xiao Yan clenched his teeth. His mind churned, causing his soul to repeatedly emit a giddiness. Although he did not understand how these large arrays were built, he was able to sense an annihilation force from the fluctuations present. If that force were to spread, everyone present would immediately turn into dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, it is too late to try and leave now. I will refine everyone here to be my fire slaves!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s words had only just left his mouth when the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame in the sky a hundred thousand feet above wildly laughed. His finger gently pressed down on the spatial tunnel and a cream-white magma pillar shot out of the huge array below. The magma struck the tunnel with a lightning-like momentum, shattering it into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Hun Mo appeared in front of the collapsed spatial tunnel. His expression was gloomy. This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was not intending on letting any of them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should we do?” The chief of the Hall of Souls and his group hurried over. He frowned and asked a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How should I know? This demonic flame realm was built by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. He is said to be an existence which was closest to a Dou Di during that era. No one currently on the continent would be able to forcefully charge into the realm he created without passing through this tunnel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me that we should simply wait and die?” The deputy chief of the Hall of Souls grit his teeth and demanded an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will not be easy to kill us.” Old Man Hun Mo coldly laughed. His eyes quickly landed on the ancestor of the Pill Tower as he cried out in a deep voice, “Why don’t we cooperate? Currently, he is in control of the Refining Sky Ancient Formation. Even you will not be a match for him in a one-on-one fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Refining Sky Ancient Formation is divided into the sky and the earth. I will deal with the sky array. The earth array will be left to you!” The ancestor of the Pill Tower did not have time to argue with Old Man Hun Mo, who had rapidly changed his stance because of the situation. He immediately stated in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Chen, little Ancient Void Dragon girl, Gu Nanhai, you will all attack with me and deal with the sky array!” The ancestor of the Hall of Souls turned his head, looked at Xiao Chen’s group, and softly cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was little time to consider too much at this moment. The spatial tunnel had been removed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. If they did not join hands to fight, all of them would be refined into the fire slaves of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Immediately, the group nodded. Their bodies moved and appeared beside the ancestor of the Pill Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Hun Mo was also trying to get some experts from other factions, who had reached the fourth star of the Dou Sheng class, to join him while the ancestor of the Pill Tower was gathering helpers. Although these people were not really fond of Old Man Hun Mo, they could not care about much at this moment. Their lives were at stake…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An inconsequential effort. Although I really hate that fellow, do you really think that I would have remain trapped in this place for thousands of years if the formation he had placed could be broken by you weaklings?” The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame coldly laughed after the Pill Tower ancestor and the others gathered together. A murderous intent surged within his eyes. He was too lazy to say anything more. With a change of his hand seal, those large formations, which covered the sky and the earth, rumbled and slowly rotated like disks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy of the realm quickly became extremely wild and violent as both large formations slowly rotated. Some of the experts whose strength had reached the Ban Sheng class immediately paled. There were even some who ended up spitting up a mouthful of fresh blood. These large arrays had yet to unleash any attacks, but some were unable to endure any longer. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint really lived up to his reputation…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Refining Sky Ancient Formation, refine the sky into slaves!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame floated in the sky, as cream-white flame surged out of his body in all directions and then poured into the large arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cry sounded and the realm violently trembled. A circular cream-white light circle swiftly gathered from the edges of the large arrays. Finally, it gathered into a thousand-foot-large cream-white pillar in front of many shocked eyes. The interior of the light pillar was filled with a destructive energy…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Refine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame revealed a dense expression on his face. He suddenly pointed his finger down. Both the sky and the earth arrays violently shook before two cream-white light pillars shot out like fountains. The targets of the light pillars were the ancestor from the Pill Tower and Old Man Hun Mo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attack together!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs this incomparably ferocious attack came closer, even someone as strong as the ancestor from the Pill Tower displayed an extremely grave expression. A low cry sounded as a drop of half-green and half-golden blood shot out from his finger. In the blink of an eye, it grew to a couple of thousand feet in size. A shocking energy fluctuation along with a dense pill fragrance spread from it. Xiao Chen and the others by the side also unleashed their powerful Dou Qi while adopting grave faces. Their Dou Qi followed close behind that blood light cluster as they headed toward the cream-colored light descending from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Hun Mo and the others below also unleashed all of their abilities. They combined their strength and ruthlessly charged toward the light pillar that was rushing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collision merely lasted for an instant. An earth-shaking explosion spread across the realm. That magma sea region below had formed a deep pit that was millions of feet in size. The magma inside had been pushed back hundreds of feet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, what stubborn resistance. Refine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame flickered as he stood in the sky. He appeared to be in a somewhat crazy state. Both of his hands pressed down. The blood light cluster and Old Man Hun Mo’s group below, which were bitterly blocking the attack, emitted a bang. They were completely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the destruction of the obstructions, both light pillars began to fly through the sky with an extremely shocking speed. One chased after the ancestor of the Pill Tower and the other chased after Old Man Hun Mo before they suddenly colliding together in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the distant sky, the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame watched as a flame swiftly spread by millions of feet with its center being the point where the light pillars had clashed. He involuntarily laughed to the sky. Now, no one could stop him from escaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint, do you think that you can destroy me like this? I am a divine object and will naturally be protected by the world. Ha ha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was going somewhat crazy. He was finally going to escape after thousands of years of being sealed. How could he not be excited enough to lose himself…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this wild laughter did not continue for long before the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame gradually regained his calm. Suddenly, he lowered his head. His eyes were surprised as he scanned the point where the light pillars had crossed. He sensed a lot of auras present at that spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still alive? How is this possible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cream-white flame that lingered over the sky slowly paled. A faint light circle appeared in front of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s eyes after the flame disappeared. Xiao Yan was at the middle of this light circle. The ancestor of the Pill Tower, Old Man Hun Mo, and everyone else did not appear to have suffer any serious injuries despite appearing a little miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, not only was the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame stunned, even the ancestor of the Pill Tower and the others were in a daze as they looked at the light circle around them. This light circle might appear weak, but it was able to block an attack that could destroy a six star Dou Sheng…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone exchanged glances with each other. Clearly, none of them understood what had just occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan ge-ge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXun Er suddenly exclaimed while everyone was feeling lost. All pairs of eyes shifted, only to see that Xiao Yan seemed to have descended into an unconscious state. His body, however, was emitting a faint glow. This glow slowly gathered on the surface of his body. Finally, it turned into a somewhat illusionary human figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was greatly shocked when this human figure appeared because the appearance of this person was identical to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it is not the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame! It is the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancestor from the Pill Tower stared at the figure outside of Xiao Yan’s body with startled eyes. He suddenly seemed to have detected something and cried out in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone felt something exploded above their scalps after hearing these words. Why would this ultimate expert, who was rumored to have died thousands of years ago, suddenly appear on Xiao Yan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan, whose eyes were tightly shut, suddenly trembled while everyone was feeling shocked. Both of his eyes were slowly opened, but his dark-black eyes had turned cream-white. His eyes slowly roamed over the people present. Those people his eyes met would involuntarily feel a desire to worship him as a fluttering feeling materialized deep within their soul. Even an expert as strong as Old Man Hun Mo was no exception…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was an expert known as the closest to the Dou Di class back then. Who would have thought that he would appear again in this state!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1516\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1518\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1517","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM"}
