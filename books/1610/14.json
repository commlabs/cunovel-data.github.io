Kaby waved to one side and flicked a helpful hand and poor old Maud went where she\u0027d been going to send Kaby. It sickened me to see the gravity take hold and yank her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have jumped up and made it four in a row for Kaby, but I\u0027m not a bit brave when things like my life are at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLili was starting to get up, acting a little dazed. Kaby gently pushed her down again and quietly said, \"Where is it?\" and then hauled off and slapped her across the face. What got me was the matter-of- fact way Kaby did it. I can understand somebody getting mad and socking someone, or even deliberately working up a rage so as to be able to do something nasty, but this cold-blooded way turns my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLili looked as if half her face were about to start bleeding, but she didn\u0027t look dazed any more and her jaw set. Kaby grabbed Lili\u0027s pearl necklace and twisted it around her neck and it broke and the pearls went bouncing around like ping-pong balls, so Kaby yanked down Lili\u0027s gray silk bandeau until it was around the neck and tightened that. Lili started to choke through her tight-pressed lips. Erich, Mark and Illy had come up and crowded around, but they seemed to be content with the job Kaby was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, slut,\" she said, \"we have no time. You have a healing room in this place. I can work the things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it comes,\" I thought, wishing I could faint. On top of everything, on top of death even, they had to drag in the nightmare personally stylized for me, the horror with my name on it. I wasn\u0027t going to be allowed to blow up peacefully. They weren\u0027t satisfied with an A-bomb. They had to write my private hell into the script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a thing called an Invertor,\" Kaby said exactly as I\u0027d know she would, but as I didn\u0027t really hear it just then\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a mental split I\u0027ll explain in a moment. \"It opens you up so they can cure your insides without cutting you skin or making you bleed anywhere. It turns the big parts of you inside out, but not the blood tubes. All your skin\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;your eyes, ears, nose, toes, all of it\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;becoming the lining of a little hole that\u0027s half-filled with your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meantime, your insides are exposed for whatever the healer wants to do to them. You live for a while on the air inside the hole. First the healer gives you an air that makes you sleep, or you go mad in about fifty heartbeats. We\u0027ll see what ten heartbeats do to you without the sleepy air. Now will you talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t been listening to her, though, not the real me, or I\u0027d have gone mad without getting the treatment. I once heard Doc say your liver is more mysterious and farther away from you than the stars, because although you live with your liver all your life, you never see it or learn to point to it instinctively, and the thought of someone messing around with that intimate yet unknow part of you is just too awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I had to do something quick. Hell, at the first hint of Introversion, before Kaby had even named it, Illy winced so that his tentacles were all drawn up like fat feather-sausages. Erich had looked at him questioningly, but that lousy Looney had un-endeared himself to me by squeaking, \"Don\u0027t mind me, I\u0027m just sensitive. Get on with the girl. Make her tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I knew I had to do something, and here on the floor that meant thinking hard and in high gear about something else. The screwball sculpture Erich had tried to smash was a foot from my nose and I saw a faint trail of white stuff where it had skidded. I reached out and touched the trail; it was finely gritty, like powered glass. I tipped up the sculpture and the part on which it had skidded wasn\u0027t marred at all, not even dulled; the gray spheres were as glisteningly bright as ever. So I knew the trail was diamond dust rubbed off the diamonds in the floor by something even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat told me the sculpture was something special and maybe Doc had had a real idea in his pickled brain when he\u0027d been pushing the thing at all of us and trying to tell us something. He hadn\u0027t managed to say anything then, but he had earlier when he\u0027d been going to tell us what to do about the bomb, and maybe there was a connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted my memory hard and let it spring back and I got \"Inversh ... bosh ...\" Bosh, indeed! Bosh and inverse bosh to all boozers, Russki or otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I quick tried the memory trick again and this time I got \"glovsh\" and then I grasped and almost sneezed on diamond dust as I watched the pieces fit themselves together in my mind like a speeded-up movie reel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all hung on that black right-hand hussar\u0027s glove Lili had produced for Bruce. Only she couldn\u0027t have found it in Stores, because we\u0027d searched every fractional pigeonhole later on and there hadn\u0027t been any gloves there, not even the left-hand mate there would have been. Also, Bruce had had two left-hand gloves to start with, and we had been through the whole Place with a fine-tooth comb, and there had been only the two black gloves on the floor where Bruce had kicked them off the bar\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;those two and those two only, the left-hand glove he\u0027d brought from outside and the right-hand glove Lili had produced for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo a left-hand glove had disappeared\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the last I\u0027d seen of it, Lili had been putting it on her tray\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and a right-hand glove had appeared. Which could only add up to one thing: Lili had turned the left-hand glove into an identical right. She couldn\u0027t have done it by turning it inside out the ordinary way, because the lining was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I knew only too sickeningly well, there was an extraordinary way to turn things inside out, things like human beings. You merely had to put them on the Invertor in Surgery and flick it for full Inversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr you could flick it for partial Inversion and turn something into a perfect three-dimensional mirror image of itself, just what a right-hand glove is of a left. Rotation through the fourth dimension, the science boys call it; I\u0027ve heard of it being used in surgery on the highly asymmetric Martians, and even to give a socially impeccable right hand to a man who\u0027d lost one, by turning an amputated right arm into an amputated left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily, nothing but live things are ever Inverted in Surgery and you wouldn\u0027t think of doing it to an inanimate object, especially in a Place where the Doc\u0027s a drunk and the Surgery hasn\u0027t been used for hundreds of sleeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when you\u0027ve just fallen in love, you think of wonderful crazy things to do for people. Drunk will love, Lili had taken Bruce\u0027s extra left-hand glove into Surgery, partially Inverted it, and got a right-hand glove to give him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Doc had been trying to say with his \"Inversh ... bosh ...\" was \"Invert the box,\" meaning we should put the bronze chest through full Inversion to get at the bomb inside to disarm it. Doc too had got the idea from Lili\u0027s trick with the glove. What an inside-out tactical atomic bomb would look like, I could not imagine and did not particularly care to see. I might have to, though, I realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fast-motion film was still running in my head. Later on, Lili had decided like I had that her lover was going to lose out in his plea for mutiny unless she could give him a really captive audience\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and maybe, even then, she had been figuring on creating the nest for Bruce\u0027s chicks and ... all those other things we\u0027d believed in for a while. So she\u0027d taken the Major Maintainer and remembered the glove, and not many seconds later, she had set down on a shelf of the Art Gallery an object that no one would think of questioning\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;except someone who knew the Gallery by heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the abstract sculpture a foot from my nose, at the clustered gray spheres the size of golfballs. I had known that the inside of the Maintainer was made up of vastly tough, vastly hard giant molecules, but I hadn\u0027t realized they were quite that big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said to myself, \"Greta, this is going to give you a major psychosis, but you\u0027re the one who has to do it, because no one is going to listen to your deductions when they\u0027re all practically living on negative time already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up as quietly as if I were getting out of a bed I shouldn\u0027t have been in\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;there are some things Entertainers are good at\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and Kaby was just saying you go mad in about fifty heartbeats.\" Everybody on their feet was looking at Lili. Sid seemed to have moved, but I had no time for him except to hope he hadn\u0027t done anything that might attract attention to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out of my shoes and walked rapidly to Surgery\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;there\u0027s one good thing about this hardest floor anywhere, it doesn\u0027t creak. I walked through the Surgery screen that is like a wall of opaque, odorless cigarette smoke and I concentrated on remembering my snafued nurse\u0027s training, and before I had time to panic, I had the sculpture positioned on the gleaming table of the Invertor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze for a moment when I reached for the Inversion switch, thinking of the other time and trying to remember what it had been that bothered me so much about the inside-out brain being bigger and not having eyes, but when I either thumbed my nose at my nightmare or kissed my sanity good-by, I don\u0027t know which, and twisted the switch all the way over, and there was the Major Maintainer winking blue about three times a second as nice as you could want it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must have been working as sweet and steady as ever, all the time it was Inverted, except that, being inside out, it had hocused the direction finders. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-14.html","bookId":1610,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:29 PM"}
