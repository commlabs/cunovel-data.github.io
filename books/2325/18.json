But if he\u0027d hired somebody private back in the middle of July-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d have had an easier time of it. No argument.\" He thought for a moment. \"Say she left the machine behind herself, not by accident but because she had a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She moved out but she doesn\u0027t want somebody to know she\u0027s gone. Her parents, say, or somebody else she\u0027s trying to duck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d just keep the room. Pay the rent and live elsewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, say she wants to move out and skip town but she wants to be able to get her calls. She could-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She couldn\u0027t get her calls from a distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure she could. They\u0027ve got this gizmo, you just call your machine from any touch-tone phone and punch in a code and the machine plays back your messages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all machines have the remote-pickup feature. Hers didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that? Oh, right, you saw the machine, it\u0027s still in the room.\" He splayed his fingers. \"Look, what\u0027s the point going over this again and again? You were a cop long enough, Matt. Put yourself in my position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put yourself in my fucking position, will you? You\u0027re sitting at this desk and a guy comes in with a story about bed linen and a telephone answering machine. There\u0027s no evidence that a crime has been committed, the missing person is a mentally competent adult, and nobody\u0027s seen her for over two months. Now what am I supposed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you do? In my position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose it was the mayor\u0027s daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mayor doesn\u0027t have a daughter. The mayor never had a hard-on in his life, so how could he have a daughter?\" He pushed his chair back. \"Of course it\u0027s a different matter if it\u0027s the mayor\u0027s daughter. Then we put a hundred men on it and work around the clock until something breaks. Which doesn\u0027t mean something necessarily does, not after all this time and with so little to go on. Look, what\u0027s the big fear here? Not that she went to Disney World and the Ferris wheel got stuck with her at the top of it. What are you and her parents really afraid of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That she\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe she is. People die all the time in this city. If she\u0027s alive she\u0027ll call home sooner or later, when the money runs out or her head clears up, whatever it takes. If she\u0027s dead there\u0027s nothing anybody can do for her, you or me or anybody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m right. Your problem is you get like a dog with a bone. Call the father, tell him there\u0027s nothing to run with, he should have called you two months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, make him feel guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you could find a better way to put it. Jesus, you already gave it more than most people would and took it as far as it would go. You even dug up some decent clues, the phone calls and everything, the answering machine. The trouble is they\u0027re not attached to anything. You pull them and they come off in your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let go of it. You don\u0027t want to put in any more hours or you wind up working for chump change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to say something but his phone rang. He talked for a few minutes. When he hung up he said, \"What did we do for crime before we had cocaine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We made do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did we? I guess we must have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked around for a few hours. Around one-thirty it started raining lightly. Almost immediately the umbrella sellers turned up on the streetcorners. You\u0027d have thought they had existed previously in spore form, springing miraculously to life when a drop of water touched them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t buy an umbrella. It wasn\u0027t raining hard enough to make it worthwhile. I went into a bookstore and killed some time without buying anything, and when I left the rain still didn\u0027t amount to much more than a fine mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped at my hotel, checked at the desk. No messages, and the only mail was an offer of a credit card. \"You have already been approved!\" the copy blared. Somehow I doubted this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went upstairs and called Warren Hoeldtke. I had my notebook at hand, and I gave him a quick rundown on what lines of investigation I\u0027d pursued and what little I\u0027d managed to determine. \"I\u0027ve put in a lot of hours,\" I said, \"but I don\u0027t think I\u0027m much closer to her than I was when I started. I don\u0027t feel as though I\u0027ve accomplished anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want more money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I wouldn\u0027t know how to go about earning it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think has happened to her? I realize you don\u0027t have any hard knowledge, but don\u0027t you have some sense of what went on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a vague one, and I don\u0027t know how much weight to attach to it. I think she got mixed up with somebody who appeared exciting and turned out to be dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to say it, and I couldn\u0027t blame him. \"She may be alive,\" I said. \"Maybe she\u0027s out of the country. Maybe she\u0027s mixed up in something illegal. That might explain why she hasn\u0027t been able to get in touch with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to imagine Paula involved with criminals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it just looked like an adventure to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that\u0027s possible.\" He sighed. \"You don\u0027t leave much room for hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I wouldn\u0027t say you have grounds for despair yet, either. I\u0027m afraid all you can do is wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve done from the beginning. It\u0027sâ€¦ hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said. \"I want to thank you for your efforts, and for being straight with me. I\u0027ll be happy to send you more money if you think there\u0027s any point at all in putting in more time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll probably put in a few more days on this anyway, just on the chance that something\u0027ll loosen up. In which case you\u0027ll hear from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to take any more money from him,\" I told Willa. \"The original thousand had put me under more obligation than I wanted to be. If I accepted any more of his money I\u0027d have his daughter around my neck for the rest of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re doing more work. Why shouldn\u0027t you get paid for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got paid already, and what did I give him in return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did the work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I? In high school physics they taught us how to measure work. The formula was force times distance. Take an object that weighs twenty pounds, move it six feet, and you\u0027ve done a hundred and twenty foot-pounds worth of work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foot-pounds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the unit of measurement. But if you stood and pushed against a wall all day and didn\u0027t budge it, you hadn\u0027t performed any work. Because you\u0027d moved the wall a distance of zero, so it didn\u0027t matter how much the wall weighed, the product was zero. Warren Hoeldtke paid me a thousand dollars and all I did was push a wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You moved it a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough to matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"When Edison was working on the light bulb, somebody said he must be discouraged because he wasn\u0027t making any progress. Edison said he\u0027d made great progress, because now he knew twenty thousand materials that you couldn\u0027t use for a filament.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edison had a better attitude than I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a good thing, too, or we\u0027d all be in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in the dark, and seemed none the worse for it. We were in her bedroom, stretched out on her bed, a Reba McIntyre tape playing in the kitchen. Through the bedroom window you could hear the sounds of a quarrel in the building behind hers, loud voices arguing a point in Spanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t intended to drop in on her. I\u0027d gone out walking after my call to Hoeldtke. I was passing a florist and had the impulse to send her flowers, and after he\u0027d written up the order I found out he couldn\u0027t deliver until the following day. So I\u0027d delivered them myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the flowers in water and we sat in the kitchen with them on the table between us. She made coffee. It was instant, but it was a fresh jar of a premium brand and no killjoy had taken the caffeine out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, without needing to discuss the matter, we\u0027d moved to the bedroom. Reba McIntyre had been singing when we entered the bedroom and she was still hard at it, but we had heard some of the songs more than once. The tape reversed automatically, and would play over and over if you let it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while she said, \"Are you hungry? I could cook something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you feel like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I tell you a secret? I never feel like it. I\u0027m not a great cook, and you\u0027ve seen the kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could go out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pouring. Don\u0027t you hear it in the airshaft?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was raining very lightly earlier. What my Irish aunt used to call a soft day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it turned hard, from the sound of it. Suppose I order Chinese? They don\u0027t care what the weather\u0027s like, they hop on their kamikaze bicycles and ride through hailstorms if they have to. \u0027Neither rain nor snow nor heat nor gloom of night shall keep you from your moo goo gai pan.\u0027 Except I don\u0027t want moo goo gai pan. I want- would you like to know what I want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want sesame noodles and pork fried rice and chicken with cashews and shrimp with four flavors. How does that sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like enough food for an army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet we eat all of it. Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to have time? It\u0027s twenty to eight, and by the time they deliver and we eat it\u0027ll be time for your meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to go tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive. I have a question, though. What\u0027s shrimp with four flavors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never had shrimp with four flavors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my dear,\" she said. \"Are you ever in for a treat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate at the tin-topped table in the kitchen. I tried to move the flowers to give us more room but she wouldn\u0027t let me. \"I want them where I can see them,\" she said. \"There\u0027s plenty of room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had gone shopping that morning, and besides coffee she\u0027d stocked up on fruit juice and soft drinks. I had a Coke. She got out a bottle of Beck\u0027s for herself, but before she opened it she made sure it wouldn\u0027t bother me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because nothing goes with Chinese food like beer. Matt, is it all right to say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, that beer goes well with Chinese food? Well, it may be a controversial statement, and I suppose there are some wine growers somewhere who\u0027d give you an argument, but so what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your beer,\" I said. \"And sit down and eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was delicious, and the shrimp dish was the treat she\u0027d promised. They\u0027d included disposable chopsticks with our order and she used a pair. I had never learned to handle them and stuck with a fork. I told her she was good with the chopsticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easy,\" she said. \"It just takes practice. Here. Try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made an effort, but my fingers were clumsy. The sticks kept crossing and I couldn\u0027t get any food to my mouth. \"This would be good for someone on a diet,\" I said. \"You\u0027d think somewhere along the way they could have invented the fork. They invented everything else, pasta, ice cream, gunpowder.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-18.html","bookId":2325,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM"}
