{"id":28306,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII THE QUICKNESS OF THE HAND","content":"THERE WAS a moment\u0027s silence at the table. It was broken by the agitated voice of Meyer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here I say,\" he said anxiously. \"Don\u0027t include me in on this, Hugger.\" He knew it was a private bet with Bond, but he wanted to show Drax that he was thoroughly nervous about the whole affair. He saw himself making some ghastly mistake that would cost his partner a lot of money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous, Max,\" said Drax harshly. \"You play your hand. This is nothing to do with you. Just an enjoyable little bet with our rash friend here. Come along, come along. My deal, Admiral.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e M. cut the cards and the game began. Bond lit a cigarette with hands that had suddenly become quite steady. His mind was clear. He knew exactly what he had to do, and when, and he was glad that the moment of decision had come.\n\u003cbr\u003e He sat back in his chair and for a moment he had the impression that there was a crowd behind him at each elbow, and that faces were peering over his shoulder, waiting to see his cards. He somehow felt that the ghosts were friendly, that they approved of the rough justice that was about to be done.\n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled as he caught himself sending this company of dead gamblers a message, that they should see that all went well.\n\u003cbr\u003e The background noise of the famous gaming room broke in on his thoughts. He looked round. In the middle of the long room, under the central chandelier, there were several onlookers round the poker game. \u0027Raise you a hundred.\u0027 \u0027And a hundred.\u0027 \u0027And a hundred.\u0027 \u0027Damn you. I\u0027ll look\u0027, and a shout of triumph followed by a hubbub of comment. In the distance he could hear the rattle of a croupier\u0027s rake against the counters at the Shemmy game. Nearer at hand, at his end of the room, there were three other tables of bridge over which the smoke of cigars and cigarettes rose towards the barrelled ceiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e Nearly every night for more than a hundred and fifty years there had been just such a scene, he reflected, in this famous room. The same cries of victory and defeat, the same dedicated faces, the same smell of tobacco and drama. For Bond, who loved gambling, it was the most exciting spectacle in the world. He gave it a last glance to fix it all in his mind and then he turned back to his table.\n\u003cbr\u003e He picked up his cards and his eyes glittered. For once, on Drax\u0027s deal, he had a cast-iron game hand; seven spades with the four top honours, the ace of hearts, and the ace, king of diamonds. He looked at Drax. Had he and Meyer got the clubs? Even so Bond could overbid. Would Drax try and force him too high and risk a double? Bond waited.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No bid,\" said Drax, unable to keep the bitterness of his private knowledge of Bond\u0027s hand out of his voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Four spades,\" said Bond.\n\u003cbr\u003e No bid from Meyer; from M.; reluctantly from Drax.\n\u003cbr\u003e M. provided some help, and they made five.\n\u003cbr\u003e One hundred and fifty points below the line. A hundred above for honours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph,\" said a voice at Bond\u0027s elbow. He looked up. It was Basildon. His game had finished and he had strolled over to see what was happening on this separate battlefield.\n\u003cbr\u003e He picked up Bond\u0027s score-sheet and looked at it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That was a bit of a beetle-crusher,\" he said cheerfully. \"Seems you\u0027re holding the champions. What are the stakes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond left the answer to Drax. He was glad of the diversion. It could not have been better timed. Drax had cut the blue cards to him. He married the two halves and put the pack just in front of him, near the edge of the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fifteen and fifteen. On my left,\" said Drax.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond heard Basildon draw in his breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Chap seemed to want to gamble, so I accommodated him. Now he goes and gets all the cardsâ€¦\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Drax grumbled on.\n\u003cbr\u003e Across the table, M. saw a white handkerchief materialize in Bond\u0027s right hand. M.\u0027s eyes narrowed. Bond seemed to wipe his face with it. M. saw him glance sharply at Drax and Meyer, then the handkerchief was back in his pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e A blue pack was in Bond\u0027s hands and he had started to \u0027 deal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the hell of a stake,\" said Basildon. \"We once had a thousand-pound side-bet on a game of bridge. But that was in the rubber boom before the \u0027fourteen-eighteen war. Hope nobody\u0027s going to get hurt.\" He meant it. Very high stakes in a private game generally led to trouble. He walked round and stood between M. and Drax.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond completed the deal. With a touch of anxiety he picked up his cards.\n\u003cbr\u003e He had nothing but five clubs to the ace, queen, ten, and eight small diamonds to the queen.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was all right. The trap was set.\n\u003cbr\u003e He almost felt Drax stiffen as the big man thumbed through his cards, and then, unbelieving, thumbed them through again. Bond knew that Drax had an incredibly good hand. Ten certain tricks, the ace, king of diamonds, the four top honours in spades, the four top honours in hearts, and the king, knave, nine of clubs.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond had dealt them to him-in the Secretary\u0027s room before dinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond waited, wondering how Drax would react to the huge hand. He took an almost cruel interest in watching the greedy fish come to the lure.\n\u003cbr\u003e Drax exceeded his expectations.\n\u003cbr\u003e Casually he folded his hand and laid it on the table. Nonchalantly he took the flat carton out of his pocket, selected a cigarette and lit it. He didn\u0027t look at Bond. He glanced up at Basildon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" he said, continuing the conversation about their stakes. \"It\u0027s a high game, but not the highest I\u0027ve ever played. Once played for two thousand a rubber in Cairo. At the Mahomet Ali as a matter of fact. They\u0027ve really got guts there. Often bet on every trick as well as on the game and rubber. \"Now,\" he picked up his hand and looked slyly at Bond. \"I\u0027ve got some good tickets here. I\u0027ll admit it. But then you may have too, for all I know.\" (Unlikely, you old shark, thought Bond, with three of the ace-kings in your own \u0027 hand.) \"Care to have something extra just on this hand?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond made a show of studying his cards with the minuteness of someone who is nearly very drunk. \"I\u0027ve got a promising lot too,\" he said thickly. \"If my partner fits and the cards lie right I might make a lot of tricks myself. What are you suggesting?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sounds as if we\u0027re pretty evenly matched,\" lied Drax. \"What do you say to a hundred a trick on the side? From what you say it shouldn\u0027t be too painful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond looked thoughtful and rather fuddled. He took another careful look at his hand, running through the cards one by one. \"All right,\" he said. \"You\u0027re on. And frankly you\u0027ve made me gamble. You\u0027ve obviously got a big hand, so I must shut you out and chance it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond looked blearily across at M. \"Pay your losses on this one, partner,\" he said. \"Here we go. Er-seven clubs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e In the dead silence that followed, Basildon, who had seen Drax\u0027s hand, was so startled that he dropped his whisky and soda on the floor. He looked dazedly down at the broken glass and let it lie.\n\u003cbr\u003e Drax said \"What?\" in a startled voice and hastily ran through his cards again for reassurance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you say grand slam in clubs?\" he asked, looking curiously at his obviously drunken opponent, \"Well, it\u0027s your funeral. What do you say, Max?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No bid,\" said Meyer, feeling in the air the electricity of just that crisis he had hoped to avoid. Why the hell hadn\u0027t he gone home before this last rubber? He groaned inwardly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No bid,\" said M. apparently unperturbed. \"Double.\" The word came viciously out of Drax\u0027s mouth. He put down his hand and looked cruelly, scornfully at this tipsy oaf who had at last, inexplicably, fallen into his hands. \"That mean you double the side-bets too?\" asked Bond. \"Yes,\" said Drax greedily. \"Yes. That\u0027s what I meant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" said Bond. He paused. He looked at Drax and not at his hand. \"Redouble. The contract and the side-bets. ?400 a trick on the side.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e It was at that moment that the first hint of a dreadful, incredible doubt entered Drax\u0027s mind. But again he looked at his hand, and again he was reassured. At the very worst he couldn\u0027t fail to make two tricks.\n\u003cbr\u003e A muttered \"No bid\" from Meyer. A rather strangled \"No bid\" from M. An impatient shake of the head from Drax.\n\u003cbr\u003e Basildon stood, his face very pale, looking intently across the table at Bond.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he walked slowly round the table, scrutinizing all the hands. What he saw was this:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And suddenly Basildon understood. It was a laydown Grand Slam for Bond against any defence. Whatever Meyer led, Bond must get in with a trump in his own hand or on the table. Then, in between clearing trumps, finessing of course against Drax, he would play two rounds of diamonds, trumping them in dummy and catching Drax\u0027s ace and king in the process. After five plays he would be left with the remaining trumps and six winning diamonds. Drax\u0027s aces and kings would be totally valueless.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was sheer murder.\n\u003cbr\u003e Basildon, almost in a trance, continued round the table and stood between M. and Meyer so that he could watch Drax\u0027s face, and Bond\u0027s. His own face was impassive, but his hands, which he had stuffed into his trouser pockets so that they would not betray him, were sweating. He waited, almost fearfully, for the terrible punishment that Drax was about to receive-thirteen separate lashes whose scars no card-player would ever lose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come along, come along,\" said Drax impatiently. \"Lead something, Max. Can\u0027t be here all night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e You poor fool, thought Basildon. In ten minutes you\u0027ll wish that Meyer had died in his chair before he could pull out that first card.\n\u003cbr\u003e In fact, Meyer looked as if at any moment he might have a stroke. He was deathly pale, and the perspiration was dropping off his chin on to his shirt front. For all he knew, his first card might be a disaster.\n\u003cbr\u003e At last, reasoning that Bond might be void in his own long suits, spades and hearts, he led the knave of diamonds.\n\u003cbr\u003e It made no difference what he led, but when M.\u0027s hand went down showing chicane in diamonds, Drax snarled across at his partner. \"Haven\u0027t you got anything else, you dam\u0027 fool? Want to hand it to him on a plate? Whose side are you on, anyway?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Meyer cringed into his clothes. \"Best I could do, Hugger,\" he said miserably, wiping his face with his handkerchief.\n\u003cbr\u003e But by this time Drax had got his own worries.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond trumped on the table, catching Drax\u0027s king of diamonds, and promptly led a club. Drax put up his nine. Bond took it with his ten and led a diamond, trumping it on the table. Drax\u0027s ace fell. Another club from the table, catching Drax\u0027s knave.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then the ace of clubs.\n\u003cbr\u003e As Drax surrendered his king, for the first time he saw what\" might be happening. His eyes squinted anxiously at Bond, waiting fearfully for the next card. Had Bond got the diamonds? Hadn\u0027t Meyer got them guarded? After all, he had opened with them. Drax waited, his cards slippery with sweat.\n\u003cbr\u003e Morphy, the great chess player, had a terrible habit. He would never raise his eyes from the game until he knew his opponent could not escape defeat. Then he would slowly lift his great head and gaze curiously at the man across the board. His opponent would feel the gaze and would slowly, humbly raise his eyes to meet Morphy\u0027s. At that moment he would know that it was no good continuing the game. The eyes of Morphy said so. There was nothing left but surrender.\n\u003cbr\u003e Now, like Morphy, Bond lifted his head and looked straight into Drax\u0027s eyes. Then he slowly drew out the queen of diamonds and placed it on the table. Without waiting for Meyer to play he followed it, deliberately, with the 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and the two winning clubs.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he spoke. \"That\u0027s all, Drax,\" he said quietly, and sat slowly back in his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e Drax\u0027s first reaction was to lurch forward and tear Meyer\u0027s cards out of his hand. He faced them on the table, scrabbling feverishly among them for a possible winner.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he flung them back across the baize.\n\u003cbr\u003e His face was dead white, but his eyes blazed redly at Bond. Suddenly he raised one clenched fist and crashed it on the table among the pile of impotent aces and kings and queens in front of him.\n\u003cbr\u003e Very low, he spat the words at Bond. \"You\u0027re a cheâ€¦\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s enough, Drax.\" Basildon\u0027s voice came across the table like a whiplash. \"None of that talk here. I\u0027ve been watching the whole game. Settle up. If you\u0027ve got any complaints, put them in writing to the Committee.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Drax got slowly to his feet. He stood away from his chair and ran a hand through his wet red hair. The colour came slowly back into his face and with it an expression of cunning. He glanced down at Bond and there was in his good eye a contemptuous triumph which Bond found curiously disturbing.\n\u003cbr\u003e He turned to the table. \"Good night, gentlemen,\" he said, looking at each of them with the same oddly scornful expression. \"I owe about ?15,000. I will accept Meyer\u0027s addition.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e He leant forward and picked up his cigarette-case and lighter.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he looked again at Bond and spoke very quietly, the red moustache lifting slowly from the splayed upper teeth. \"I should spend the money quickly, Commander Bond,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he turned away from the table and walked swiftly out of the room.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46598.html","bookId":1274,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 11:23:53 PM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 11:23:53 PM"}
