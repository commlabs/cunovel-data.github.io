Says he\u0027s got the pregnant sim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Him and half a million others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca shook his head. How many times had he heard that since the fivemegabuck reward hit the news? People were crawling out of the woodwork with crazy stories, some wishful thinking, others outright lies. Meerm, or an equally pregnant sim, had been sighted in Chicago, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, London, Hong Kong. The world was suddenly full of pregnant sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Morales says he met you at the Newark crib when you came looking for the pregnant sim; says she\u0027s been hiding there right under his nose all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca remembered Morales now, a quick, jittery little ferret of a man. Remembered that damn crib too. After a weeklong fruitless vigil, he\u0027d yanked surveillance from the place, figuring if the pregnant sim hadn\u0027t returned by then, she wasn\u0027t coming back at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if she\u0027d never left the building in the first place...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put him though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca\u0027s hand darted toward the phone and hovered over the receiver. He let it ring twice before picking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, after listening to Morales\u0027s story, Luca hung up and jabbed the intercom button. \"Nowicki. Get Grimes and Alessi. Meet me in the garage. We\u0027re rolling!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was it. Morales\u0027s story hung together too well to be anything but the real thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve found her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca felt as if a magnum of Dom Perignom had popped open inside his chest.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-69.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
