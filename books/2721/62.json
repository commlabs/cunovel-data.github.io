The word never failed to take effect, but none tasted more unpleasant to her. Just six letters, and she felt small and weak and so ugly that people avoided looking at her. She —remembered her seventh birthday only too well. It was the only day when her father had obviously been happy to have such an unattractive child. \"A good revenge!\" he had told her mother. \"Giving my ugliest daughter to my enemy’s handsome son for his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen would there be no one she had to call father anymore?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed the Bluejay’s letter to her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBURNT WORDS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were setting off at sunrise. The Piper had accepted Mo’s conditions: The children of Ombra would be set free as soon as the Bluejay kept his promise and handed himself over to the Adderhead’s daughter. Some of the robbers were going to disguise themselves as women and wait outside the castle with the mothers, and Dustfinger would accompany Mo to Ombra as a fiery warning to the Piper. But the Bluejay would ride into the castle alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t call him that, Meggie, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only a few hours now until dawn. The Black Prince was sitting by the fire, wide awake, with Battista and Dustfinger, who didn’t appear to need any sleep at all now that he was back from the dead. Farid was sitting beside him, of course, and Roxane. But Dustfinger’s daughter had moved into Ombra Castle. Violante had taken Brianna back on the morning when the Piper had announced his agreement with the Bluejay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo wasn’t sitting by the fire with them. He had gone to lie down and get some sleep, and Resa was with him. How could he sleep tonight? The Strong Man was sitting outside the tent as if he must at least keep watch over the Bluejay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should sleep, too, Meggie,\" Mo had told her when he saw her sitting a little way from the others under the trees, but Meggie had only shaken her head. It was rainy, and her clothes were as damp and chilly as her hair, but it wasn’t much better inside the tents, and she didn’t want to lie there with the rain telling her how the Piper would greet her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meggie?\" Doria sat down in the wet grass beside her. His hair was wavy from the rain. \"Are you riding to Ombra, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Farid glanced at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ll steal into the castle as soon as your father has ridden through the door, I promise you,\" said Doria. \"And Dustfinger will stay near the castle, too. We’ll protect him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying?\" Meggie’s voice sounded sharper than she had intended,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can’t protect him, not just the two of you! The Piper will kill him. Are you thinking, ‘She’s only a girl, tell her lies to comfort her?’ I was with my father in the Castle of Night. I’ve faced the Adderhead. They’ll kill him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoria did not reply. He stayed silent for a long time, and she felt sorry she’d snapped at him like that. She wanted to say so, but she, too, remained silent, her head bent so that he wouldn’t see the tears she’d been holding back for hours. What he’d said had started them flowing. And now he’d be thinking, she’s a girl, she cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt Doria’s hand on her hair. He was stroking it as gently as if to wipe away the rain. \"He won’t ki]i him,\" he whispered to her. \"The Piper is far too frightened of the Adderhead for that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he hates my father! Hate is sometimes stronger than fear! And if the Piper doesn’t kill him, then the Milksop will do it, or the Adderhead himself. He’ll never get out of that castle ali\\Je, never!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow her hands were shaking as if a]l her fear was in her fingers. But Doria clasped them so firmly in his own hands that they couldn’t shake anymore. He had strong hands, although his fingers weren’t much longer than her own. Farid’s hands were slender by comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Farid says you saved your father once with words when he was wounded. He says you did it just with words.\" Yes, but she had no words this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Doria let go of her hands and looked at her with a question in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarid was still watching them, but Meggie ignored him. She planted a kiss on Doria’s cheek. \"Thank you!\" she said, quickly getting to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he didn’t understand what she was thanking him for. Words. The words that Orpheus had written! How could she have forgotten them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran through the wet grass to the tent where her parents Were sleeping. Mo will be terribly angry, she thought, but he’ll live! Hadn’t she read what would happen next into this story more than once already? It was time to do it again, even if that meant it wouldn’t end as Mo wanted. The Black Prince would just have to tell the rest of it. He’d find a way to make it turn out well, even Without the Bluejay’s aid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Bluejay must leave — before her father died with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Strong Man had nodded off. His head had sunk onto his chest, and he was snoring slightly as Meggie crept past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother was awake. She had been crying. \"I need to talk to you!\" Meggie whispered to her. \"Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo was fast asleep. Resa cast a glance at his sleeping face and then followed Meggie outside. They still weren’t speaking to each other very much. Meggie found it impossible to forget that night among the graves. Yet now she was about to do exactly what her mother had intended when she rode to Ombra in secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it’s about tomorrow,\" said Resa, taking her hand, \"don’t tell anyone, but I’m going to Ombra with them, even though your father doesn’t want me to. I want at least to be near him when he rides into the castle. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He’s not going to ride into the castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain was still falling through the fading leaves as if the trees were shedding tears, and Meggie longed for Elinor’s garden. The rain sounded so peaceful there. Here it whispered of nothing but death and danger. \"I’m going to read the words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustfinger turned, and for a moment Meggie was afraid he could see in her face what she planned to do and tell Mo, but he turned away again and kissed Roxane’s black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What words?\" Resa looked at her blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The words Orpheus wrote for you!\" The words for which Mo almost died, she wanted to add. Now they would save his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResa looked back at the tent where Mo was sleeping. \"I don’t have them anymore,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said. \"I burned them when your father didn’t come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They couldn’t have protected him anyway!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glass man appeared among dripping wet nettles, pale green like many of the glass men who still lived in the forest. He sneezed and scurried away in alarm at the sight of Meggie and Resa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother placed her hands on Meggie’s shoulders. \"He didn’t want to come with us, Meggie! He told Orpheus to write something just for us. Your father wants to stay, even now, and neither you nor I can force him to go back. He’d never forgive us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResa tried to stroke her daughter’s wet hair back from her forehead, but Meggie pushed her hand away. It couldn’t be true. She was lying. Mo would never stay here without his wife and daughter.., would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And perhaps he’s right. Perhaps everything will turn out well,\" said her mother quietly. \"And one dày we’ll be telling Elinor how your father saved the children of Ombra.\" Resa’s voice didn’t sound half as hopeful as her words. \"Bluejay,\" she whispered as she glanced at the men sitting by the fire. \"The first present your father ever gave me was a bookmark made of blue jay feathers. Isn’t that strange?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkdeath-inkworld-3/page-62.html","bookId":2721,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:40 PM"}
