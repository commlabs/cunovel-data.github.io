He is to be feared only when he pretends these traits. That was what my uncle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINQUISITOR: Those were his words, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHWI NOREE: More than that! Malky said, \"The Lord Leto delights in the surprising genius and diversity of humankind. He is my favorite companion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINQUISITOR: Giving us the benefit of your supreme wisdom, how do you interpret these words of your uncle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHWI NOREE: Do not mock me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINQUISITOR: We do not mock. We seek enlightenment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHWI NOREE: These words of Malky, and many other things that he wrote directly to me, suggest that the Lord Leto is always seeking after newness and originality but that he is wary of the destructive potential in such things. So my uncle believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINQUISITOR: Is there more which you wish to add to these beliefs which you share with your uncle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHWI NOREE: I see no point in adding to what I\u0027ve already said. I am sorry to have wasted the Inquisitors\u0027 time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINQUISITOR: But you have not wasted our time. You are confirmed as Ambassador to the Court of Lord Leto, the God Emperor of the known universe. -\u003d You must remember that I have at my internal demand every expertise known to our history. This is the fund of energy I -draw upon when I address the mentality of war. If you have not heard the moaning cries of the wounded and the dying, you do not know about war. I have heard those cries in such numbers that they haunt me. I have cried out myself in the aftermath of battle. I have suffered wounds in every epoch-wounds from fist and club and rock, from shell-studded limb and bronze sword, from the mace and the cannon, from arrows and lasguns and the silent smothering of atomic dust, from biological invasions which blacken the tongue and drown the lungs, from the swift gush of flame and the silent working of slow poisons... and more I will not recount! I have seen and felt them all. To those who dare ask why I behave as I do, I say: With my memories, I can do nothing else. I am not a coward and once I was human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals IN THE warm season when the satellite weather controllers were forced to contend with winds across the great seas, evening often saw rainfall at the edges of the Sareer. Moneo, coming in from one of his periodic inspections of the Citadel\u0027s perimeter, was caught in a sudden shower. Night fell before he reached shelter. A Fish Speaker guard helped him out of his damp cloak at the south portal. She was a heavyset, blocky woman with a square face, a type Leto favored for his guardians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those damned weather controllers should be made to shape up,\" she said as she handed him his damp cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo gave her a curt nod before beginning the climb to his quarters. All of the Fish Speaker guards knew the God Emperor\u0027s aversion to moisture, but none of them made Moneo\u0027s distinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the Worm who hates water, Moneo thought. Shai-Hulud hungers for Dune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his quarters, Moneo dried himself and changed to dry clothing before descending to the crypt. There was no point in inviting the Worm\u0027s antagonism. Uninterrupted conversation with Leto was required now, plain talk about the impending peregrination to the Festival City of Onn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning against a wall of the descending lift, Moneo closed his eyes. Immediately, fatigue swept over him. He knew he had not slept enough in days and there was no let up in sight. He envied Leto\u0027s apparent freedom from the need for sleep. A few hours of semi repose a month appeared to be sufficient for the God Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of the crypt and the stopping of the lift jarred Moneo from his catnap. He opened his eyes and looked out at the God Emperor on his cart in the center of the great chamber. Moneo composed himself and strode out for the familiar long walk into the terrible presence. As expected, Leto appeared alert. That, at least, was a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto had heard the lift approaching and saw Moneo awaken. The man looked tired and that was understandable. The peregrination to Onn was at hand with all of the tiresome business of off-planet visitors, the ritual with the Fish Speakers, the new ambassadors, the changing of the Imperial Guard, the retirements and the appointments, and now a new Duncan Idaho ghola to fit into the smooth working of the Imperial apparatus. Moneo was occupied with mounting details and he was beginning to show his age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me see, Leto thought. Moneo will be one hundred and eighteen years old in the week after our return from Onn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man could live many times that long if he would take the spice, but he refused. Leto had no doubt of the reason. Moneo had entered that peculiar human state where he longed for death. He lingered now only to see Siona installed in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyal Service, the next director of the Imperial Society of Fish Speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy houris, as Malky used to call them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Moneo knew it was Leto\u0027s intention to breed Siona with a Duncan. It was time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo stopped two paces from the cart and looked up at Leto. Something in his eyes reminded Leto of the look on the face of a pagan priest in the Terran times, a crafty supplication at the familiar shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, you have spent many hours observing the new Duncan,\" Moneo said. \"Have the Tleilaxu tampered with his cells or his psyche?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is untainted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep sigh shook Moneo. There was no pleasure in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You object to his use as a stud?\" Leto asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find it peculiar to think of him as both an ancestor and the father of my descendants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he gives me access to a first-generation cross between an older human form and the current products of my breeding program. Siona is twenty-one generations removed from such a cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fail to see the purpose. The Duncans are slower and less alert than anyone in your Guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not looking for good segregant offspring, Moneo. Did you think me unaware of the progression geometrics dictated by the laws which govern my breeding program?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen your stock book, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know that I keep track of the recessives and weed them out. The key genetic dominants are my concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the mutations, Lord?\" There was a sly note in Moneo\u0027s voice which caused Leto to study the man intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not discuss that subject, Moneo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto watched Moneo pull back into his cautious shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow extremely sensitive he is to my moods, Leto thought. I do believe he has some of my abilities there, although they operate at an unconscious level. His question suggests that he may even suspect what we have achieved in Siona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTesting this, Leto said, \"It is clear to me that you do not yet understand what I hope to achieve in my breeding program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo brightened. \"My Lord knows I try to fathom the rules of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laws tend to be temporary over the long haul, Moneo. There is no such thing as rule-governed creativity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Lord, you yourself speak of laws which govern your breeding program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have I just said to you, Moneo? Trying to find rules for creation is like trying to separate mind from body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But something is evolving, Lord. I know it in myself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows it in himself! Dear Moneo. He is so close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you always seek after absolutely derivative translations, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have heard you speak of transformational evolution, Lord. That is the label on your stock book. But what of surprise...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo! Rules change with each surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, have you no improvement of the human stock in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto glared down at him, thinking: If I use the key word now, will he understand? Perhaps...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a predator, Moneo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pred...\" Moneo broke off and shook his head. He knew the meaning of the word, he thought, but the word itself shocked him. Was the God Emperor joking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Predator, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The predator improves the stock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can this be, Lord? You do not hate us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You disappoint me, Moneo. The predator does not hate its prey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Predators kill, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kill, but I do not hate. Prey assuages hunger. Prey is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo peered up at Leto\u0027s face in its gray cowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave I missed the approach of the Worm? Moneo wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearfully, Moneo looked for the signs. There were no tremors in the giant body, no glazing of the eyes, no twisting of the useless flippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what do you hunger, Lord?\" Moneo ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a humankind which can make truly long-term decisions. Do you know the key to that ability, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have said it many times, Lord. It is the ability to change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change, yes. And do you know what I mean by longterm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you, it must be measured in millennia, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo, even my thousands of years are but a puny blip against Infinity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But your perspective must be different from mine, Lord.\" \"In the view of Infinity, any defined long-term is shortterm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then are there no rules at all, Lord?\" Moneo\u0027s voice conveyed a faint hint of hysteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto smiled to ease the man\u0027s tensions. \"Perhaps one. Short-term decisions tend to fail in the long-term.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo shook his head in frustration. \"But, Lord, your perspective is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time runs out for any finite observer. There are no closed systems. Even I only stretch the finite matrix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo jerked his attention from Leto\u0027s face and peered into the distances of the mausoleum corridors. I will be here someday. The Golden Path may continue, but I will end. That was not important, of course. Only the Golden Path which he could sense in unbroken continuity, only that mattered. He returned his attention to Leto, but not to the all-blue eyes. Was there truly a predator lurking in that gross body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not understand the function of a predator,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words shocked Moneo because they smacked of mind-reading. He lifted his gaze to Leto\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know intellectually that even I will suffer a kind of death someday,\" Leto said. \"But you do not believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I believe what I will never see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo had never felt more lonely and fearful. What was the God Emperor doing? I came down here to discuss the problems of the peregrination... and to find out about his intentions toward Siona. Does he toy with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us talk about Siona,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMind-reading again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you test her, Lord?\" The question had been waiting in the front of his awareness all this time, but now that he had spoken it, Moneo feared it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, Lord, but surely you know how much I fear for the well being of my only child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others have survived the test, Moneo. You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo gulped, remembering how he had been sensitized to the Golden Path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother prepared me. Siona has no mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has the Fish Speakers. She has you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accidents happen, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears sprang into Moneo\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto looked away from him, thinking: He is torn by his loyalty to me and his love of Siona. How poignant it is, this concern for an offspring. Can he not see that all of humankind is my only child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning his attention to Moneo, Leto said, \"You are right to observe that accidents happen even in my universe. Does this teach you nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, just this once couldn\u0027t you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo! Surely you do not ask me to delegate authority to a weak administrator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo recoiled one step. \"No, Lord. Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then trust Siona\u0027s strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo squared his shoulders. \"I will do what I must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Siona must be awakened to her duties as an Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that not our commitment, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not deny it, Lord. When will you introduce her to the new Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The test comes first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo looked down at the cold floor of the crypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at the floor so often, Leto thought. What can he possibly see there? Is it the millennial tracks of my cart? Ahhh, no-it is into the depths that he peers, into the realm of treasure and mystery which he expects to enter soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, Moneo lifted his gaze to Leto\u0027s face. \"I hope she will like the Duncan\u0027s company, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be assured of it. The Tleilaxu have brought him to me in the undistorted image.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is reassuring, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt you have noted that his genotype is remarkably attractive to females.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has been my observation, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something about those gently observant eyes, those strong features and that black-goat hair which positively melts the female psyche.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know he\u0027s with the Fish Speakers right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was informed, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto smiled. Of course Moneo was informed. \"They will bring him to me soon for his first view of the God Emperor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have inspected the viewing room personally, Lord. Everything is in readiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I think you wish to weaken me, Moneo. Leave some of these details for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo tried to conceal a constriction of fear. He bowed and backed away. \"Yes, Lord, but there are some things which I must do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, he hurried away. It was not until he was ascending in the lift that Moneo realized he had left without being dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must know how tired I am. He will forgive. -\u003d Your Lord knows very well what is in your heart. Your soul suffices this day as a reckoner against you. I need no witnesses. You do not listen to your soul, but listen instead to your anger and your rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Lord Leto to a Penitent,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the Oral History The following assessment of the state of the Empire in the year I of the reign of the Lord Leto is taken from The Welbeck Abridgment. The original is in the Chapter House Archives of the Bene Gesserit Order. A comparison reveals that the deletions do not subtract from the essential accuracy of this account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN THE name of our Sacred Order and its unbroken Sisterhood, this accounting has been judged reliable and worthy of entry into the Chronicles of the Chapter House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko have returned safely from Arrakis to report confirmation of the long-suspected execution of the nine historians who disappeared into his Citadel in the year I of Lord Leto\u0027s reign. The Sisters report that the nine were rendered unconscious, then burned on pyres of their own published works. This conforms exactly with the stories which spread across the Empire at the time. The accounts of that time were judged to have originated with Lord Leto himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko bring the handwritten records of an eyewitness account which says that when Lord Leto was petitioned by other historians seeking word of their fellows, Lord Leto said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were destroyed because they lied pretentiously. Have no fear that my wrath will fall upon you because of your innocent mistakes. I am not overly fond of creating martyrs. Martyrs tend to set dramatic events adrift in human affairs. Drama is one of the targets of my predation. Tremble only if you build false accounts and stand pridefully upon them. Go now and do not speak of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternal evidence of the handwritten account identifies its author as Ikonicre, Lord Leto\u0027s majordomo in the year. Attention is called to Lord Leto\u0027s use of the word predation. This is highly suggestive in view of theories advanced by Reverend Mother Syaksa that the God Emperor views himself as a predator in the natural sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh was invited to accompany the Fish Speakers in an entourage which accompanied one of Lord Leto\u0027s infrequent peregrinations. At one point, she was invited to trot beside the Royal Cart and converse with the Lord Leto himself. She reports the exchange as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto said: \"Here on the Royal Road, I sometimes feel that I stand on battlements protecting myself against invaders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh said: \"No one attacks you here, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto said: \"You Bene Gesserit assail me on all sides. Even now, you seek to suborn my Fish Speakers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh says that she steeled herself for death, but the God Emperor merely stopped his cart and looked across her at his entourage. She says the others stopped and waited on the road in well-trained passivity, all of them at a respectful distance.The Lord Leto said, \"There is my little multitude and they tell me everything. Do not deny my accusation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh said, \"I do not deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto looked at her then and said, \"Have no fear for your person. It is my wish that you report my words in your Chapter House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh says she could see then that the Lord Leto knew all about her, about her mission, her special training as an oral recorder, everything. \"He was like a Reverend Mother,\" she said. \"I could hide nothing from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto then commanded her, \"Look toward my Festival City and tell me what you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh looked toward Onn and said, \"I see the City in the distance. It is beautiful in this morning light. There is your forest on the right. It has so many greens in it I could spend all day describing them. On the left and all around the City there are the houses and the gardens of your servitors. Some of them look very rich and some look very poor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto said, \"We have cluttered this landscape! Trees are a clutter. Houses, gardens... You cannot exult at new mysteries in such a landscape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh, emboldened by Lord Leto\u0027s assurances, asked, \"Does the Lord truly want mysteries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto said, \"There is no outward spiritual freedom in such a landscape. Do you not see it? You have no open universe here with which to share. Everything is closures-doors, latches, locks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh asked, \"Has mankind no longer any need for privacy and protection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto said, \"When you return, tell your Sisters that I will restore the outward view. Such a landscape as this one turns you inward in search for whatever freedom your spirits can find within. Most humans are not strong enough to find freedom within.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh said, \" will report your words accurately, Lord. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto said, \"See that you do. Tell your Sisters also that the Bene Gesserit of all people should know the dangers of breeding for a particular characteristic, of seeking a defined genetic goal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Chenoeh says this was an obvious reference to the Lord Leto\u0027s father, Paul Atreides. Let it be noted that our breeding program achieved the Kwisatz Haderach one generation early. In becoming Muad\u0027Dib, the leader of the Fremen, Paul Atreides escaped from our control. There is no doubt that he was a male with the powers of a Reverend Mother and other powers for which humankind still is paying a heavy price. As the Lord Leto said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got the unexpected. You got me, the wild card. And I have achieved Siona.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto refused to elaborate on this reference to the daughter of his majordomo, Moneo. The matter is being investigated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other matters of concern to the Chapter House, our investigators have supplied information on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fish Speakers The Lord Leto\u0027s female legions have elected their representatives to attend the Decennial Festival on Arrakis. Three representatives will attend from each planetary garrison. (See attached list of those chosen.) As usual, no adult males will attend, not even consorts of Fish Speaker officers. The consort list has changed very little in this reporting period. We have appended the new names with genealogical information where available. Note that only two of the names can be starred as descendants of the Duncan Idaho gholas. We can add nothing new to our speculations about his use of the gholas in his breeding program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of our efforts to form an alliance between Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserit succeeded during this period. Lord Leto continues to increase certain garrison sizes. He also continues to emphasize the alternative missions of the Fish Speakers, de-emphasizing their military missions. This has had the expected result of increasing local admiration and respect and gratitude for the presence of the Fish Speaker garrisons. (See attached list for garrisons which were increased in size. Editor\u0027s note: The only pertinent garrisons were those on the home planets of the Bene Gesserit, Ixians and Tleilaxu. Spacing Guild monitors were not increased.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriesthood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for the few natural deaths and replacements which are listed in attachments, there have been no significant changes. Those consorts and officers delegated to perform the ritual duties remain few, their powers abridged by continuing requirement for consultation with Arrakis before taking any important action. It is the opinion of the Reverend Mother Syaksa and some others that the religious character of the Fish Speakers is slowly being devolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreeding Program\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than the unexplained reference to Siona and to our failure with his father, we have nothing significant to add to our continued monitoring of the Lord Leto\u0027s breeding program. There is evidence of a certain randomness in his plan which is reinforced by the Lord Leto\u0027s statement about genetic goals, but we cannot be certain that he was truthful with Sister Chenoeh. We call your attention to the many instances where he has either lied or changed directions dramatically and without warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto continues to prohibit our participation in his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreeding program. His monitors from our Fish Speaker garrison remain adamant in \"weeding out\" our births to which they object. Only by the most stringent controls were we able to maintain the level of Reverend Mothers during this reporting period. Our protests are not answered. In response to a direct question from Sister Chenoeh, the Lord Leto said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be thankful for what you have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis warning is duly noted here. We have transmitted a gracious letter of thankfulness to the Lord Leto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEconomics\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chapter House continues to maintain its solvency. but the measures of conservation cannot be eased. In fact, as a precaution, certain new measures will be instituted in the next reporting period. These include a reduction in the ritual uses of melange and an increase in the rates charged for our usual services. We expect to double the fees for the schooling of Great House females across the next four reporting periods. You are hereby charged to begin preparing your arguments in defense of this action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto has denied our petition for an increase in our melange allotment. No reason was given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur relationship with the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles remains on a sound footing. CHOAM has accomplished in the preceding period a regional cartel in Star Jewels, a project whereby we gained a substantial return through our advisory and bargaining functions. The ongoing profits from this arrangement should more than offset our losses on Giedi Prime. The Giedi Prime investment has been written off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Houses\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-one former Great Houses suffered economic disaster in this reporting period. Only six managed to maintain House Minor status. (See attached list.) This continues the general trend noted over the past thousand years where the once Great Houses melt gradually into the background. It is to be noted that the six who averted total disaster were all heavy investors in CHOAM and that five of these six were deeply involved in the Star Jewel project. The lone exception held a diversified\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eportfolio, including a substantial investment in antique whale fur from Caladan. (Our ponji rice reserves were increased almost twofold in this period at the expense of our whale fur holdings. The reasons for this decision will be reviewed in the next period.) Family Life As has been observed by our investigators over the preceding two thousand years, the homogenization of family life continues unabated. The exceptions are those you would expect: the Guild, the Fish Speakers, the Royal Courtiers, the shape-changing Face Dancers of the Tleilaxu (who are still mules despite all efforts to change that condition), and our own situation, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is to be noted that familial conditions grow more and more similar no matter the planet of residence, a circumstance which cannot be attributed to accident. We are seeing here the emergence of a portion of the Lord Leto\u0027s grand design. Even the poorest families are well fed, yes, but the circumstances of daily life grow increasingly static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe remind you of a statement from the Lord Leto which was reported here almost eight generations ago:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the only spectacle remaining in the Empire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverend Mother Syaksa has proposed a theoretical explanation for this trend, a theory which many of us are beginning to share. RM Syaksa attributes to Lord Leto a motive based on the concept of hydraulic despotism. As you know, hydraulic despotism is possible only when a substance or condition upon which life in general absolutely depends can be controlled by a relatively small and centralized force. The concept of hydraulic despotism originated when the flow of irrigation water increased local human populations to a demand level of absolute dependence. When the water was shut off, people died in large numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis phenomenon has been repeated many times in human history, not only with water and the products of arable land, but with hydrocarbon fuels such as petroleum and coal which were controlled through pipelines and other distribution networks. At one time, when distribution of electricity was only through complicated mazes of lines strung across the landscape, even this energy resource fell into the role of a hydraulic despotism substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRM Syaksa proposes that the Lord Leto is building the Empire toward an even greater dependence upon melange. It is worth noting that the aging process can be called a disease for which melange is the specific treatment, although not a cure. RM Syaksa proposes that the Lord Leto may even go so far as introducing a new disease which can only be suppressed by melange. Although this may appear farfetched, it should not be discarded out of hand. Stranger things have happened, and we should not overlook the role of syphilis in early human history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransport/Guild\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three-mode transportation system once peculiar to Arrakis (that is, on foot with heavy loads relegated to suspensorborne pallets; in the air via ornithopter; or off-planet by Guild transport) is coming to dominate more and more planets of the Empire. Ix is the primary exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe attribute this in part to planetary devolution into sedentary and static life-styles. And partly it is the attempt to copy the pattern of Arrakis. The generalized aversion to things Ixian plays no small part in this trend. There is also the fact that the Fish Speakers promote this pattern to reduce their work in maintaining order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the Guild\u0027s part in this trend hangs the absolute dependence of the Guild Navigators upon melange. We are, therefore, keeping a close watch upon the joint effort of Guild and Ix to develop a mechanical substitute for the Navigators\u0027 predictive talents. Without melange or some other means of projecting a heighliner\u0027s course, every translight Guild voyage risks disaster. Although we are not very sanguine about this Guild-Ixian project, there is always the possibility and we shall report on this as conditions warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe God Emperor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than some small increments of growth, we note little change in the bodily characteristics of the Lord Leto. A rumored aversion to water has not been confirmed, although the use of water as a barrier against the original sandworms of Dune is well documented in our records, as is the water-death by which\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFremen killed a small worm to produce the spice essence employed in their orgies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is considerable evidence for the belief that the Lord Leto has increased his surveillance of Ix, possibly because of the Guild-Ixian project. Certainly, success in that project would reduce his hold upon the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continues to do business with Ix, ordering replacement parts for his Royal Cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new ghola Duncan Idaho has been sent to the Lord Leto by the Tleilaxu. This makes it certain that the previous ghola is dead, although the manner of his death is not known. We call your attention to previous indications that the Lord Leto himself has killed some of his gholas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is increasing evidence that the Lord Leto employs computers. If he is, in fact, defying his own prohibitions and the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad, the possession of proof by us could increase our influence over him, possibly even to the extent of certain joint ventures which we have long contemplated. Sovereign control of our breeding program is still a primary concern. We will continue our investigation with, however, the following caveat:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with every report preceding this one, we must address the Lord Leto\u0027s prescience. There is no doubt that his ability to predict future events, an oracular ability much more powerful than that of any ancestor, is still the mainstay of his political control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not defy it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is our belief that he knows every important action we take far in advance of the event. We guide ourselves, therefore, by the rule that we will not knowingly threaten either his person or such of his grand plan as we can discern. Our address to him will continue to be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us if we threaten you that we may desist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us of your grand plan that we may help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has provided no new answers to either question during this period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ixians Other than the Guild-Ix project, there is little of significance to report. Ix is sending a new Ambassador to the Court of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Leto, one Hwi Noree, a niece of the Malky who once was reputed to be such a boon companion of the God Emperor. The reason for the choice of replacement is not known, although there is a small body of evidence that this Hwi Noree was bred for a specific purpose, possibly as the Ixian representative at the Court. We have reason to believe that Malky also was genetically designed with that official context in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will continue to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Museum Fremen These degenerate relics of the once-proud warriors continue to function as our major source of reliable information about affairs on Arrakis. They represent a major budget item for our next reporting period because their demands for payment are increasing and we dare not antagonize them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is interesting to note that although their lives bear little resemblance to that of their ancestors, their performance of Fremen rituals and their ability to ape Fremen ways remains flawless. We attribute this to Fish Speaker influence upon Fremen training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tleilaxu We do not expect the new ghola of Duncan Idaho to provide any surprises. The Tleilaxu continue to be much chastened by the Lord Leto\u0027s reaction to their one attempt at changing the cellular nature and the psyche of the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent envoy from the Tleilaxu renewed their attempts to entice us into a joint venture, the avowed purpose being the production of a totally female society without the need for males. For all of the obvious reasons, including our distrust of everything Tleilaxu, we responded with our usual polite negative. Our Embassy to the Lord Leto\u0027s Decennial Festival will make a full report of this to him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-5.html","bookId":2156,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM"}
