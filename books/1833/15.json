She’ll want to prolong my agony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them kept glancing at the spiral staircase, expecting to see Anne coming down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve already checked every window I could reach. They’re all wired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I would expect so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I could be calm like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not calm,” Sara protested. “I’m quite . . . discombobulated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer choice of words made Carrie smile. “So am I,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m thinking . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How curious it is that the three of us are in this house together. What is it that we have in common?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Carrie said. “And I don’t know that we’ll have the time to find out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer resolve bolstered Carrie. “Yes, we must, and we will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder what’s keeping Anne.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to be a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie nodded. “She won’t admit she received a letter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps she’s in shock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie thought Sara might be right about that. “And denial,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to all have to work together, but I don’t know how much help I can be. I’ll do whatever I can. I’m sixty-eight years old.” Sara shrugged. “And I’m terribly out of shape. When I received the invitation for a free two-week stay at the spa as a promotion, I thought to myself, why not? The experts say it’s never too late to turn your life around. I decided to get into better shape. As you can see, I’m overweight, and once we get outside—and we will find a way to do that,” she said with conviction, “I won’t be able to walk far. I should have had both of my knees replaced several years ago. I’m walking with bone on bone now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then Anne and I will hide you somewhere . . . somewhere safe in the woods while we go get help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard a door close and both looked up. Anne had finally decided to join them. Carrie’s mouth dropped open when the frail woman started down the stairs. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Anne was all dressed up in a hot pink St. John pants suit. Her gold earrings matched the buttons. She had taken the time to put on makeup and curl her hair. When she reached the bottom of the stairs, she smiled, and then crossed the living room to join them. Her high heels clicked against the marble floor. Where in heaven’s name did she think she was going? A formal brunch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, dear,” Sara whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, ladies,” Anne said. “Or rather, good afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded so cheerful. Had her mind snapped? Carrie wondered. She was about to ask the woman what the hell was the matter with her when Sara suggested Anne sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you sleep well?” Anne asked Sara. Then, before she could answer, Anne continued on. “I can’t believe I slept so long. It must be this wonderful mountain air. Coming from Cleveland, it’s a delightful change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you care for some coffee?” Sara asked. She was watching her closely, as though she was trying to interpret the woman’s bizarre behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not just yet. I’ll ring when I’m ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie turned to Sara. “I told you she was going to be a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. What did you say?” Anne asked. She carefully sat down and crossed one ankle over the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie turned to her. “It wasn’t the wonderful mountain air that made you sleep so long, Anne. We were all drugged.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s nonsense. Look where we are,” she said. “Who would do such a thing in this beautiful—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie cut her off. “Did you bring your letter down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what I mean?” Carrie asked Sara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge took over. “Anne, Carrie and I each received a letter. They’re there on the coffee table. Please read them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie noticed that Anne’s hand was violently shaking as she reached for the letters. She picked them up and then quickly placed them back on the table. “I don’t need to read these.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you do,” Sara gently asserted. “You’ll see that we’re in trouble here. Someone has wired this place to kill us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What rubbish,” Anne muttered. “I will not have my day ruined with this ridiculous game you two are playing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re locked inside this house,” Sara told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no use,” Carrie said. “I tried to tell her all of this upstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re lying,” Anne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie considered punching the woman. She thought she’d probably kill her if she did because Anne was so painfully thin and sickly. A good wind could have done her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If any of us opens a window or door, the house will blow up,” Sara patiently explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither she nor Carrie anticipated Anne’s reaction. The woman bolted from her chair and ran across the living room. “You’re only lying to get me upset. The house isn’t wired, and I’m going to prove it to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was headed for the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOHN PAUL HAD TO HANG AROUND UTOPIA LONGER THAN HE’D anticipated, but the wait was worth it. He was sitting, or rather sprawling, in an easy chair half hidden behind a couple of limp palm trees inside the lobby’s bar when Avery Delaney walked inside. One hard look and he had her all figured out. She was a typical California blonde. No, maybe not typical. She was unique, he’d give her that. But she was definitely all about her body. Why else would she want to spend a week at a spa? Why would anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Delaney woman wore a short white T-shirt that fit snugly across her full breasts, and tight jeans, obviously intending to show off her long legs and her tight ass. Her long, straight, blond hair shimmered in the light. It looked natural, but he doubted that it was. Probably came from a bleach bottle. Her sunglasses hid her eyes, but he figured she was probably wearing colored contact lenses. Her T-shirt hid her belly button, but he wouldn’t have been surprised to find that she’d had it pierced. Wasn’t that the fashion these days?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was hot, all right. In fact, Avery Delaney was a beautiful woman, but she wasn’t his type. She was a little too perfect for his tastes. Sexy as sin, though. As he watched her stop and take in her surroundings—pretending she didn’t notice how the other guests had stopped to stare at her—John Paul wondered how much of her was real and how much had been cosmetically “enhanced.” The breasts, definitely. And maybe even the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t the kind of woman he’d want to have a lasting relationship with, but then he didn’t want a lasting relationship with any woman. One night with her, however, sounded like a damned good idea. Hell, the woman probably had the IQ of a tsetse fly, but in bed, brainpower really didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Airhead couldn’t seem to figure out where check-in was. Was she waiting for someone to take her hand and lead her across the lobby? She was looking up at the golden sphere slowly rotating like one of those old disco balls. Had the thing hypnotized her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery knew she was gawking like a tourist. She couldn’t help it; Utopia was incredible. The lobby was gigantic, the floors a shiny, ebony marble. Above her, hanging from the gilded dome was a glistening orb. She couldn’t take her gaze off it. Was it real gold? It must have cost the owners a fortune, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to her right and stopped again. One entire wall was a waterfall, and in the center of the gathering pool was a statue of Atlas. Another smaller sphere was perched on his shoulder. Both the sculpture and the bubbling waterfall were meant to impress the guests willing to pay a fortune to be pampered in such an environment, and in Avery’s estimation, the owners got the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head over the expense of it all, she pulled up the strap of the old, hand-me-down Gucci backpack Carrie had given her, and crossed the lobby to the reception desk. A man about her age wearing a name tag labeled “Oliver” stood behind the granite counter waiting to welcome her. His smile was dazzling, his teeth astonishingly white. Freakishly so. He or his dentist had obviously overdone the bleach job, and his artificially tanned face only made his teeth more prominent. She tried not to stare as she gave him her name and leaned against the cool counter while he pulled up her reservation on the built-in computer screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver’s smile blessedly vanished. “Oh, dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t looking at her now, but stared intently at the screen when he said, “Your reservation was canceled, Miss Delaney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that has to be a mistake. I didn’t cancel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“According to my computer, you canceled. It’s noted right here,” he added, pointing to his screen, which she couldn’t possibly see unless she pole-vaulted over the countertop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The computer’s never wrong. You called Utopia at . . .” He was trying to pull up the exact time she called in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oliver,” she said. Her impatience was brimming in her voice. “I didn’t cancel. In fact, I called to tell reception I would be a day late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you did,” he agreed, pointing to the screen once again. “But then you called again and canceled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I didn’t,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But my computer—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe interrupted him before he could tell her his computer was infallible again. “Why don’t you just book me into another room. Anything will do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her backpack and placed it on the counter. She began to dig through it looking for her billfold so she could give Oliver her credit card. Against her wishes, the week had been paid for by her aunt, but Avery wanted the charges transferred to her card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver, she noticed, had stopped typing. “Is something wrong?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coughed delicately and finally looked at her. “I’m afraid it won’t be possible to book you into another room, and unfortunately, the room you canceled has already been assigned to another guest. We’re at a hundred percent occupancy,” he continued. “I’ll be happy to put you on our waiting list, but I must warn you. There’s little chance of an opening. Our guests book months in advance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m certain my aunt was able to reserve a room for me here,” she protested. “If there had been a problem I’m sure she would have told me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was frantically typing again. Then he stopped and nodded. “Yes, we were able to accommodate you because of another cancellation. That is peculiar,” he added. “Our guests rarely cancel at the last minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned as he said the last, as though by canceling, he thought she had committed a terrible breach in etiquette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I didn’t cancel,” she said. Lord, this was frustrating. “I’m joining my aunt here,” she explained. “She checked in yesterday afternoon or early evening. Could you give me her room number? Her name’s Carolyn Salvetti.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, but we aren’t allowed to give out the room numbers of our guests.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he couldn’t. She knew that. “Please call her room. I’m sure she’ll be able to clear up this misunderstanding. She might have decided that I should stay with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver looked relieved that the problem would be solved and he could get rid of her. Fortunately, there weren’t any other guests waiting in line to check in. He flashed her another startling smile and said, “I’m sure that’s what must have happened. Guests simply do not cancel at the last minute the way you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the sudden urge to grab him by his shoulders and shake him until he admitted the spa had screwed up. Gritting her teeth to keep from saying something she would regret, she spelled the name Salvetti and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that name,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “A gentleman was in here yesterday asking for your aunt. He was very disappointed she wasn’t here.” He started typing, but a couple of seconds later, he was frowning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a problem?” she asked, knowing full well there was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are no problems at Utopia,” he said, and it was such a quick, automatic response she thought he’d been programmed to say those very words. “We do occasionally have minor inconveniences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive me a break. “All right. Explain the minor inconvenience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Salvetti canceled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver’s shoulders slumped. She knew what he was thinking. Here we go again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid Mrs. Salvetti did cancel. It is odd, I’ll agree. It’s so rare to get two last-minute cancellations like this. Of course, you’re both members of the same family, so I guess we could say it was really only one last-minute cancellation for two rooms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me. My aunt didn’t cancel. She called me from the Aspen airport yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps something came up at the last minute and she had to return home,” he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something’s very wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s right here in my computer, Miss Delaney. Your aunt called yesterday afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in the world was going on? As much as Avery wanted to continue to argue with Oliver, she knew it wouldn’t solve anything. She wasn’t sure what to do now. If an emergency had come up at work and Carrie had had to return to Los Angeles, she would have called. She wouldn’t have left Avery hanging like this. Oh, God, what if something had happened to her or Uncle Tony? What if there had been an accident?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm down, she told herself. If anything bad had happened to either Carrie or Tony, one or the other would have called her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery began searching her backpack for her phone. She would get hold of Carrie on her cell phone right this minute and find out what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled out her Day-Timer and her billfold, clutched them in her right hand, and kept searching for her phone with her other hand. The damned thing always ended up on the bottom. “My aunt didn’t cancel,” she muttered. Then, more to herself than Oliver, she added, “There must have been a crisis at work. That’s all I can think of to make Carrie turn around and go back home.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killjoy-buchanan-renard-3/page-15.html","bookId":1833,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:17 PM"}
