A voice she knew well since she seemed to have been hearing it at least once a week since early November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a virgin,\" Sibby announced, like she was confirming a sad fact she\u0027d long suspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you at least have a boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at this-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any friends? You\u0027re not really very good at conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda was beginning to understand why the girl\u0027s relatives hadn\u0027t come to the airport for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have lots of friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.

It would be an improvement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB polite! \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you pull up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, we\u0027re at a stoplight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go forward a tiny-perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking in the side mirror, Miranda saw that Sibby had rolled down her window and was leaning out, saying now to the guys in the jeep next to them, \"Where are you boys going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys answered, \"A little moonlight surfing. Want to come, goddess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a goddess. Do you think I look like one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell.

You sound like you\u0027re eighty, not eighteen.\" She scowled at Miranda in the mirror. \"I thought you were a driver, not a jailer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my job to make sure you get where you\u0027re going in a safe and timely manner. That\u0027s printed on the card you\u0027ll find in your seat pocket, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is kissing some boys going to make me unsafe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A million different ways. What if they have an invisible mouth fungus? Or DeathLip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no such thing as DeathLip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just jealous because I know how to have fun and you don\u0027t. Virgin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda rolled her eyes but kept quiet, listening to cell phone conversations from the cars behind them, a woman telling someone that the gardener was on his way, a guy saying in a mystical voice, \"I see a mysterious stranger coming for you, I can\u0027t quite tell if it\u0027s a man or a woman.\" Another man talking to someone about how he wanted to take that bitch out of the will and it didn\u0027t matter if she was his mother\u0027s favorite dog-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was interrupted suddenly by Sibby shouting, \"Inn-Out Burger! We have to stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB accommodating!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda agreed to let Sibby order her own at the drive-through, then regretted it when she heard the girl saying to the guy taking the order, \"Do I get a discount if I let you kiss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, seriously, were you raised on Crazycake? Why do you want to kiss all these guys you don\u0027t even know?\" Miranda asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t that many boys where I come from. And what does knowing them have to do with it? Kissing is great. I kissed four boys on the airplane. I\u0027m hoping to make it twenty-five before the end of the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe added the two working the drive-through lane when she got her burger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are all hamburgers that delicious?\" she asked when they were on the road again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda glanced at her in the rearview mirror. \"You\u0027ve never had a burger before? Where do you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mountains,\" Sibby answered quickly, and Miranda picked up a slight rise in her heart rate, suggesting that she was lying and not used to it. Which seemed hugely unlikely-the not-used-to-it part-for someone who had a case of acute Boy Crazy like this girl. Her parents couldn\u0027t possibly let her run around-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh So Very Much Not Your Problem, Miranda reminded herself. B discreet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby tried to solicit kisses from four other guys as they drove. They were a mile from the drop-off point and Miranda was thinking that the ride could not be over soon enough when Sibby shrieked, \"Oh my gods, a doughnut store! I\u0027ve always wanted to try doughnuts, too. Can we stop? Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were already almost an hour late but Miranda couldn\u0027t deny anyone a doughnut. Even someone who said, \"Oh my gods.\" But pulling in, she saw a group of guys sitting at a table inside and decided that it would be dangerous to let Sibby near them if she wanted to get out of there in under forty minutes. \"I\u0027ll go in and get them, you stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby had seen the guys, too. \"No way, I\u0027m coming in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either your butt stays in the car, Kissing Bandit, or the doughnuts stay in the store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a nice way to talk to customers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feel free to use my phone to file a complaint while I\u0027m inside. Do we have a deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. But will you at least roll down the window?\" Miranda hesitated. Sibby said, \"Look, Grandma, I promise I\u0027ll keep my butt in the car, I just don\u0027t want to suffocate. Gods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Miranda came out, Sibby had wedged herself in the window with her body and legs outside the car and her rear hanging back into it, and was deeply involved in kissing a blond guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Miranda said, tapping the guy on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around kind of hazy, looked her up and down. \"Hello, dream girl. You want a kiss, too? I could do something really special with lips like yours. You wouldn\u0027t even have to pay me a dollar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, but no.\" Looking at Sibby now. \"I thought we\u0027d agreed that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;my butt would stay in the car. Where, if you bothered to look, you would see it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda turned away so Sibby wouldn\u0027t see her crack up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed Sibby the doughnuts and slid into the driver\u0027s seat. Once Sibby had wiggled back through the window, Miranda caught her eye in the rearview. \"You were paying guys to kiss you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" Sibby glared. \"Not all of us can get kissed for free.\" More glaring, then, \"You barely have boobs. My boobs are bigger than yours. It makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby got quiet, not even eating her doughnut. From time to time she\u0027d sigh dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda started feeling a little sorry. Maybe she had been acting like a grandma. She looked at How to Get-And Kiss-Your Guy on the seat next to her. Maybe you\u0027re jealous she\u0027s four years younger than you but has already kissed more guys in one day than you\u0027ll probably date in your whole life even if you get a boob job and live to be two trillion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, U-Suck channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should be nice, make conversation. \"How many kisses is it total now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby kept her eyes on her lap. \"Ten.\" Looking up to add, \"But I only paid six of them. And one of them I only gave a quarter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda saw Sibby look up suspiciously, like she thought she was being made fun of, decide she wasn\u0027t, and start picking at her doughnut. After a while she said, \"Can I ask you a question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re asking permission now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For real, just please stop trying to be funny. It\u0027s painful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the hot tip. Did you have a question or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you want to kiss that boy back there? The one who wanted to kiss you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess he\u0027s not my type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your type?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda thought of Deputy Reynolds-blue eyes and cleft jaw and shaggy blond hair, getting up every morning to go surfing. The kind of guy who always wore sunglasses or looked at you with his eyes half closed and was too cool for smiling. Then pictured Will with his dark, maple-syrup-color skin, short curly hair, huge boyish smile, and abs that rippled when he stood talking, shirtless, with the other players after lacrosse practice, body glimmering in the sun, his laugh ringing out and making her feel like she felt when she saw butter melting on perfectly cooked Belgian waffles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she routinely jumped up onto the roof of the marine biology lab when no one was looking to watch this. (Weekly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s more a feeling than a type,\" Miranda said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many boys have you kissed? A hundred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda felt herself blushing and hoped Sibby couldn\u0027t see. \"Keep guessing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pulled up to the address she\u0027d been given, an hour and fifteen minutes later than they should have, the first time she\u0027d ever dropped a client off late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Miranda opened the car door for her, Sibby asked, \"Is kissing a boy who\u0027s your type really different than kissing just any boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s complicated.\" Miranda was surprised at how relieved she was that she wouldn\u0027t have to go into it more, admit to this girl that, actually, she had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place looked more like a government safe house for witnesses than a home, she thought, walking Sibby to the door. It was like the dictionary definition of nondescript, sandwiched between a house with Snow White and the Seven Dwarves enacting the Nativity on the front lawn on one side, and one with a pink-and-orange swing set on the other. The only thing you noticed about this house was that there were thick curtains hanging in the front windows so you couldn\u0027t see in, and a six-foot-tall solid wood fence blocking off the backyard so you couldn\u0027t get in. The street was filled with noises-Miranda heard BBQs sizzling, conversations, someone watching Beauty and the Beast in Spanish-but this house was silent, as though it had been soundproofed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe registered a low humming coming from the side, like an air conditioner but not quite. Glancing up, she saw that none of the power lines connected to this house. None of the phone lines, either. A generator. Whoever lived here was living off the grid. All in all, the whole place was really cozy, if cozy meant creepy and cultish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the woman who opened the front door? Exactly what you\u0027d expect of someone creepy and cultish, Miranda thought. She had graying hair pulled back in a loose bun and was wearing a long skirt and kind of shapeless sweater. She could have been anywhere from thirty to sixty years old, it was impossible to tell because she was wearing a pair of huge bifocals with unflattering square frames that magnified her eyes and covered half her face. She looked completely harmless, like a schoolteacher who\u0027d dedicated her life to caring for an aging relative and whose one indulgence was a secret crush on Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr almost like that. Like that was the look she\u0027d been going for. But there was something wrong, some tiny thing that did not quite match, one tiny detail that wasn\u0027t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. Not. Your. Business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda said good-bye, took her $1.00 tip-\"Because you were really quite late, dear\"-and drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was half a block away when she slammed on the brakes and sprinted back to the house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-20.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
