By law, each narcotic that is taken from the dispensary must be signed for, but no matter how controlled the security is, drug addicts almost invariably find a way to circumvent it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarcadero County Hospital was having a major problem. Margaret Spencer went to see Ben Wallace. \"I don\u0027t know what to do, doctor. Our fentanyl keeps disappearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFentanyl is a highly addictive narcotic and anesthetic drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much is missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A great deal. If it were just a few bottles, there could be an innocent explanation for it, but it\u0027s happening now on a regular basis. More than a dozen bottles a week are disappearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea who might be taking it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. I\u0027ve talked to security. They\u0027re at a loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who has access to the dispensary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the problem. Most of the anesthetists have pretty free access to it, and most of the nurses and surgeons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace was thoughtful. \"Thank you for coming to me. I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, doctor.\" Nurse Spencer left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t need this right now, Wallace thought angrily. A hospital board meeting was coming up, and there were already enough problems to be dealt with. Ben Wallace was well aware of the statistics. More than 10 percent of the doctors in the United States became addicted, at one time or another, to either drugs or alcohol. The easy accessibility of the drugs made them a temptation. It was simple for a doctor to open a cabinet, take out the drug he wanted, and use a tourniquet and syringe to inject it. An addict could need a fix as often as every two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was happening at his hospital. Something had to be done about it before the board meeting. It would look bad on my record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen Wallace was not sure whom he could trust to help him find the culprit. He had to be careful. He was certain that neither Dr. Taylor nor Dr. Hunter was involved, and after a great deal of thought, he decided to use them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent for the two of them. \"I have a favor to ask of you,\" he told them. He explained about the missing fentanyl. \"I want you to keep your eyes open. If any of the doctors you work with have to step out of the OR for a moment, in the middle of an operation, or show any other signs of addiction, I want you to let me know. Look for any changes in personality - depression or mood swings - or tardiness, or missed appointments. I would appreciate it if you would keep this strictly confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they left the office, Kat said, \"This is a big hospital. We\u0027re going to need Sherlock Holmes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we won\u0027t,\" Paige said unhappily. \"I know who it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch Campbell was one of Paige\u0027s favorite doctors. Dr. Campbell was a likable gray-haired man in his fifties, always good-humored, and one of the hospital\u0027s best surgeons. Paige had noticed lately that he was always a few minutes late for an operation, and that he had developed a noticeable tremor. He used Paige to assist him as often as possible, and he usually let her do a major part of the surgery. In the middle of an operation, his hands would begin to shake and he would hand the scalpel to Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not feeling well,\" he would mumble. \"Would you take over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he would leave the operating room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige had been concerned about what could be wrong with him. Now she knew. She debated what to do. She was aware that if she brought her information to Wallace, Dr. Campbell would be fired, or worse, his career would be destroyed. On the other hand, if she did nothing, she would be putting patients\u0027 lives in danger. Perhaps I could talk to him, Paige thought. Tell him what I know, and insist that he get treatment. She discussed it with Kat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a problem,\" Kat agreed. \"He\u0027s a nice guy, and a good doctor. If you blow the whistle, he\u0027s finished, but if you don\u0027t, you have to think about the harm he might do. What do you think will happen if you confront him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll probably deny it, Kat. That\u0027s the usual pattern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. It\u0027s a tough call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, Paige had an operation scheduled with Dr. Campbell. I hope I\u0027m wrong, Paige prayed. Don\u0027t let him be late, and don\u0027t let him leave during the operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell was fifteen minutes late, and in the middle of the operation, he said, \"Take over, will you, Paige? I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must talk to him, Paige decided. I can\u0027t destroy his career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, as Paige and Honey drove into the doctors\u0027 parking lot, Harry Bowman pulled up next to them in the red Ferrari.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a beautiful car,\" Honey said. \"How much does one of those cost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowman laughed. \"If you have to ask, you can\u0027t afford it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paige wasn\u0027t listening. She was staring at the car, and thinking about the penthouse, the lavish parties, and the boat. I was smart enough to have a clever father. He left all his money to me. And yet Bowman worked at a county hospital. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Paige was in the personnel office, talking to Karen, the secretary in charge of records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do me a favor, will you, Karen? Just between us, Harry Bowman has asked me to go out with him and I have a feeling he\u0027s married. Would you let me have a peek at his personnel file?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Those horny bastards. They never get enough, do they? You\u0027re darn right I\u0027ll let you look at his file.\" She went over to a cabinet and found what she was looking for. She brought some papers back to Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige glanced through them quickly. Dr. Harry Bowman\u0027s application showed that he had come from a small university in the Midwest and, according to the records, had worked his way through medical school. He was an anesthesiologist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father was a barber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney Taft was an enigma to most of the doctors at Embarcadero County Hospital. During the morning rounds, she appeared to be unsure of herself. But on the afternoon rounds, she seemed like a different person. She was surprisingly knowledgeable about each patient, and crisp and efficient in her diagnoses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the senior residents was discussing her with a colleague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be damned if I understand it,\" he said. \"In the morning, the complaints about Dr. Taft keep piling up. She keeps making mistakes. You know the joke about the nurse who gets everything wrong? A doctor is complaining that he told her to give the patient in Room 4 three pills, and she gave the patient in Room 3 four pills, and just as he\u0027s talking about her, he sees her chasing a naked patient down the hall, holding a pan of boiling water. The doctor says, \u0027Look at that! I told her to prick his boil!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis colleague laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s Dr. Taft. But in the afternoon she\u0027s absolutely brilliant. Her diagnoses are correct, her notes are wonderful, and she\u0027s as sharp as hell. She must be taking some kind of miracle pill that only works afternoons.\" He scratched his head. \"It beats the hell out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Nathan Ritter was a pedant, a man who lived and worked by the book. While he lacked the spark of brilliance, he was capable and dedicated, and he expected the same qualities from those who worked with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney had the misfortune to be assigned to his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir first stop was a ward containing a dozen patients. One of them was just finishing breakfast. Ritter looked at the chart at the foot of the bed. \"Dr. Taft, the chart says this is your patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s having a bronchoscopy this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney nodded. \"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re allowing him to eat?\" Dr. Ritter snapped. \"Before a bronchoscopy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney said, \u0027\"\u0027The poor man hasn\u0027t had anything to eat since - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Ritter turned to his assistant. \"Postpone the procedure.\" He started to say something to Honey, then controlled himself. \"Let\u0027s move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next patient was a Puerto Rican who was coughing badly. Dr. Ritter examined him. \"Whose patient is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine,\" Honey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"His infection should have cleared up before now.\" He took a look at the chart. \"You\u0027re giving him fifty milligrams of ampicillin four times a day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not right. It\u0027s wrong. That\u0027s supposed to be five hundred milligrams four times a day. You left off a zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder the patient\u0027s not getting any better! I want it changed immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they came to another patient of Honey\u0027s, Dr. Ritter said impatiently, \"He\u0027s scheduled for a colonoscopy. Where is the radiology report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The radiology report? Oh. I\u0027m afraid I forgot to order one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitter gave Honey a long, speculative look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning went downhill from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next patient they saw was moaning tearfully. \"I\u0027m in such pain. What\u0027s wrong with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know,\" Honey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Ritter glared at her. \"Dr. Taft, may I see you outside for a moment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corridor, he said, \"Never, never tell a patient that you don\u0027t know. You\u0027re the one they\u0027re looking to for help! And if you don\u0027t know the answer, make one up. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t seem right to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t ask you whether it seemed right. Just do as you\u0027re told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey examined a hiatal hernia, a hepatitis patient, a patient with Alzheimer\u0027s disease, and two dozen others. The minute the rounds were over, Dr. Ritter went to Benjamin Wallace\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a problem,\" Ritter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of the residents here. Honey Taft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain? \"What about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she had such a wonderful recommendation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, you\u0027d better get rid of her before the hospital gets in real trouble, before she kills a patient or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace thought about it for a moment, then made his decision. \"Right. She\u0027ll be out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was busy in surgery most of the morning. As soon as she was free, she went to see Dr. Wallace, to tell him of her suspicions about Harry Bowman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bowman? Are you sure? I mean ... I\u0027ve seen no signs of any addiction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t use it,\" Paige explained. \"He sells it. He\u0027s living like a millionaire on a resident\u0027s salary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen Wallace nodded. \"Very well. I\u0027ll check it out. Thank you, Paige.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace sent for Bruce Anderson, head of security. \"We may have identified the drug thief,\" Wallace told him. \"I want you to keep a close watch on Dr. Harry Bowman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bowman?\" Anderson tried to conceal his surprise. Dr. Bowman was constantly giving the guards Cuban cigars and other little gifts. They all loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he goes into the dispensary, search him when he comes out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Bowman was headed for the dispensary. He had orders to fill. A lot of orders. It had started as a lucky accident. He had been working in a small hospital in Ames, Iowa, struggling to get by on a resident\u0027s salary. He had champagne taste and a beer pocketbook, and then Fate had smiled on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his patients who had been discharged from the hospital telephoned him one morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor, I\u0027m in terrible pain. You have to give me something for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to check back in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to leave the house. Couldn\u0027t you bring something here for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowman thought about it. \"All right. I\u0027ll drop by on my way home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he visited the patient, he brought with him a bottle of fentanyl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patient grabbed it. \"That\u0027s wonderful!\" he said. He pulled out a handful of bills. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowman looked at him, surprised. \"You don\u0027t have to pay me for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? This stuff is like gold. I have a lot of friends who will pay you a fortune if you bring them this stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how it had begun. Within two months, Harry Bowman was making more money than he had ever dreamed possible. Unfortunately, the head of the hospital got wind of what was going on. Fearing a public scandal, he told Bowman that if he left quietly, nothing would appear on his record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m glad I left, Bowman thought. San Francisco has a much bigger market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the dispensary. Bruce Anderson was standing outside. Bowman nodded to him. \"Hi, Bruce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Dr. Bowman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later when Bowman came out of the dispensary, Anderson said, \"Excuse me. I\u0027m going to have to search you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Bowman stared at him. \"Search me? What are you talking about, Bruce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, doctor. We have orders to search everyone who uses the dispensary,\" Anderson lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowman was indignant. \"I\u0027ve never heard of such a thing. I absolutely refuse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll have to ask you to come along with me to Dr. Wallace\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine! He\u0027s going to be furious when he hears about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowman stormed into Wallace\u0027s office. \"What\u0027s going on, Ben? This man wanted to search me, for God\u0027s sake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you refuse to be searched?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Wallace reached for the telephone. \"I\u0027ll let the San Francisco police do it, if you prefer.\" He began to dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowman panicked. \"Wait a minute! That\u0027s not necessary.\" His face suddenly cleared. \"Oh! I know what this is all about!\" He reached in his pocket and took out a bottle of fentanyl. \"I was taking these to use for an operation, and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace said quietly, \"Empty your pockets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of desperation came over Bowman\u0027s face. \"There\u0027s no reason to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Empty your pockets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, the San Francisco office of the Drug Enforcement Agency had a signed confession and the names of the people to whom Bowman had been selling drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige heard the news, she went to see Mitch Campbell. He was sitting in an office, resting. His hands were on the desk when Paige walked in, and she could see the tremor in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell quickly moved his hands to his lap. \"Hello, Paige. How\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, Mitch. I wanted to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a seat opposite him. \"How long have you had Parkinson\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned a shade whiter. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027ve been trying to cover it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heavy silence. \"I ... I ... yes. But I ... I can\u0027t give up being a doctor. I ... I just can\u0027t give it up. It\u0027s my whole life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige leaned forward and said earnestly, \"You don\u0027t have to give up being a doctor, but you shouldn\u0027t be operating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked suddenly old. \"I know. I was going to quit last year.\" He smiled wanly. \"I guess I\u0027ll have to quit now, won\u0027t I? You\u0027re going to tell Dr. Wallace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Paige said gently. \"You\u0027re going to tell Dr. Wallace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was having lunch in the cafeteria when Tom Chang joined her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard what happened,\" he said. \"Bowman! Unbelievable. Nice work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I almost had the wrong man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang sat there, silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want the \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 or do you want the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re friends. I want the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My marriage has gone to hell.\" His eyes suddenly filled with tears. \"Sye has left. She\u0027s gone back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not her fault. We didn\u0027t have a marriage anymore. She said I\u0027m married to the hospital, and she\u0027s right. I\u0027m spending my whole life here, taking care of strangers, instead of being with the people I love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll come back. It will work out,\" Paige said soothingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought about counseling, or ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She refuses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Tom. If there\u0027s anything I ...\" She heard her name on the loudspeaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Taylor, Room 410 ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige felt a sudden pang of alarm. \"I have to go,\" she said. Room 410. That was Sam Bernstein\u0027s room. He was one of her favorite patients, a gentle man in his seventies who had been brought in with inoperable stomach cancer. Many of the patients at the hospital were constantly complaining, but Sam Bernstein was an exception. Paige admired his courage and his dignity. He had a wife and two grown sons who visited him regularly, and Paige had grown fond of them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been put on life-support systems with a note, DNR - Do Not Resuscitate - if his heart stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige walked into his room, a nurse was at the bedside. She looked up as Paige entered. \"He\u0027s gone, doctor. I didn\u0027t start emergency procedures, because ...\" Her voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right not to,\" Paige said slowly. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything I ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll make the arrangements.\" Paige stood by the bedside and looked down at the body of what had been a living, laughing human being, a man who had a family and friends, someone who had spent his life working hard, taking care of the ones he loved. And now ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to the drawer where he kept his possessions. There was an inexpensive watch, a set of keys, fifteen dollars in cash, dentures, and a letter to his wife. All that remained of a man\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was unable to shake the feeling of depression that hung over her. \"He was such a dear man. Why ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat said, \"Paige, you can\u0027t let yourself get emotionally involved with your patients. It will tear you apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. You\u0027re right, Kat. It\u0027s just that ... it\u0027s over so quickly, isn\u0027t it? This morning he and I were talking. Tomorrow is his funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not thinking of going to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funeral took place at the Hills of Eternity Cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Jewish religion, burial must take place as soon as possible following the death, and the service usually takes place the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body of Sam Bernstein was dressed in a takhrik-him, a white robe, and wrapped in a talit. The family was gathered around the graveside. The rabbi was intoning, \"Hamakom y\u0027nathaim etkhem b\u0027tokh sh\u0027ar availai tziyon veeyerushalayim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man standing next to Paige saw the puzzled expression on her face, and he translated for her. \" \u0027May the Lord comfort you with all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Paige\u0027s astonishment, the members of the family began tearing at the clothes they were wearing as they chanted, \"Baruch ata adonai elohainu me lech haolam dayan ha-emet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s to show respect,\" the man whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From dust you are and to dust you have returned, but the spirit returns to God who gave it.\" The ceremony was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Kat ran into Honey in the corridor. Honey looked nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything wrong?\" Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Wallace sent for me. He asked me to be in his office at two o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I messed up at rounds the other day. Dr. Ritter is a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can be,\" Kat said. \"But I\u0027m sure everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so. I just have a bad feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePromptly at two o\u0027clock, she arrived at Benjamin Wallace\u0027s office, carrying a small jar of honey in her purse. The receptionist was at lunch. Dr. Wallace\u0027s door was open. \"Come in, Dr. Taft,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney walked into his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close the door behind you, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney sat down across from him. She was almost trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenjamin Wallace looked across at her and thought, It\u0027s like kicking a puppy. But what has to be done has to be done. \"I\u0027m afraid I have some unfortunate news for you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour later, Honey met Kat in the solarium. Honey sank into a chair next to her, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see Dr. Wallace?\" Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. We had a long talk. Did you know that his wife left him last September? They were married for fifteen years. He has two grown children from an earlier marriage, but he hardly ever sees them. The poor darling is so lonely.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-14.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
