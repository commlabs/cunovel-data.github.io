Wonderful news? To bring another child into a loveless marriage was impossible. Margaret could no longer bear the humiliation. She would have to find a way out, and even as she was thinking it, she felt a sudden wave of nausea that left her drenched in perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Teeger was saying, \"Morning sickness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed her some pills. \"Take these. They\u0027ll help. You\u0027re in excellent condition, Mrs. McGregor. Not a thing to worry about. You run along home and tell the good news to your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said dully. \"I\u0027ll do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were at the dinner table when she said, \"I saw the doctor today. I\u0027m going to have a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Jamie threw down his napkin, arose from his chair and stormed out of the room. That was the moment when Margaret learned she could hate Jamie McGregor as deeply as she could love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a difficult pregnancy, and Margaret spent much of the time in bed, weak and tired. She lay there hour after hour, fantasizing, visualizing Jamie at her feet, begging for forgiveness, making wild love to her again. But they were only fantasies. The reality was that she was trapped. She had nowhere to go, and even if she could leave, he would never allow her to take her son with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was seven now, a healthy, handsome boy with a quick mind and a sense of humor. He had drawn closer to his mother, as though somehow sensing the unhappiness in her. He made little gifts for her in school and brought them home, and Margaret would smile and thank him and try to lift herself out of her depression. When young Jamie asked why his father stayed away nights and never took her out, Margaret would reply, \"Your father is a very important man, Jamie, doing important things, and he\u0027s very busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s between his father and me is my problem, Margaret thought, and I\u0027ll not have Jamie hating his father because of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret\u0027s pregnancy became more and more apparent. When she went out on the street, acquaintances would stop her and say, \"It won\u0027t be long now, will it, Mrs. McGregor? I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s going to be a fine boy like little Jamie. Your husband must be a happy man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her back, they said, \"Poor thing. She\u0027s lookin\u0027 peaked - she must have found out about the whore he\u0027s taken as his mistress...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret tried to prepare young Jamie for the new arrival. \"You\u0027re going to have a new brother or sister, darling. Then you\u0027ll have someone to play with all the time. Won\u0027t that be nice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie hugged her and said, \"It will be more company for you, Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Margaret fought to keep back the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe labor pains began at four o\u0027clock in the morning. Mrs. Talley sent for Hannah, and the baby was delivered at noon. It was a healthy baby girl, with her mother\u0027s mouth and her father\u0027s chin, and black hair curling around her little red face. Margaret named her Kate. It\u0027s a good, strong name, Margaret thought. And she\u0027s going to need her strength. We all are. I\u0027ve got to take the children away from here. I don\u0027t know how yet, but I must find a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Blackwell burst into Jamie McGregor\u0027s office without knocking, and Jamie looked up in surprise. \"What the hell - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re rioting at the Namib!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie stood up. \"What? What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the black boys was caught trying to steal a diamond. He cut a hole under his armpit and hid the stone inside it. As a lesson, Hans Zimmerman flogged him in front of the other workers. The boy died. He was twelve years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s face filled with rage. \"Sweet Jesus! I ordered a stop to flogging at all the mines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warned Zimmerman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get rid of the bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blacks have him. The situation\u0027s out of control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie grabbed his hat. \"Stay here and take care of things until I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s safe for you to go up there, Mr. McGregor. The native that Zimmerman killed was from the Barolong tribe. They don\u0027t forgive, and they don\u0027t forget. I could - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jamie was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jamie McGregor was ten miles away from the diamond field, he could see the smoke. All the huts at the Namib had been set to the torch. The damned fools! Jamie thought. They\u0027re burning their own houses. As his carriage drew closer, he heard the sounds of gunshots and screams. Amid the mass confusion, uniformed constables were shooting at blacks and coloreds who were desperately trying to flee. The whites were outnumbered ten to one, but they had the weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the chief constable, Bernard Sothey, saw Jamie McGregor, he hurried up to him and said, \"Don\u0027t worry, Mr. McGregor. We\u0027ll get every last one of the bastards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell you will,\" Jamie cried. \"Order your men to stop shooting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? If we - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do as I say!\" Jamie watched, sick with rage, as a black woman fell under a hail of bullets. \"Call your men off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, sir.\" The chief constable gave orders to an aide, and three minutes later all shooting had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were bodies on the ground everywhere. \"If you want my advice,\" Sothey said, \"I\u0027d - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want your advice. Bring me their leader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo policemen brought a young black up to where Jamie was standing. He was handcuffed and covered with blood, but there was no fear in him. He stood tall and straight, his eyes blazing, and Jamie remembered Banda\u0027s word for Bantu pride: isiko.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Jamie McGregor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened here was not my doing. I want to make it up to your men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell that to their widows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie turned to Sothey. \"Where\u0027s Hans Zimmerman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re still looking for him, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie saw the gleam in the black man\u0027s eyes, and he knew that Hans Zimmerman was not going to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to the man, \"I\u0027m closing the diamond field down for three days. I want you to talk to your people. Make a list of your complaints, and I\u0027ll look at it. I promise you I\u0027ll be fair. I\u0027ll change everything here that\u0027s not right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man studied him, a look of skepticism on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be a new foreman in charge here, and decent working conditions. But I\u0027ll expect your men back at work in three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief constable said, incredulously, \"You mean you\u0027re gonna let him go? He killed some of my men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be a full investigation, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the sound of a horse galloping toward them, and Jamie turned. It was David Blackwell, and the unexpected sight of him sounded an alarm in Jamie\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid leaped off his horse. \"Mr. McGregor, your son has disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world suddenly grew cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the population of Klipdrift turned out to join in the search. They covered the countryside, looking through gulleys, ravines and klops. There was no trace of the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was like a man possessed. He\u0027s wandered away somewhere, that\u0027s all. He\u0027ll be back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went into Margaret\u0027s bedroom. She was lying in bed, nursing the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there any news?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, but I\u0027ll find him.\" He looked at his baby daughter for an instant, then turned and walked out without another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Talley came into the room, twisting her hands in her apron. \"Don\u0027t you worry, Mrs. McGregor. Jamie is a big boy. He knows how to take care of himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret\u0027s eyes were blinded by tears. No one would harm little Jamie, would they? Of course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Talley reached down and took Kate from Margaret\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the baby into the nursery and laid her down in her crib. Kate was looking up at her, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better get some sleep too, little one. You\u0027ve got a busy life ahead of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Talley walked out of the room, closing the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt midnight, the bedroom window silently slid open and a man climbed into the room. He walked over to the crib, threw a blanket over the infant\u0027s head and scooped her up in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanda was gone as quickly as he had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Mrs. Talley who discovered that Kate was missing. Her first thought was that Mrs. McGregor had come in the night and taken her. She walked into Margaret\u0027s bedroom and asked, \"Where\u0027s the baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd from the look on Margaret\u0027s face, she knew instantly what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs another day went by with no trace of his son, Jamie was on the verge of collapsing. He approached David Blackwell. \"You don\u0027t think anything bad has happened to him?\" His voice was barely under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid tried to sound convincing. \"I\u0027m sure not, Mr. McGregor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was sure. He had warned Jamie McGregor that the Bantus neither forgave nor forgot, and it was a Bantu who had been cruelly murdered. David was certain of one thing: If the Bantus had taken little Jamie, he had died a horrible death, for they would exact their vengeance in kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie returned home at dawn, drained. He had led a search party of townspeople, diggers and constables, and they had spent the night looking without success in every conceivable place for the young boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was waiting when Jamie walked into the study. David rose to his feet. \"Mr. McGregor, your daughter has been kidnapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie stared at him in silence, his face pale. Then he turned and walked into his bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie had not been to bed for forty-eight hours, and he fell into bed, utterly exhausted, and slept. He was under the shade of a large baobab tree and in the distance across the trackless veld a lion was moving toward him. Young Jamie was shaking him. Wake up, Papa, a lion is coming. The animal was moving toward them faster now. His son was shaking him harder. Wake up! Jamie opened his eyes. Banda was standing over him. Jamie started to speak, but Banda put a hand over Jamie\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet!\" He allowed Jamie to sit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s my son?\" Jamie demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room began to spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I was too late to stop them. Your people spilled Bantu blood. My people demanded vengeance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie buried his face in his hands. \"Oh, my God! What did they do to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bottomless sorrow in Banda\u0027s voice. \"They left him out in the desert. I - I found his body and buried him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no! Oh, please, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to save him, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie slowly nodded, accepting it. Then dully, \"What about my daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took her away before they could get her. She\u0027s back in her bedroom, asleep. She\u0027ll be all right if you do what you promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie looked up, and his face was a mask of hatred. \"I\u0027ll keep my promise. But I want the men who killed my son. They\u0027re going to pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanda said quietly, \"Then you will have to kill my whole tribe, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanda was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only a nightmare, but she kept her eyes tightly closed, because she knew if she opened them the nightmare would become real and her children would be dead. So she played a game. She would keep her eyes squeezed shut until she felt little Jamie\u0027s hand on hers saying, \"It\u0027s all right, Mother. We\u0027re here. We\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been in bed for three days, refusing to talk to anyone or see anyone. Dr. Teeger came and went, and Margaret was not even aware of it. In the middle of the night Margaret was lying in bed with her eyes shut when she heard a loud crash from her son\u0027s room. She opened her eyes and listened. There was another sound. Little Jamie was back!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret hurriedly got out of bed and ran down the corridor toward the closed door of her son\u0027s room. Through the door, she could hear strange animal sounds. Her heart pounding wildly, she pushed the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband lay on the floor, his face and body contorted. One eye was closed and the other stared up at her grotesquely. He was trying to speak, and the words came out as slobbering animal sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret whispered, \"Oh, Jamie - Jamie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Teeger said, \"I\u0027m afraid the news is bad, Mrs. McGregor. Your husband has had a severe stroke. There\u0027s a fifty-fifty chance he\u0027ll live - but if he does, he\u0027ll be a vegetable. I\u0027ll make arrangements to get him into a private sanitarium where he can get the proper care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Margaret in surprise. \"No...what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No hospital. I want him here with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor considered for a moment. \"All right. You\u0027ll need a nurse. I\u0027ll arrange - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want a nurse. I\u0027ll take care of Jamie myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Teeger shook his head. \"That won\u0027t be possible, Mrs. McGregor. You don\u0027t know what\u0027s involved. Your husband is no longer a functioning human being. He\u0027s completely paralyzed and will be for as long as he lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret said, \"I\u0027ll take care of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Jamie finally, truly, belonged to her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-11.html","bookId":2358,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM"}
