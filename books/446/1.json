I asked him if he really thought a knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages an essential requisite to a good education. JOHNSON. \u0027Most certainly, Sir; for those who know them have a very great advantage over those who do not. Nay, Sir, it is wonderful what a difference learning makes upon people even in the common intercourse of life, which does not appear to be much connected with it.\u0027 \u0027And yet, (said I) people go through the world very well, and carry on the business of life to good advantage, without learning.\u0027 JOHNSON. \u0027Why, Sir, that may be true in cases where learning cannot possibly be of any use; for instance, this boy rows us as well without learning, as if he could sing the song of Orpheus to the Argonauts, who were the first sailors.\u0027 He then called to the boy, \u0027What would you give my lad, to know about the Argonauts?\u0027 \u0027Sir, (said the boy) I would give what I have.\u0027 Johnson was much pleased with his answer, and we gave him a double fare. Dr. Johnson then turning to me, \u0027Sir, (said he) a desire of knowledge is the natural feeling of mankind; and every human being, whose mind is not debauched, will be willing to give all that he has, to get knowledge.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e —James Boswell,\n\u003cbr\u003e The Life of Samuel Johnson, L.
