As are a number of guards-primarily those in the Patriotist compound, and at least two bodyguards to the Chancellor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Has that damned snake turned suicidal as well?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It almost seems so, Barrakta,’ Rautos conceded. ‘All very troubling-especially Karos Invictad’s reluctance to be forthcoming on what exactly happened. The only hint I possess of just how extreme events were last night is a rumour that Karos was beaten, nearly to death. I cannot confirm that rumour, since he was seeing no-one, and besides, no doubt healers visited in the aftermath.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rautos,’ murmured Druz, ‘do we need to distance ourselves from the Patriotists?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is worth considering,’ Rautos replied. ‘You might wish to begin preparations in that regard. In the meantime, however, we need the Patriotists, but I admit to worry that they may prove lacking come the day we most need their services.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hire our own,’ Barrakta said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have done so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp nods answered this quiet statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUster Taran cleared his throat. ‘My apologies, Rautos. You proceed on matters with your usual assurance. I regret my doubt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As ever,’ Rautos said, reaching once more for the cloth and wiping his hands, ‘I welcome discourse. Indeed, even challenge. Lest I grow careless. Now, we need to assess the health of our own holdings, to give us all a better indication of our resilience…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the meeting continued, Rautos wiped at his hands again and again. A corpse had snagged on one of the mooring poles opposite the estate’s landing this morning. Bloated and rotting, crawling with crayfish and seething with eels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn occasional occurrence, but one that each time struck him with greater force, especially in the last few years. This morning it had been particularly bad, and though he had approached no closer than the uppermost tier in his yard, still it was as if some residue had reached him, making his hands oddly sticky-a residue that he seemed unable to remove, no matter how hard he tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e¦ ¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.. ¦ -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe One God strode out-a puppet trailing severed strings-from the conflagration. Another city destroyed, another people cut down in their tens of thousands. Who among us, witnessing his emergence, could not but conclude that madness had taken him? For all the power of creation he possessed, he delivered naught but death and destruction. Stealer of Life, Slayer and Reaper, in his eyes where moments earlier there had been the blaze of unreasoning rage, now there was calm. He knew nothing. He could not resolve the blood on his own hands. He begged us for answers, but we could say nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could weep. We could laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chose laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– Creed of the Mockers Cabal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s play a game, the wind whispered. Then it laughed in the soft hiss of dust and sand. Hedge sat, listening, the crumbly stone block beneath him eroded into a saddle shape, comforting enough, all things considered. It might have been an altar once, fallen through some hole in the sky-Hood knew, enough strange objects had tumbled down from the low, impenetrable clouds during his long, meandering journey across this dire world. Some of them far too close for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, probably an altar. The depression wherein resided his behind felt too even, too symmetrical to be natural. But he did not worry about blasphemy-this was, after all, where the dead went. And the dead included, on occasion, gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind told him as much. It had been his companion for so long, now, he had grown accustomed to its easy revelations, its quiet rasp of secrets and its caressing embrace. When he stumbled onto a scatter of enormous bones, hinting at some unhuman, monstrous god of long ago, the wind-as it slipped down among those bones, seeped between jutting ribs and slithered through orbitals and into the hollow caves of skulls-moaned that god’s once-holy name. Names. It seemed they had so many, their utterances now and for ever more trapped in the wind’s domain. Voiced in the swirl of dust, nothing but echoes now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s play a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no gate-oh, you’ve seen it, I well know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it is a lie. It is what your mind builds, stone by stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor your kind love borders. Thresholds, divisions, delineations. To enter a place you believe you must leave another. But look around and you can see. There is no gate, my jriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI show you this. Again and again. The day you comprehend, the day wisdom comes to you, you will join me. The flesh that encompasses you is your final conceit. Abandon it, my love. You once scattered yourself and you will do so again. When wisdom arrives. Has wisdom arrived yet? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-135.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
