{"id":42238,"no":98,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 44","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when Cide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not translate it as he wrote it — that is, as a kind of complaint the Moor made against himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little variety as this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced to speak perpetually of him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in digressions and episodes more serious and more interesting. He said, too, that to go on, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject, and speaking through the mouths of a few characters, was intolerable drudgery, the result of which was never equal to the author’s labour, and that to avoid this he had in the First Part availed himself of the device of novels, like “The Ill-advised Curiosity,” and “The Captive Captain,” which stand, as it were, apart from the story; the others are given there being incidents which occurred to Don Quixote himself and could not be omitted. He also thought, he says, that many, engrossed by the interest attaching to the exploits of Don Quixote, would take none in the novels, and pass them over hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance and art of their composition, which would be very manifest were they published by themselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of Don Quixote or the simplicities of Sancho. Therefore in this Second Part he thought it best not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but only episodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances the facts present; and even these sparingly, and with no more words than suffice to make them plain; and as he confines and restricts himself to the narrow limits of the narrative, though he has ability; capacity, and brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he requests that his labours may not be despised, and that credit be given him, not alone for what he writes, but for what he has refrained from writing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave the counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to him in writing so that he might get some one to read them to him. They had scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop, and they fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don Quixote. To carry on the joke, then, the same evening they despatched Sancho with a large following to the village that was to serve him for an island. It happened that the person who had him in charge was a majordomo of the duke’s , a man of great discretion and humour — and there can be no humour without discretion — and the same who played the part of the Countess Trifaldi in the comical way that has been already described; and thus qualified, and instructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he carried out their scheme admirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as Sancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of the Trifaldi, and turning to his master, he said to him, “Senor, either the devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing, or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the duke’s here is the very face of the Distressed One.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDon Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, said to Sancho, “There is no reason why the devil should carry thee off, Sancho, either righteous or believing — and what thou meanest by that I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the majordomo, but for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One; for his being so would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for going into questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in an inextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we must pray earnestly to our Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It is no joke, senor,” said Sancho, “for before this I heard him speak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi was sounding in my ears. Well, I’ll hold my peace; but I’ll take care to be on the look-out henceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm or do away with this suspicion.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Thou wilt do well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and thou wilt let me know all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thy government.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. He was dressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet over all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la gineta upon a mule. Behind him, in accordance with the duke’s orders, followed Dapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and from time to time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so well pleased to have him with him that he would not have changed places with the emperor of Germany. On taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke and duchess and got his master’s blessing, which Don Quixote gave him with tears, and he received blubbering.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, Gentle Reader; and look out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he behaved himself in office will give thee. In the meantime turn thy attention to what happened his master the same night, and if thou dost not laugh thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for Don Quixote’s adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felt his loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate and take away the government from him he would have done so. The duchess observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy; because, she said, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were squires, duennas, and damsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The truth is, senora,” replied Don Quixote, “that I do feel the loss of Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all the offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will with which they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of your excellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that must not be; four of my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“To me,” said Don Quixote, “they will not be flowers, but thorns to pierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter my chamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still further, though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations and my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I will sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Say no more, Senor Don Quixote, say no more,” said the duchess; “I assure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel, shall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine the propriety of Senor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues the one that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship may undress and dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you please, for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber you will find all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who sleeps with his door locked, to the end that no natural needs compel you to open it. May the great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousand years, and may her fame extend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves to be loved by a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven infuse zeal into the heart of our governor Sancho Panza to finish off his discipline speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a lady.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo which Don Quixote replied, “Your highness has spoken like what you are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcinea will be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of your highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth could bestow upon her.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Well, well, Senor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, is nearly supper-time, and the duke is is probably waiting; come let us go to supper, and retire to rest early, for the journey you made yesterday from Kandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused you some fatigue.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I feel none, senora,” said Don Quixote, “for I would go so far as to swear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounted a quieter beast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavileno; and I don’t know what could have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle, and burn it so recklessly as he did.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Probably,” said the duchess, “repenting of the evil he had done to the Trifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he must have committed as a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away with all the instruments of his craft; and so burned Clavileno as the chief one, and that which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land; and by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great Don Quixote of La Mancha is established for ever.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDon Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped, retired to his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to wait on him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that might lead or drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady Dulcinea; for he had always present to his mind the virtue of Amadis, that flower and mirror of knights-errant. He locked the door behind him, and by the light of two wax candles undressed himself, but as he was taking off his stockings — O disaster unworthy of such a personage! — there came a burst, not of sighs, or anything belying his delicacy or good breeding, but of some two dozen stitches in one of his stockings, that made it look like a window-lattice. The worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at that moment he would have given an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silk there; I say green silk, because the stockings were green.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, “O poverty, poverty! I know not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee ‘holy gift ungratefully received.’ Although a Moor, I know well enough from the intercourse I have had with Christians that holiness consists in charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all that, I say he must have a great deal of godliness who can find any satisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty one of their greatest saints refers to, saying, ‘possess all things as though ye possessed them not;’ which is what they call poverty in spirit. But thou, that other poverty — for it is of thee I am speaking now — why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of good birth more than with other people? Why dost thou compel them to smear the cracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, one silk, another hair, and another glass? Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?” (From this we may perceive the antiquity of starch and crimped ruffs.) Then he goes on: “Poor gentleman of good family! always cockering up his honour, dining miserably and in secret, and making a hypocrite of the toothpick with which he sallies out into the street after eating nothing to oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say, with his nervous honour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his shoe, the sweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and the hunger of his stomach!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his stitches; however, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had left behind a pair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the next day. At last he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because he missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings, the stitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can show in the course of his never-failing embarrassments. He put out the candles; but the night was warm and he could not sleep; he rose from his bed and opened slightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful garden, and as he did so he perceived and heard people walking and talking in the garden. He set himself to listen attentively, and those below raised their voices so that he could hear these words:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but only weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and I would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and even if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain, if this strange AEneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me, sleeps on and wakens not to hear it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Heed not that, dear Altisidora,” replied a voice; “the duchess is no doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the grated window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the duchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“That is not the point, Emerencia,” replied Altisidora, “it is that I would not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in the heart;” and here a harp softly touched made itself heard. As he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathless amazement, for immediately the countless adventures like this, with windows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings, that he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind. He at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess’s was in love with him, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. He trembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution not to yield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady Dulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them know he was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should hear them. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand across the strings, began this ballad:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eO thou that art above in bed,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBetween the holland sheets,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA-lying there from night till morn,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith outstretched legs asleep;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eO thou, most valiant knight of all\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe famed Manchegan breed,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf purity and virtue more\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThan gold of Araby;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGive ear unto a suffering maid,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell-grown but evil-starr’d,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor those two suns of thine have lit\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA fire within her heart.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAdventures seeking thou dost rove,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo others bringing woe;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo heal them dost withhold!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSay, valiant youth, and so may God\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThy enterprises speed,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDidst thou the light mid Libya’s sands\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr Jaca’s rocks first see?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDid scaly serpents give thee suck?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWho nursed thee when a babe?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWert cradled in the forest rude,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr gloomy mountain cave?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eO Dulcinea may be proud,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat plump and lusty maid;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor she alone hath had the power\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA tiger fierce to tame.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd she for this shall famous be\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom Tagus to Jarama,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom Manzanares to Genil,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom Duero to Arlanza.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFain would I change with her, and give\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA petticoat to boot,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe best and bravest that I have,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll trimmed with gold galloon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eO for to be the happy fair\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThy mighty arms enfold,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr even sit beside thy bed\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd scratch thy dusty poll!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI rave, — to favours such as these\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUnworthy to aspire;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThy feet to tickle were enough\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor one so mean as I.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat caps, what slippers silver-laced,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWould I on thee bestow!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat damask breeches make for thee;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat fine long holland cloaks!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd I would give thee pearls that should\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs big as oak-galls show;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo matchless big that each might well\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBe called the great “Alone.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eManchegan Nero, look not down\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom thy Tarpeian Rock\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUpon this burning heart, nor add\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe fuel of thy wrath.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA virgin soft and young am I,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot yet fifteen years old;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e(I’m only three months past fourteen,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI swear upon my soul).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI hobble not nor do I limp,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll blemish I’m without,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I walk my lily locks\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre trailing on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd though my nose be rather flat,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd though my mouth be wide,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth like topazes exalt\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy beauty to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThou knowest that my voice is sweet,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is if thou dost hear;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am moulded in a form\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat below the mean.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese charms, and many more, are thine,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSpoils to thy spear and bow all;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA damsel of this house am I,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy name Altisidora.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while the warmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he said to himself, “O that I should be such an unlucky knight that no damsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! O that the peerless Dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy my incomparable constancy in peace! What would ye with her, ye queens? Why do ye persecute her, ye empresses? Why ye pursue her, ye virgins of from fourteen to fifteen? Leave the unhappy being to triumph, rejoice and glory in the lot love has been pleased to bestow upon her in surrendering my heart and yielding up my soul to her. Ye love-smitten host, know that to Dulcinea only I am dough and sugar-paste, flint to all others; for her I am honey, for you aloes. For me Dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise, virtuous, graceful, and high-bred, and all others are ill-favoured, foolish, light, and low-born. Nature sent me into the world to be hers and no other’s ; Altisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake they belaboured me in the castle of the enchanted Moor may give way to despair, but I must be Dulcinea’s , boiled or roast, pure, courteous, and chaste, in spite of all the magic-working powers on earth.” And with that he shut the window with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of sorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him, stretched himself on his bed, where we will leave him for the present, as the great Sancho Panza, who is about to set up his famous government, now demands our attention.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e据说小说作者锡德·哈迈德写的这章，译者没有照原文翻译。锡德·哈迈德对自己总是干巴巴地局限于唐吉诃德不满意，因为这样就总得写唐吉诃德和桑乔，而不能扩展到其他更严肃或者更风趣的故事上去。他觉得总是把自己的心思、手和笔集中在一个题目上，而且总是叙述那么几个人，简直让人难以承受，而且读者也不满意。为了避免这个缺陷，他在上卷里采取了穿插几个故事的手法，例如《无谓的猜疑》和《被俘虏的上尉》。那两个故事与这部小说没有什么联系，可是其他故事却与唐吉诃德相关，所以不能不写。作者还说，他估计很多人只注意唐吉诃德的事迹，而忽视了那些故事，匆匆带过，或者读起来满心不快，却没有注意到故事本身所包含的深刻内涵。如果把这些故事单独出版，不与疯癫的唐吉诃德和愚蠢的桑乔交织在一起，就容易发现它们的深刻含义了。所以在下卷里，作者不准备采用故事，无论它们与本书有关还是无关，而是记述一些从本书事件中衍生出来的情节，并且要语言精炼。虽然语言不多，但是作者的能力、才干和智慧足以描述世间的一切。作者请人们不要忽略了他的良苦用心，别只是对他写出的东西加以赞扬，而且要注意到他没有写出来的东西。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e言归正传。那天唐吉诃德开导完桑乔，就去吃饭了。吃完饭，他又把自己的话写了下来，让桑乔以后找人给他念。可是，桑乔刚拿到这几张纸就把它丢了，结果落到了公爵手里。公爵又告诉了公爵夫人。他们不禁再次对唐吉诃德的疯癫和聪慧感到意外，于是决定把这个玩笑继续下去。当天下午，他们派了不少人陪着桑乔到了准备让桑乔当总督的地方，而领队的就是公爵的管家。这个人很机灵，也很风趣，他若是不机灵也就不会风趣了，刚才说的那个“三摆裙夫人”就是他装扮的。管家已从主人处得知应当如何对付桑乔，结果扮演得十分成功。且说桑乔一见到管家，就觉得他的脸同忧伤妇人的脸完全一样，便转身对唐吉诃德说道：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“大人，看来我又见到鬼了。不过，您恐怕也得承认，这位管家的这张脸就是忧伤妇人那张脸。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e唐吉诃德仔细看了看管家，看完后对桑乔说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“没必要让你见什么鬼，桑乔，我不明白你的意思。即使忧伤妇人的脸像管家的脸，那也不等于说管家就是忧伤妇人。如果他们同是一个人，那问题就太复杂了。现在不是弄清这个问题的时候，那会把我们弄湖涂的。相信我吧，朋友，现在需要我们十分虔诚地请求上帝，把我们俩从巫师和魔法师的恶作剧里解脱出来。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“这并不是开玩笑，大人。”桑乔说，“刚才我听他说话，就仿佛是三摆裙夫人在我耳边说话似的。那好吧，我不说了，不过我会从现在起开始留心，看是否会发现什么迹象来证实或者否定我的怀疑。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“你这样做就对了，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“无论你发现什么情况，还有你当总督时遇到的各种情况，都要及时告诉我。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e桑乔终于在众人的簇拥下出门了。他打扮成文官的样子，又披了一件很宽大的棕黄色羽纱风衣，头戴一顶用同样面料制作的帽子，骑着骡子，后面跟随着他的驴。按照公爵的吩咐，驴已经配备了鞍具和发亮的丝绸饰品。桑乔不时回头看看他的驴。有这么多人簇拥着他，他感到十分得意，这时候就是让他去做德国的皇帝，他也不会去了。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e桑乔向公爵和公爵夫人告别，又接受了唐吉诃德的祝福。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e唐吉诃德祝福时眼含热泪，桑乔也是一副哭相。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e亲爱的读者，让桑乔一路平安，事事如意吧。你若是知道了他后来在总督职位上的行为，准会笑个不停的。现在，且看看唐吉诃德那天晚上所做的事吧。你看了即使没有笑出声，也会像猴子一样把嘴咧开！唐吉诃德那天晚上做的事真是让人既惊奇又好笑。据记载，那天桑乔刚走，唐吉诃德就感觉到孤独。如果可能的话，他肯定会让公爵收回成命，不叫桑乔去当总督了。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e公爵夫人见唐吉诃德郁郁不乐，便问他为什么不高兴。如果是因为桑乔不在的缘故，那么，公爵家里的侍从、女佣和侍女都可以供他使唤，保证让他称心如意。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“的确是因为桑乔不在的缘故，夫人。”唐吉诃德说，“不过，这并不是我看起来郁郁不乐的主要原因。您对我的关怀，我只能心领了。我请求您让我在自己的房间里自己照顾自己。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“可不能这样，”公爵夫人说，“我这儿有四个侍女可供您使唤，她们个个都花容月貌。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“对于我来说，”唐吉诃德说，“她们并非花容月貌，而是如芒在背。让她们进入我的房间，那绝对不行。您是关怀我，可我不该享受这种关怀，您还是让我自便吧。我宁愿在我的欲望和贞操之间建起一道城墙，也不愿意由于您对我的关怀而失去贞操。我宁可和衣而睡，也不愿意让别人给我脱衣服。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“别再说了，唐吉诃德大人。”公爵夫人说，“我会吩咐的，别说是一个侍女，就是一只母苍蝇也休想进入您的房间。我可不是那种人，让唐吉诃德大人您败坏自己的尊严。我已经意识到了，贞操是您诸多美德中最突出的一点。您可以在房间里自个儿关着门，随时任意脱衣服和穿衣服，绝对没有人来阻拦您。您可以在房间里找到各种必要的器皿，即使您要方便也不必出门。让托博索的杜尔西内亚长命百岁，让她的芳名传遍整个大地吧，只有她才配被如此英勇、如此自重的骑士所爱。让仁慈的老天催促我们的桑乔总督尽早完成他的鞭笞苦行，好让世人重新欣赏到如此伟大的夫人的美貌吧。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e唐吉诃德说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“高贵的夫人说起话来真是恰如其分，善良的夫人讲起话来从来不会有任何恶意。而世界上最幸运的人当属杜尔西内亚，因为她竟受到了您的赞扬。在她受到的各种赞扬里，唯有您的赞扬最有分量。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“那么好吧，唐吉诃德大人，”公爵夫人说，“已经是吃晚饭的时候了，公爵大概正在等咱们呢。请您同我们一起吃晚饭，然后您就早点睡觉吧。昨天的坎达亚之行可不近，您大概也累了。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“我一点儿也没感到累，夫人。”唐吉诃德说，“我可以向您发誓，我平生从未骑过‘轻木销’这样平稳的马。我真不明白马兰布鲁诺凭什么把如此轻盈、如此英俊的马无缘无故地烧掉。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“这很容易理解。”公爵夫人说，“作为巫师和魔法师，他已经对三摆裙夫人及其一行还有其他人做了孽，后来他后悔了，想毁掉他这个做孽的主要工具。就是这匹木马带着他到处奔波，所以他把木马烧了。随着木马燃烧留下的灰烬和由此建立的丰碑，曼查的伟大骑士唐吉诃德的英名将与世长存。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e唐吉诃德再次对公爵夫人表示感谢。吃完晚饭后，唐吉诃德回到房间里，只身一人。他不许任何人进去服侍他，以免遇到什么情况使他身不由己地失掉对他的杜尔西内亚夫人的忠贞。他的脑子里时刻不忘游侠骑士的精英阿马迪斯的美德。他随手关上门，借着两支蜡烛的光线脱衣服。真糟糕，像他这样正统的人真不该遇到这种不正统的事——不是什么污染房间空气的排放秽气之类的事，而是在他脱袜子的时候有一只袜子上出现了几十个洞，简直成了网状。唐吉诃德懊丧极了，他宁愿花一盎司银子去换一点儿绿色绸布。要绿色绸布是因为他那双袜子是绿色的。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e贝嫩赫利写到这里惊叹道：“贫困啊贫困，我不明白为什么那位科尔多瓦大诗人会称你为：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e未受答谢的神圣礼品！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我虽为摩尔人，但通过同基督徒们的交往，我得知基督教的神圣之处就在于仁慈、谦逊、信念、恭顺和贫困。尽管如此，我还是认为甘于贫困更接近于圣德，只要不是那种圣人所说的‘置买了财产却好像一无所有’①，即人们所称的精神贫困就行。我说的这另一种贫困啊，你为什么偏偏跟一些破落贵族和有身份的人过不去呢？你为什么总是让他们的鞋上裂口子，让他们的衣服扣子有的是丝绸的，有的是鬃的，有的是玻璃的呢？为什么让他们大部分人的衣领总是皱皱巴巴，而不是挺括的衣领呢？（由此可见，以前就开始时兴上浆的衣领了。）那些可怜的有身份的人，为了炫耀自己的身份，在家里偷偷地胡乱吃一些东西，牙齿间并没有什么可剔之物，可是走到大街上却要装模作样地剔牙！这种人真可怜，为了那一点点体面，总怕别人从一里之外就能看到那带补丁的鞋、帽上的汗渍、短短的斗篷和饥肠辘辘的样子！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e①参见《新约全书》的《哥林多前书》第七章第三十节。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e唐吉诃德见袜子上开了线，烦恼起来，但他看到桑乔留下了一双旅行靴，又放下心来。他想，第二天就穿这双靴子。最后，他上床躺下，心事重重，又闷闷不乐，这一方面是因为桑乔不在的缘故，另一方面是因为那双倒霉的袜子。即使能用另外一种颜色的丝绸补上那双袜子，那也是一个破落贵族贫困潦倒的明显标志。他吹灭了蜡烛。天气很热，他不能入睡，于是起身把朝向花园的一扇窗户打开了一点儿。刚一打开窗户，他就感到有人在花园里走动，而且还听到有人在说话。他仔细谛听。说话人抬高了嗓门，他听到了这样的对话：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“别勉强我唱歌，埃梅伦西亚。你知道，自从那个外来人一到咱们城堡，我的眼睛看到了他，我就不会唱歌而只会哭了。况且，咱们的女主人睡觉很警醒，我不想让她知道咱们在这里。即使没有把她惊醒，若是我的那位令我心焦的埃涅阿斯没听见我唱的歌，那也是白唱呀。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“别这么想，亲爱的阿尔蒂西多拉。”另一个人说道，“公爵夫人和这儿的所有人肯定都睡熟了，只有那位令你心神不安的心上人还没有睡。我觉得房屋的窗户打开了，他肯定没有睡。可怜的痴情人，你就随着竖琴的伴奏低声婉唱吧，如果公爵夫人听到了，咱们就说天气热，睡不着。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“哎，你没说到点子上，埃梅伦西亚。”阿尔蒂西多拉说，“我不愿意让我的歌暴露我的心扉，让那些不了解爱情力量的人误以为我任性而又轻浮。但是不管怎样，我还是宁愿羞在脸上，也不愿意难受在心里。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e此时，竖琴非常悦耳地响了起来，唐吉诃德听到后不由得十分紧张。他立刻想到他在那些异想天开的骑士小说里看到的许多类似的情况，什么窗户、栅栏、花园、音乐、卿卿我我和异想天开等等。他马上意识到，一定是公爵夫人的某个侍女爱上了他，可是羞怯又迫使她把秘密埋藏在心底。唐吉诃德怕自己把持不住，心里告诫自己不能屈服。他一方面真心实意地祈求杜尔西内亚保佑自己度过这一关，另一方面又决定先听听乐曲，搞清楚到底是怎么回事。他装着打了个喷嚏。两个侍女听到了喷嚏声很高兴，她们就是希望让唐吉诃德听到她们的对话。阿尔蒂西多拉调好竖琴，唱起了这首歌谣：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e你铺盖着洁白的亚麻布哟，\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e躺在床上，\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e仰天大睡，\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e从天黑到天亮。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e你是曼查\u003c/p\u003e
