Fu Hongxue had already arrived at the main gate of the Ancient Monastery of the Celestial Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the dark grey monastery was constructed long ago, it still retained vestiges of its former glory and prestige. In the courtyard, there was an enormous thousand-jin copper cooking vessel, stained with rust. The stone steps were covered with moss as well. Although it did appear a bit gloomy and unfrequented, the grand, majestic main hall still towered like a mountain over the surroundings, and the pillars in the courtyard remained as strong and erect as a tiger’s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could such a strong, vigorous monastery suddenly collapse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The words of a crazy monk are naturally crazy words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a long time since the sacrificial altar in the main hall had enjoyed the scent of meat or burning joss sticks. But it was still lofty and high above, staring down at the ignorance and suffering of men. The corners of the hall were filled with cobwebs, and the old, shabby curtains fluttered hither and fro in the wind. There was neither sight nor sound of human being here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the one who rang the funeral bell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue silently stood in front of the statue of Buddha. In his heart, he suddenly felt an extremely strange feeling. He suddenly wanted to kneel down, kneel down before this Buddha, whose gilt skin had already begun to peel off. To beg for peace, peace for Zhuo Yuzhen and her children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time in his life he felt so pious. But he did not kneel down, because just at this time, a swishing sound came from outside of the main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turned his head, he saw a rainbow-colored, lightning-like flash of sabre light flickering outside. Where the sabre light flashed, those pillars in the courtyard, as strong and erect as a tiger’s spine, were severed. Swishing sounds continually entered the ear, and the mountain-like main hall began to tremble and way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inclined his head upwards, and immediately saw that the pillars and beams supporting the ceiling were beginning to slide down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words of that crazy monk weren’t just crazy words. After the dancing sabre light flashed across the main hall, this towering, millennia-old monastery truly did collapse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat type of sabre was that? How could it have such fearsome strength?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue tightly gripped his sabre!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sabre was a weapon beyond compare, but this sabre definitely didn’t have such a fearsome strength!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thundering sound, one corner of the main hall collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fu Hongxue did not collapse. The mountains might burst and the earth might split, but some people will never collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother corner of the main hall collapsed. Rubble and debris flew about as though propelled by wind. The swallows on the roof beams had long since flown away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fu Hongxue continued to stand there without moving!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, not only was the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch, that weapon which could anger gods and aggrieve demons, waiting for him, but also innumerable murderous plots and tricks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Decapitator Miao, you have a very fine sabre, but you yourself are a base creature. Why don’t you dare to stand face to face with me and fight to the death, and instead run around playing tricks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre light disappeared. Someone sneered from outside the main hall as well. “As long as you aren’t dead, come to the inner courtyard to meet me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter of the Heaven’s Monarch, the Demon Decapitator, sounded like the crying of ghosts. One word at a time, he continued, “I will definitely wait for you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will definitely wait for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact phrase, the exact six words. But coming from two different mouths, they had two totally different meanings!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment in time, Fu Hongxue suddenly thought of that girl who wore the jasmine flowers. He thought of how she fell to the ground, and of her eyes, filled with pain, sorrow, and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was also a person. No matter what type of person one was, they wouldn’t be willing to accept that sort of humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that all her life, she was destined to live in that crumbling, swaying room, without any road to take, and no path of escape, until debris and dirt covered her body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s hands tightened. He suddenly started walking out. He walked very slowly, and his gait still appeared painful and ugly. But since he began to walk, he definitely would not stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorway had collapsed. The flying dust covered his eyes, as he slowly walked past the broken pieces of wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother sound, akin to giant earthquakes and massive landslides. The center of the main hall had collapsed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebris and shattered pieces of wood collided into his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not look back. He didn’t even blink. This required not only an astonishing degree of composure, it also required an unshakable, fearless degree of courage! Precisely because he was composed, precisely because he had courage, he avoided the first trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he stepped foot over the main hall’s doorway, at least fifty or so hidden projectiles shot out at him from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had looked back in surprise, if he had lost his composure, he would have collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollapsed, just like this majestic monastery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourage and self-confidence are the pillars of a man, helping preserve humanity’s existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo long as these two pillars do not fall, mankind shall never be extinguished!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as these hidden projectiles were shot out, two rays of cold light shot out as well, intersecting. It was a sword and a hook!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s sabre had already left its sheath. With a slanted flash of sabre light, he scurried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t dare to stop and look back. He didn’t know how many other deadly ambushes were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe copper vessel in the courtyard was still there. His slender body shot out like a javelin, coming down just behind the copper vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gust of wind blew towards him. He felt it was as cold as a sabre’s chop on his shoulders. After looking down, he realized that a four-inch long wound had been left on his shoulder. The sword and the hook had launched an extremely swift and deadly assault. If someone hadn’t personally experienced the attack, they wouldn’t be able to imagine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood flowed from his shoulder. Blood flowed from his sabre as well. Whose blood was dripping from his sabre?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hook was naturally Gongsun Tu’s eagle-beak. But the sword was definitely not Yang Wuji’s ancient sword of Damascus steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sword was far faster, far more accurate, and far more fearful than Yang Wuji’s sword. In addition, Yang Wuji’s sword-arm had been cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wound on Fu Hongxue’s shoulder was a sword wound. Who had his sabre harmed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main hall seemed to have totally collapsed by now. Turning around, he didn’t see anybody at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the first strike does not land true, fully withdraw! This wasn’t just the rule of the Xingxiuhai sect. It was also the principle by which old veterans of the martial world followed without fail!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why didn’t that Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch appear again? With the first attack, he chopped the horse in half. With his second, he destroyed the great hall. Why didn’t he strike at Fu Hongxue? Was he really waiting for Fu Hongxue at the inner courtyard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inner courtyard was peaceful and secluded. But there wasn’t even a shadow here either. Within the verdant mulberry grove, there was someone singing light songs. The songs were soft and haunting, causing gloom and capable of extinguishing one’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three lit verandas in the grove. The doors and the windows were all open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as one entered the grove, one could see a giant who looked like a deity from heaven. He was squatting in front of a barbarian bed, his hair all tousled, tied together with a golden ribbon. On his body, he wore a golden embroidered robe. But beneath his waist, he wore a battle-kilt made from a tiger’s pelt. Light shone out of his panther-like eyes, and his bronze skin sparkled. He looked just like one of the titans, who existed when the heavens and the earth were first separated, or like an undefeatable god of war from the myths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour women with coifed hair and light garments were wrapped around his body. One was holding a golden cup and sitting on his knee. Another was combing his hair. A third was taking off his boots. The other was sitting far away beneath the window, and singing in a low voice. They came from the cart on which the Ghostly Granny had arrived in. Although they were no longer young, they had their own mature, graceful, womanly elegance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they weren’t mature women, how could they endure such a virile, healthy titan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stove burned in one corner of the room. A sabre was placed on the table. The handle of the sabre was one foot, three inches long. The blade was seven feet, nine inches long. There were many dazzling pearls sewn onto the beautiful shark-skin sheath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sabre was the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch? This man was Miao Tianwang, Heaven’s Monarch Miao?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stepped onto the leaves. He slowly made his way over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already saw this person. Although his features were still totally expressionless, every single nerve in his body had become taut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrength great enough to destroy a hall, and to cut a galloping horse in half, originally could only be found in fairytales. But now, it just so happened to appear right in front of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman singing a song beneath the window only turned to glance at him. Her song did not change, but it sounded even more dreary now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman holding the golden cup suddenly let out a sigh. “Why would a perfect good person, insist on coming here to die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman combing his hair coldly said, “Because even if he was alive, he wouldn’t be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the woman taking off his boots began to laugh. “I like to see people being killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman combing his hair said, “But it might not be good to see this person be killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman taking off his boots said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman combing his hair said, “Judging from his face, this person probably doesn’t have a drop of blood in his veins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman holding the golden cup said, “Even if he does, it’s probably cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman taking off his boots was still laughing. “Cold blood is better than no blood. I just want to see a little bit of blood. I’ve always been a very easily satisfied woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had already walked to the window. He stopped. It seemed as though he hadn’t heard a single word which they had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really hadn’t heard a single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he had already poured all of his attention and focus into this godlike titan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly asked, “Miao Tianwang?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang had already stretched out his massive hand, gripping the sabre on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “This is the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang coldly said, “Sometimes, it decapitates demons. Sometimes, it kills men. So long as the sabre leaves the sheath, no matter who the target is, he will die beneath its blade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang’s panther-like eyes revealed a trace of surprise. “Very good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Your sabre is already in your hand. My body is already beneath your sabre. Isn’t that very good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang laughed. “Very good. It truly is very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Unfortunately, I haven’t died yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang said, “Life and death have always been things which pass in the twinkling of an eye. I’m not in a rush. Why are you in a hurry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shut his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hilt of the sabre was wreathed in purple silk. It was the color of congealed blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang’s hand gently stroked the hilt of the sabre. He suddenly said, “Are you waiting for me to draw my sabre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang said, “The rumors of the martial world say that your sabre is a weapon which is fast beyond compare!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue didn’t deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang said, “Why don’t you draw first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because I want to see your sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I pull out my sabre, I’m afraid that your sabre will never have a chance to leave the sheath again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he didn’t say those words, his meaning was very obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang suddenly laughed loudly. He suddenly stood up, and the woman sitting on his knee immediately rolled off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, he towered at least nine feet high. His waist was so thick, it couldn’t be embraced. He looked all the more majestic and awe-inspiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a person such as him was worthy of using a sabre such as this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stood in front of him, appearing like a black panther standing in front of a majestic lion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the majestic lion was awe-inspiring and terrifying, the panther would definitely not cower from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang’s laughter didn’t stop. “Do you insist on me drawing first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang said, “You won’t regret it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust at this moment, a thunderbolt-like flash was charging downwards at him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang’s hand was still gripping the hilt of the sabre. The blade was still hidden within the pearl-encrusted sheath. He hadn’t drawn his sabre! The sabre light flew out from behind Fu Hongxue, as though lightning had suddenly struck out from clear skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had already focused all of his attention on the titan in front of him. How could he imagine that the sabre light would come from behind him? Although the woman outside had not ceased her song, she had secretly closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had already seen this thunderbolt-like sabre flash’s power. Where the sabre appeared, flesh and blood would fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had seen it too many times. She couldn’t bear to watch! She clearly didn’t really like to watch people being killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time, after the sabre flash chopped down, flesh and blood didn’t fly about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s body suddenly shot out at an incline, just perfectly managing to flit by the sabre flash. His sabre had already left the sheath as well, and with a backwards chop, he counter-attacked to the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had already calculated the position. This sabre attack of his should’ve landed right above the knees of the sabre-wielding man behind him. He never miscalculated. And his sabre had never missed its mark!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after his sabre shot out, he didn’t see blood. He only heard a swishing sound. It wasn’t the sound of bones being snapped. It was the sound of bamboo being chopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nine-foot long Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch flew out into the air. The tip of the sabre sliced into the ground, emanating a startling rainbow sabre light. From within the startling rainbow sabre light, it seemed as though there was a very small human shadow. With a sad and shrill laugh, it flew into the mulberry grove!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter disappeared with the shadow. But two shattered wooden sticks had suddenly appeared on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that these were the two legs of that person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan it be that he came while walking on stilts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue turned around. His sabre was already sheathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe godlike deity had already fallen down on top of the barbarian bed. All of his earlier majesty and aura had totally disappeared. Could it be that the undefeatable god of war was nothing more than a paper puppet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at him, Fu Hongxue said, “Who was that person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe titan said, “Miao Tianwang. He is the real Miao Tianwang.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “And you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe titan said, “I am only his puppet, a puppet for the attention of others to be drawn to. Just like this sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew the sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom within the magnificent, pearl-embroidered sheath, he drew out a wooden sabre with a layer of silver paint on top of it. This really was totally preposterous. Only a madman would do something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue couldn’t help but ask, “What type of person is he, exactly? Why did he do something like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant bowed his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman holding the golden cup was pouring alcohol into it nonstop. She poured for herself and drank it herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song of the woman underneath the window suddenly stopped. In a loud voice, she said, “They don’t dare tell you. I’ll tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer song was gentle and beautiful. However, her voice was now grief and hoarse with pain. “He isn’t a man at all, but he is desperate to believe in the illusion that he is a husband who can satisfy four women at once. He is only three feet, eight inches tall, but is desperate to believe in the illusion that he is a godlike giant. He does all of these things, simply because he is a madman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman holding the golden cup suddenly clapped her hands and laughed loudly. “Great! Great cursing! Such wonderful cursing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was laughing, but her face had already become contorted with pain. “Why don’t you straight-forwardly show this man surnamed Fu, how our mighty husband ‘satisfies’ us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman who was taking off his shoes suddenly tore her clothes apart. Her snow-white chest was filled with traces of lash marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is how he ‘satisfies’ us!” Her laughter was even more miserable than sobs. “I’ve always been an easily satisfied woman. I am simply so satisfied that I could die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue silently turned around. He silently walked away. He couldn’t bear to look, and couldn’t bear to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly thought of that girl who wore the jasmine flowers once more. They were all the same. They had been wreaked, had been devastated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the eyes of men, they were all women without face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they shameless because they were enduring the depredations of men?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how frenzied the depredations, they couldn’t help but endure it. Because they simply couldn’t resist, and had no place to run to. Is this what being ‘without face’ really meant? Is this ‘shamelessness’?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women were shouting, “Why don’t you rescue us? Why won’t you take us away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue didn’t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t that he didn’t want to rescue them. But he didn’t have the ability to whatsoever. There simply was nobody who could solve their problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo long as men who ‘really wanted face’ existed in the world, there would definitely be ‘shameless’ women such as them in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the real problem. This problem could never, ever be solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue didn’t look back, because he almost wasn’t able to resist from vomiting. He knew that the only way he could save them, wasn’t by taking them away. Only by killing Miao Tianwang could he truly free them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreshly broken twigs were on the ground. They had been shattered by a sabre. It was the sabre of the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chased down the path of these tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps Miao Tianwang had long since fled far away. He wasn’t really chasing Miao Tianwang, but an objective. He knew that so long as breath remained in his body, he would never give up this objective!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now he realized why Yan Nanfei absolutely had to kill Gongzi Yu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they were killing wasn’t actually the person, but the evil and tyranny which that person represented. He passed by the mulberry forest and entered the inner courtyard. A person was standing in the middle of the rubble of the courtyard, laughing stupidly at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even a millennia-old monastery has collapsed. Why haven’t you died? What are you waiting for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his moon-white monastic robes, ink dribbled here and there. But in his hands, he held a freshly blooming flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fresh, new, pure flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny yellow flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the foot of a mountain, there was a cabin which not only had bamboo growing outside of it, but also a few yellow flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was planted by a young girl. A girl with big eyes and long hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s heart sunk. His pupils suddenly contracted, and the hand with which he gripped the sabre clenched even tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did this flower come from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People come from their origins. Flowers naturally come from their origins as well!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crazy monk was still laughing stupidly. He suddenly tossed the flower in his hand to Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First look and see what type of flower this is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a flower of grief and farewell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no such flower in the world.” Fu Hongxue’s flower-holding hand was ice cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is. Since there is grief in the world and farewells in the world, why wouldn’t there be a flower of grief and farewell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crazy monk was no longer laughing. In his eyes, there was a look of indescribable pain. “Since there is such a thing as a flower of grief and farewell, the person who picked it would naturally be grieved and about to bid farewell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue held the flower with his two hands. His hands did not move, and there was no wind here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the petals of the flower suddenly began to fall, and the stem of the flower began to wither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two hands were originally used to draw his sabre. The force in these two hands was more than enough to destroy all life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crazy monk’s sadness became even greater. “The flower came from its origins, and has gone to its departure point. What about the person? Why hasn’t the person gone back yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Go back where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crazy monk said, “From whence one came, is where one should return. If you go back now, perhaps you’ll make it in time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “In time to do what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crazy monk said, “How should I know what you are going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Who, exactly, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crazy monk said, “I am only a crazy monk. I only happened to pick up a little flower, is all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly waved his hands and shouted loudly, “Go, hurry up and leave and do what you need to do! Don’t come here and bother this monk! Monks want tranquility!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monk had already sat down, in the midst of the rubble. In the blink of an eye, he became still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the main hall of the monastery had been wrecked, the main hall in his heart was still perfect and untarnished. That was like the shell of a snail. When the wind and the rain arrived, he could immediately hide inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he able to tell that the wind and the rain had arrived now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting sun shone across the sky. There was no rain or wind. Wind and rain are in the hearts of man. In the heart of Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid this flower come from near the bamboo patch? Why was it called the flower of grief and farewell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was grieved? Who was departing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue didn’t ask. He didn’t dare ask. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t get it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he wanted to know the answer, he had only one method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used all of his energy to rush back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you go back now, perhaps you’ll make it in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by the time he got back, it was already too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yellow flowers beneath the bamboo patch had totally disappeared. Not a single petal remained. The people had disappeared as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the table, there was still three vegetable dishes, a pot of porridge, and two sets of chopsticks. The porridge was still warm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children’s urine on the bed hadn’t dried yet either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhuo Yuzhen! Du Shiqi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue howled loudly, but there was no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Zhuo Yuzhen desert him? Or did Du Shiqi betray them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue raised his head to the heavens. He asked the sky, but the sky did not respond. He asked the stars, but they were silent. He asked the bright moon, but the bright moon had long since sunk down. Where would he have to go in order to find them? Where could he go, to hide from this wind and rain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was gloomy and dark. From within the darkness, there were suddenly three popping sounds, and then a lightning bolt appeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t a lightning bolt. It was sabre light. From within the sabre light, the shadow of a person taller than a tree could be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow flew out at the same time as the sabre light. It was a deformed dwarf. He walked on a three foot long bamboo pole, and in his hands, he wielded a nine foot long sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of sabre light. It chopped apart the bamboo patch, then rushed towards Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue retreated eight feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre light chopped again. The eaves of the house split apart. The power of the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch was like that of a thunderbolt or a thunderclap. The vertical sabre once more chopped at Fu Hongxue. In the blink of an eye, over seven chops had been launched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue continued to retreat. He could only retreat, because he could neither block nor counterattack. He had to leap three feet into the air before his sabre could hit Miao Tianwang, who was standing on those bamboo poles. But his entire body had been surrounded by the power of the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang was gripping the sabre with both hands. One chop followed after another, not even giving him the chance to pant!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even true thunderbolts and thunderclaps had an interval time. Even a real god of war would eventually exhaust his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue dodged over forty nine sabre chops in a row. His body suddenly shot out from within the sabre light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sabre had shot out as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch was too long. A foot longer, a foot stronger, as the saying goes…but the blade could only strike from afar. When the enemy rushed into close combat, there was no one way to save oneself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw this fatal flaw of Miao Tianwang’s. His sabre had already pierced towards Miao Tianwang’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would have imagined that just at this moment, Miao Tianwang’s stilts suddenly shattered into many pieces!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly fell down from the sky, and released the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch as well. With a backhand, he drew out a different sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short sabre, radiating cold light in all directions. Carrying his body’s downward force, it pierced towards Fu Hongxue’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s sure-fire attack had instead become his own fatal weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a brave panther charged towards a person, an experienced hunter would often dodge from beneath them and use a knife to split them open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Fu Hongxue’s mid-air body was like that of a leaping panther. The hunter’s knife had already reached his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could even sense that the ice-cold sabre had split apart his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiao Tianwang had already calculated that he definitely could not dodge this slash. This wasn’t the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch, but it was still a sabre for killing people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had already concentrated all of his strength into that sabre, but his strength suddenly disappeared. All strength suddenly disappeared. It was as though all of the air in a balloon had suddenly escaped through a hole. His sabre clearly could have pierced Fu Hongxue’s chest, but he had no power left to stab with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened? He didn’t understand. Even in death, he didn’t understand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw blood, but it wasn’t Fu Hongxue’s blood. Where did the blood come from? He didn’t understand this either!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now did he suddenly feel an indescribably cold feeling in his throat, as though it had already been cut open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe definitely could not believe that when the sabre light had flashed earlier, it had already cut open his throat. Even in death, he wouldn’t believe that there could be such a fast sabre in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t even see that sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue fell down as well. He fell into the middle of the bamboo patch. Heaven and earth reverted to its earlier peacefulness and silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly felt very tired. Although the earlier events had passed in the blink of an eye, in that blink of an eye, he had exhausted all of his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distance between life and death is such a very fine line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now did he truly understand the meaning of this phrase. Just then, he really was too close to dying. This battle really was a vicious battle the likes of which he had never fought before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStars filled the sky. The blood had already dried. Miao Tianwang’s blood. Not his!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he too had a type of feeling, as though all of his blood had dried up as well. Right now, if Miao Tianwang could brandish his sabre, he definitely would not be able to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe even felt as though if a child with a rusty knife came here, he would still die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, dead men couldn’t wield sabres. And so late at night, nobody would come to this mountain village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, hoping to be able to take a nap. Only with a clear mind could one think about moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would have imagined that somebody would come, right at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, an patter of footsteps could suddenly be heard in the darkness. Within the slow, unhurried footsteps, there seemed to be a strange rhythym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a person who was totally confident in what he was doing had such a rhythm while walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was this person? Why did he come here? What did he come here for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue listened silently. In his heart, he suddenly felt a strange feeling as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rhythym of these footsteps seemed to be exactly the same as the rhythym of that bell within the ancient monastery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a funeral bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rhythym of these footsteps seemed to be filled with a murderous air as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-15\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-17\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-16","bookId":1505,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM"}
