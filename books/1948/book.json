I\u0027m married to Bobby Polgar now (you know, the famous chess champion who just happens to be the man I love!). And we\u0027ve got this beautiful house with a view of Puget Sound. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eLately something\u0027s been worrying Bobby, though. When I asked, he said he was \u0027protecting his queen\u0027 and I got the oddest feeling he wasn\u0027t talking about chess but about \"me.\" He wouldn\u0027t say anything else. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eDo you remember Get Nailed, the beauty salon in Cedar Cove? I still work there. I\u0027ll tell you about my friend Rachel, who\u0027s got two men interested in her (count \u0027em, \"two\"). And I\u0027ll let you in on what I\u0027ve heard about Linnette McAfee, who left town when her love life fell apart. (\"That\" kind of trouble I know all about.) Come in soon for a manicure and a chat, okay? \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eTeri ( Miller) Polgar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:36 AM"}
