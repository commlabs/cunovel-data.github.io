He didn’t like to admit it, but he had nightmares. He dreamed of long, chalky roads that ended abruptly, leaving him to drop; and sometimes, of a dank basement where he was contained, with a low, dark ceiling crawling with spiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, it was impossible to sleep past five a.m. once the garbage truck came rattling by on Meth Row. Impossible to nap, too, during the day, when the lunch crowd made a rush on Dot’s Diner, and waiters hauled garbage in and out, and emptied grease traps, and rattled the Dumpsters past Dodge’s window and into Meth Row for collection. Every so often, when the diner’s back door opened, the swell of conversation carried the sound of Dodge’s mom’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore coffee, honey?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the day after the challenge at the water towers, Dodge slept soundly, dreamlessly, all the way through the lunch rush, and didn’t wake up until after two o’clock. He pulled on a pair of track pants, debated whether he should shower, then decided against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heya,” Dayna said when he wandered into the kitchen. He was starving. Thirsty, too. It was like the game was opening up a hunger inside him. “How did it go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was parked in the living room, where she could watch TV and look out the window onto the back of the diner. Gray light came weakly through the window, and dust motes floated in the air behind her. For a second, Dodge felt a rush of affection for the little room: the cracked TV stand, the thin, patchy rug, the lumpy sofa that had, for reasons unknown, been upholstered in denim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, for her. His Dayna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, the resemblance between them had faded, especially in the last year, when she had put on a lot of weight in her face and chest and shoulders. Still, it was there, even though they didn’t share a father, and she was much lighter than he was: in the dark brown hair, and the hazel eyes spaced far apart; the definite chins; and in their noses, which both curved almost imperceptibly to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge opened the refrigerator. His mom must have gone out last night; there were cartons of leftover Chinese. He opened them and sniffed. Chicken with broccoli and shrimp fried rice. Good enough. Dayna watched him as he piled it all onto a plate and, without bothering to nuke it, grabbed a fork and started eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” she prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had wanted to save the news, to torture her by not telling, but he had to talk. He had to share it with someone. He put the plate down, came into the living room, and sat on the couch, which he and Dayna had nicknamed the Butt. “It was a bust,” he said. “Cops came.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him carefully. “Are you sure you want to do this, Dodge?” she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Dayna.” He was annoyed that she’d even asked. He hauled her legs into his lap. Massage was the only thing that would keep them from total atrophy, and he still insisted on working her calves every day, even though she’d been saying for a long time that it was useless. She’d seen a dozen different doctors. And she’d been going to physical therapy for well over a year now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’d been no change. No improvement. She’d never walk again. Not without a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the daily massages, Dayna’s legs were thin—stalky and pale, like something that would grow on a plant. Even as her face had become rounder, the flesh of her arms looser, her legs continued to wither. Dodge tried not to think about how often, as a kid, those same legs had pumped her forward during a footrace, and propelled her into trees when they had climbing wars. She had always been strong—as hard as polished wood, scrappy and made of muscle. Stronger than most boys, and braver, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Dodge’s whole life, she had been his best friend, his partner in crime. She was two years older than him, and had been the de facto leader of whatever scheme or game they had invented. When he was five, they’d bottled their farts and tried to sell them. When he was seven, they’d spent a summer exploring their neighborhood in Dawson, Minnesota, looking for treasure, and wound up with a garden shed full of weird shit: an old top hat, a busted radio, two tire spokes, and the rusted frame of a bicycle. They’d found adventure in whatever shitty-ass town their mom had happened to dump them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they would never have another adventure. She would never climb, or bike, or bet him five bucks she could still beat him in a footrace. She would always need help to bathe, to get on and off the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was all Luke Hanrahan’s fault. He’d messed with Dayna’s car, fucked with the steering in advance of the showdown, forcing her off the road. Dodge knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom went on a date last night,” Dayna said, obviously trying to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” Dodge said. He was still vaguely annoyed. Besides, everywhere they went, his mom found some new loser to date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDayna shrugged. “She seemed into it. And she wouldn’t tell me who.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was probably embarrassed,” Dodge said. In the silence, he heard banging from outside—someone was going through the Dumpsters. Dayna leaned forward to look out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Kelly?” he said, and Dayna nodded. Little Bill Kelly had to be thirty and at least six foot five, but his dad, Bill Kelly, had been police chief for twenty years before his retirement, and everyone knew him as Big Kelly. Dodge had only ever seen Big Kelly once, and even then only for a second, when he’d accidentally biked out in front of Bill’s car. Bill had leaned on the horn and shouted for Dodge to be careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge sighed, eased Dayna’s legs off his lap, and stood up. Through the window he could see Little Kelly balancing on a steel drum full of old grease, methodically sorting through one of the Dumpsters sandwiched up against the back of Dot’s Diner, just next to the kitchen door. It was the third time in a month he’d been picking garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge didn’t bother putting on a shirt. He crossed the short concrete alley that divided their apartment from the diner, careful to avoid the broken glass. The kitchen boys drank beers during their shift sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, man,” Dodge said, deliberately loud, deliberately cheerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Kelly straightened up like he’d been electrocuted. He climbed down unsteadily from the steel drum. “I’m not doing nothing,” he said, avoiding Dodge’s gaze. Other than the stubble on his chin, Little Kelly had the face of an overgrown baby. He had once been a star athlete, a good student, too, but had gotten screwed in the head over in Afghanistan. Or Iraq. One of those. Now he rode the buses all day and forgot to come home. Once Dodge had passed Little Kelly sitting cross-legged at the corner of the road, crying loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You looking for something?” Dodge noticed that Little Kelly had made a small trash pile at the foot of the Dumpster, of tinfoil wrappers, metal coils, bottle caps, and a broken plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Kelly looked at him for a minute, jaw working, like he was trying to chew through leather. Then, abruptly, he pushed past Dodge and disappeared around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge squatted and started to gather up all the crap Little Kelly had removed from the Dumpster. It was already hot, and the alley smelled. Just then he sensed motion behind him. Thinking Little Kelly had returned, he straightened and spun around, saying, “You really shouldn’t be back here—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words dried up in his throat. Natalie Velez was standing behind him, leaning her weight onto her good foot, looking clean and showered and pretty and like she belonged anywhere else but here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” she said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first, instinctive response was to walk past her, go into the house, slam the door, and suffocate himself. But of course, he couldn’t. Holy shit. Nat Velez was standing in front of him, and he was shirtless. And hadn’t brushed his teeth. Or showered. And he was holding tinfoil from the trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just cleaning up.…” He trailed off helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat’s eyes ticked down to his bare chest, then up to his hair, which was in all probability sticking straight up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God.” Her face began to turn pink. “I should have called. I’m so sorry. Did you just get up or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No, not at all. I was just . . .” Dodge tried not to talk too forcefully, or breathe too hard, in case his breath was rank. “Look, can you give me a minute? Just wait here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Nat was even cuter when she blushed. She looked like a cookie that had been iced for Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One minute,” Dodge repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, Dodge sucked in a deep breath. Holy shit. Nat Velez. He didn’t even have time to worry about the fact that she was seeing his house, his crappy little apartment, and had probably had to walk past the grease traps being emptied, had gone in her little sandals past the sodden bits of spinach that got trekked out of the diner by the cooks, past the Dumpsters and their smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom, he brushed his teeth and gargled with mouthwash. He smelled his underarms—not bad—and put on deodorant just in case. He ran water through his hair and pulled on a clean white T-shirt, one that showed just a bit of the tattoo that covered most of his chest and wrapped around his right shoulder and forearm. His hair was already sticking up again. He rammed on a baseball hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Decent, at least. He sprayed on a bit of this man’s body-spray thing his mom had gotten for free at Walmart, feeling like a douche, but thinking it was better to feel like a douche than to smell like an asshole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Nat was doing a good job of pretending not to notice that Dodge lived in a falling-down apartment behind a diner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” She smiled again, big and bright, and he felt his insides do a weird turnover. He hoped Dayna wasn’t watching out the window. “Sorry about, like, barging up on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was going to call,” she said. “I texted Heather for your number. Sorry. But then I thought it might be better to talk in person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s totally fine.” Dodge’s voice came out more harshly than he’d intended. Shit. He was screwing this up already. He coughed and crossed his arms, trying to look casual. Really it was because his hands suddenly felt like meat hooks at the end of his arms, and he had forgotten what to do with them. “How’s your ankle?” An Ace bandage was wrapped thickly around her ankle and foot, which made a funny contrast to her legs, which were bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sprained.” Nat made a face. “I’ll live, but . . .” For a brief second, her face spasmed, like she was in pain. “Look, Dodge, is there someplace we can go? Like, to talk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way he was taking her inside. Not an icicle’s chance in hell. He didn’t want Nat gaping at Dayna or, worse, trying too hard to be nice. “How did you get here?” he asked, thinking she might have a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, she blushed. “I had my dad drop me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t ask how she’d figured out where he lived. Like all things in Carp, it was usually just a question of asking around. The problem was where to take her. He couldn’t go into the diner. His mom was working. That left Meth Row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat walked slowly, still limping, although she seemed to be in less pain than she had been last night. But she took the first opportunity to sit down: on the rusted fender of an abandoned, wheel-less Buick. All its windows were shattered, and the seats were speckled with bird shit, the leather torn up by tiny animals. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/panic/page-7.html","bookId":1721,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:44 AM"}
