As far as anyone knew, she\u0027d taken the loaner her insurance company arranged to do a supply run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled up in front of the Hennessy house, on a shady street in Front Royal. The white van sat in the drive, beside a ramp that ran to the front door of the single-story ranch house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart knocked. She didn\u0027t question if it was nerves or anger. It didn\u0027t matter. She\u0027d do what she needed to do, say what she needed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened before Cilla reached it, and the woman she\u0027d seen the night before came out. Cilla saw her hand tremble on the knob she clutched at her back. \"What do you want here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to speak to your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla turned her head to stare deliberately at the van, then looked back into Mrs. Hennessy\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He took my car into the shop. It needed work. Do you think I\u0027m a liar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you. You don\u0027t know me. I don\u0027t know your husband any more than he knows me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you keep sending the police here, to our home. Again this morning,with their questions and suspicions, with your accusations.\" Mrs. Hennessy drew in a ragged breath. \"I want you to go away. Go away and leave us alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be happy to. I\u0027d be thrilled to. You tell me what it\u0027s going to take to make him stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop what? He\u0027s got nothing to do with your troubles. Don\u0027t we have enough of our own? Don\u0027t we have enough without you pointing your finger at us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not back down, Cilla told herself. She would not feel guilty for pushing at this small, frightened woman. \"He drives by my home almost every day. And almost every day he parks on the shoulder, sometimes for as long as an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hennessy gnawed her lips, twisted her fingers together. \"It\u0027s not against the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trespassing is against the law, cracking a man\u0027s skull open is against the law. Breaking in and destroying private property is against the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did none of those things.\" The fear remained, but a whip of anger lashed through it. \"And you\u0027re a liar if you say different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a liar, Mrs. Hennessy, and I\u0027m not a whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, unless you\u0027re as crazy as he is, that I\u0027m not responsible for what happened to your son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk about my boy. You don\u0027t know my boy. You don\u0027t know anything about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s absolutely right. I don\u0027t. Why would you blame me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t blame you.\" Weariness simply covered her. \"Why would I blame you for what happened all those terrible years ago? There\u0027s nobody to blame for that. I blame you for bringing the police down on my husband when we did nothing to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I went over to his van to introduce myself, to express my sympathy, he called me a bitch and a whore, and he spat at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flush of shame stained Mrs. Hennessy\u0027s cheeks. Her lips trembled as her eyes shifted away. \"That\u0027s what you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My half sister was right there. Is she a liar, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it is so, it\u0027s a far cry from everything you\u0027re laying at our door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw the way he looked at me last night, in the park. You know how much he hates me. I\u0027m appealing to you, Mrs. Hennessy. Keep him away from me and my home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla turned away. She\u0027d only gotten halfway down the ramp when she heard the door shut, and the lock shoot home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOddly, the conversation, however tense and difficult, made her feel better. She\u0027d done something besides calling the police and sitting back, waiting for the next assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing forward, as that was the direction she was determined to go, she swung by the real estate office to make an offer on the first house she\u0027d selected. She went in low, a fair chunk lower than she felt the house was worth in the current market. To Cilla, the negotiations, the offers, the counters, were all part of the fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the loaner, she contacted the agent in charge of the second listing to make an appointment for a viewing. No point, she decided, in letting the moss grow. She drove back to Morrow Village, completed another handful of errands, including a quick grocery run, before heading back toward home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spotted the white van before Hennessy spotted her. Since he came from the direction of the Little Farm, she assumed he\u0027d had time to go home, talk to his wife and drive out while she\u0027d been running around Front Royal and the Village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught sight of her as their vehicles passed, and the flare of recognition burned over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s right,\" she muttered as she rounded a curve, \"not my truck, since you beat the hell out of it last night.\" She shook off the annoyance, took the next turn. Her gaze flicked up to the rearview mirror to see the van coming up behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you want to have this out? she wondered. Have what Ford called a face-to-face? That\u0027s fine. Great. He could just follow her home where they\u0027d have a-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheel jerked in her hands when the van rammed her from behind. The sheer shock didn\u0027t allow room for anger, even for fear, as she tightened her grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rammed her again-a smash of metal, a squeal of tires. The truck seemed to leap under her and buck to the right. She wrenched the wheel, fighting it back. Before she could punch the gas, he rammed her a third time. Her tires skidded off the asphalt and onto the shoulder while her body jerked forward, slammed back. Her fender kissed the guardrail, and her temple slapped smartly against the side window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall bright dots danced in front of her eyes as she gritted her teeth, prayed and steered into the skid. The truck swerved, and for one hideous moment she feared it would flip. She landed with a bone-jarring thud, nose-down, in the runoff gully on the opposite shoulder as her air bag burst open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, she would think it was sheer adrenaline, sheer piss-in-your-face mad that had her leaping out of the truck, slamming the door. A woman ran across the lawn of a house set back across the road. \"I saw what he did! I saw it! I called the police!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Cilla nor Hennessy paid any attention. He shoved out of the van, fists balled at his sides as they came at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t come to my house! You don\u0027t talk to my wife!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you! Fuck you! You\u0027re crazy. You could\u0027ve killed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027d be in hell with the rest of them.\" Eyes wheeling, teeth bared, he knocked her back with a vicious shove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you put your hands on me again, old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved her again, sending her feet skidding until she slammed into the back of the truck. \"I see you in there. I see you in there, you bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he raised his fist. Cilla kicked him in the groin, and dropped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God. Oh my God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDazed, adrenaline seeping out like water through cracks in a dam, Cilla saw the Good Samaritan racing down the road toward her. The woman had a phone in one hand, a garden stake in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right? Honey, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I think. I... I feel a little sick. I need to-\" Cilla sat, dropped her head between her updrawn knees. She couldn\u0027t get her breath, couldn\u0027t feel her fingers. \"Can you call someone for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I can. Don\u0027t you think about getting up, mister. I\u0027ll hit you upside the head with this, I swear I will. Who do you want me to call, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla kept her head down, waiting for the dizziness to pass, and gave her new best friend Ford\u0027s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got there before the police, all but flew out of his car. She\u0027d yet to try to stand, and would forever be grateful that Lori Miller stood like a prison guard over Hennessy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHennessy sat, sweat drying on his bone-white face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you hurt? You\u0027re bleeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. I just hit my head. I think I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to call for an ambulance, but she said no. I\u0027m Lori.\" The woman gestured in the direction of her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Cilla-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just a little shaky. I thought I was going to be sick, but it passed. Help me up, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me first.\" He cupped her chin, studied her eyes. Apparently what he saw satisfied him enough for him to lift her to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knees are wobbly,\" she told him. \"This hurts.\" She laid her fingers under the knot on her temple. \"But I think that\u0027s the worst of it. I don\u0027t know how to thank you,\" she said to Lori.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t do anything, really. You sure know how to take care of yourself. Here they come.\" Lori pointed to the police car. \"Now my knees are wobbly,\" she said with a breathless laugh. \"I guess that\u0027s what happens after the worst is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE TOLD the story to one of the county deputies as, she imagined, Lori gave her witness statement to the other across the road. She imagined the skid marks told their own tale. Hennessy, as far as she could tell, refused to speak at all. She watched the deputy load him into the back of the cruiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got stuff in the truck. I need to get it out before they tow it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send someone back for it. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was nearly home,\" she said as Ford helped her into his car. \"Another half mile, I\u0027d have been home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to put some ice on that bump, and you need to tell me the truth if you hurt anywhere. You need to tell me, Cilla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell yet. I feel sort of numb, and exhausted.\" She let out a long sigh when he stopped in front of his house. \"I think if I could just sit down for a while, in the cool, until I, I guess the phrase is collect myself. You\u0027ll call over, ask a couple of the guys to get the stuff out of the truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his arm around her waist to lead her into the house. \"Bed or sofa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bed or sofa,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sofa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked her into the lounge so he could keep an eye on her while he got a bag of frozen peas for her temple. Spock tiptoed to her to rub his head up and down her arm. \"It\u0027s okay,\" she told him. \"I\u0027m okay.\" So he planted his front paws on the side of the couch, sniffed at her face, licked her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down,\" Ford ordered when he came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s fine. In fact... maybe I could have him up here for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord patted the couch. On cue, Spock jumped up, bellied in beside Cilla and laid his heavy, comforting head below her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord eased pillows behind her head. He brought her a cold drink, brushed his lips lightly over her forehead, then laid the cold bag at her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make the calls. You need anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ve got it all. Better already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"It\u0027s the magic peas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turned away, stepped out onto the back veranda to make the calls, the smile had turned to a look of smoldering fury. His fist pounded rhythmically against the post as he punched numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t go into it now,\" he said when Matt answered. \"Cilla\u0027s here. She\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean she\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t go into it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her truck\u0027s about a half mile down, headed toward town. I need you to send somebody down to get whatever she picked up today out of it. Hennessy was at her, and now the cops have him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy sh-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you back later when I can talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked off, glanced at his hand and saw he\u0027d pounded it often and hard enough to draw some blood. Oddly, it helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding he was calm enough, Ford stepped back inside. Because she lay quiet, eyes closed, one arm over the dog, he opened the window seat to take out one of the throws stored inside. Her eyes opened when he draped it over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not asleep. I was trying to remember how to meditate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meditate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"California, remember? Anyone living in California over a year must meet minimum meditation requirements. Unfortunately, I always sucked at it. Empty your mind? If I empty part of mine, something jumps right in to fill the void. And I know I\u0027m babbling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\" He sat on the edge of the couch, turned the bag of peas over to lay the colder side on her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ford, he really wanted to kill me.\" Her eyes clung to his, and he saw the shadow of pain in them as she pushed herself up to sit. \"It\u0027s not like doing grand jetes through the woods while the reanimated psycho killer chases you. I\u0027ve had people dislike me. My own mother from time to time. I\u0027ve even had people try to hurt me. I dated this guy once who slapped me around good one night. One night,\" she repeated. \"He never got the chance to do it again. But even he didn\u0027t hate me. He didn\u0027t want me dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how to resolve that someone does. I don\u0027t know how to fit that into my life and deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t resolve it. You don\u0027t resolve something that has no sanity or logic. And, Cilla, you are dealing with it. You did. You stopped him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A really lucky kick into seventy-, maybe eighty-year-old balls. I was so pissed, Ford, that I didn\u0027t think. Do I stay in the truck, lock the doors, call nine-one-one, or you, or the half a dozen guys a half mile away like a rational person? No, I jump out and confront this... this lunatic who\u0027s just tried to run me off the road, like he\u0027s going to fear the sharp lash of my tongue. And I\u0027m still so pissed when he starts shoving me, I don\u0027t take off. Like I couldn\u0027t outrun a man old enough to be my grandfather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a runner.\" He laid his finger over her lips when she started to speak. \"You\u0027re not. Do I wish it had occurred to you to lock yourself in the truck and call me? Maybe. Because then I could\u0027ve come speeding to the rescue. I could\u0027ve kicked him in the balls. But the fact is, I feel some better knowing that when somebody tries to hurt you, you know how to take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could go a long time without having to take care of myself like that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\" He stroked her hair when she laid her head on his shoulder. \"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe he could\u0027ve gone a little while longer without realizing he was in love with her. He could\u0027ve strolled into that, the way he strolled across the road to her house. Casual and easy. Instead, he\u0027d had it slammed into him, clutched in the meaty fist of fear and rage, in one hard and painful punch when he\u0027d seen her sitting on the side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing to do about it now, he told himself. Bad, bad timing. What she needed now was a shoulder to lean on, somebody to get her a bag of frozen peas and offer a quiet place to... collect herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strangely, it feels like I bashed it against a window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you take some aspirin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. And maybe a session in your hot tub. I\u0027m a little stiff and sore. I got jostled around pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to fight to keep his grip on her from tightening, to stop himself from squeezing her against him. \"I\u0027ll set you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" She turned her head to brush her lips against his throat. \"Thanks especially for helping me stay calm. You too,\" she said, and kissed Spock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All part of our post-trauma service here at the House of Sawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped her downstairs. He flipped back the lid of the hot tub, hit the jets, while she took off her shirt. \"Want the iPod?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. Maybe I\u0027ll give meditation another shot.\" She winced as she reached back for the hook of her bra. \"Definitely stiff and sore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me. I have experience with these devices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, let her arms drop as he moved behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh fury gushed into him, one hot blast of blind, mindless rage. Bruises purpled across her back, along her shoulder blades, in angry storm clouds. More bruising mottled the skin high on her left biceps, and a raw, red line like a burn rode over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having trouble with the mechanics?\" Cilla asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Amazing, he thought, how calm his voice sounded. How matter-of-fact. \"You\u0027ve got some bruises back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s what I feel. It must be from when he shoved me against the truck.\" She tipped her head to the side, down, then sucked in some air as she brushed her fingers over her shoulder and across her chest. \"Seat belt burn, too. Shit. Well, better than the alternative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck that.\" He said it softly, but still she shifted to look around at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck. That.\" He bit off the words now as that gush of fury spewed out, a raging, boiling geyser. \"You\u0027ll have to get your calm and your Zen somewhere else, because I\u0027m not up for it. Goddamn it. Goddamn it! The son of a bitch came at you. You\u0027re all bruised and bashed up. He did that to you. Did you see your truck? For Christ\u0027s sake, did you see what he did, what he tried to do? He hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d turned to face him, to stare at him. With hands stunningly gentle in contrast to his face, his voice, he unhooked her work pants, crouched to ease them down her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your truck\u0027s in a fucking ditch, and the only reason you\u0027re not is because you took him out. There were skid marks on the road as far as I could see.\" He took off her shoes, her socks, lifted her foot, then the other to free them of the pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than the alternative? Better comes when I kick that crazy, murderous bastard\u0027s teeth down his throat. That\u0027s when better comes.\" He turned her around, unhooked her bra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked her up, eased her into the bubbling water where she just sat, staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get the aspirin and that robe you brought over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he strode away and up the stairs, Cilla let out a long breath. \"Wow,\" was really all she could think of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation might not have worked very well for her, but Cilla found fifteen minutes in hot water with pulsing jets helped considerably. Especially with the image of Ford\u0027s anger playing behind her closed lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadier than she\u0027d have believed possible, she carefully climbed out. As she wrapped herself in a towel, she heard him coming back down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do that,\" he said when she started to flip the lid back over the tub. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed her pills, water, and when she\u0027d taken them, helped her into the white terry robe she\u0027d left at his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about before. You don\u0027t need the ravings of another maniac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong. You helped me, you gave me exactly what I needed by staying calm when I was the shakiest. You stayed steady, and took me to the cool and the quiet. You gave me magic peas, and you let me lean on you. There have been a very limited number of people in my life that let me lean on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid her hands on his chest, on either side of his heart. \"And after I got through the worst of it, you gave me something else. The outrage, the anger, the blind thirst for revenge. It helps to know someone could feel that on my behalf. That while he was feeling all that, he could still take care. It\u0027s no wonder I fell for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so in love with you, Cilla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She felt a jolt, nearly as violent as she had while under attack. \"Oh, Ford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s lousy timing, but that doesn\u0027t change a thing. It\u0027s not what I was looking for. It\u0027s not simple and easy, just picking which bed we use and who walks home in the morning. That\u0027s how I figured it, and I was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ford-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not finished yet. When that woman-Lori-called, she was careful to let me know right off you were okay. But all she had to do was say accident, and my heart stopped. I never really understood what it was to be afraid until that moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything he\u0027d felt, and was feeling now, swirled in his eyes. So much, Cilla thought. So much in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I got there, and I saw you sitting on the side of the road. So pale. The relief came first, waves of it. Waves. There she is. I didn\u0027t lose her. Waves of relief, Cilla, and this lightning strike at the same time. There she is. And I knew. I\u0027m in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a day for shocks and jolts, and huge moments, Cilla thought. \"You\u0027re so steady, Ford, and I\u0027m so disordered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just another way of saying, \u0027It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s me.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t make it less true. I\u0027m caught right now between the thrill, and the terror, of having someone like you tell me he loves me. And mean it. And that\u0027s complicated because I have such strong, real feelings for you. I think I\u0027m in love with you, too. Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw up a hand as he stepped toward her. \"Just, wait. I probably have a mild concussion. I\u0027m at a disadvantage. You\u0027re steady,\" she repeated. \"And I bet you know exactly what you want out of being in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m disordered, and I don\u0027t. What I do know, or at least what I\u0027m pretty sure of, is you\u0027ll want, expect things to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But they don\u0027t have to change today, or tomorrow. Part of being steady might be as basic as knowing how to appreciate what you\u0027ve got, in the moment.\" He framed her face. \"There she is,\" he murmured, and brushed his lips to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla closed her eyes. \"Oh, God. I\u0027m in such trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be fine. Now let\u0027s go up. You should get off your feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay her on the living room sofa this time, and as he\u0027d expected, within twenty minutes the emotional and physical upheaval dropped her into sleep. He took his phone out onto the veranda, leaving the door open so he\u0027d hear her if she stirred. Sitting where he could watch her through the window, he started his calls with her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he spotted Matt heading up Cilla\u0027s drive toward his house, Ford figured his friend had been keeping an eye out for any sign. He finished up the call-this one to a friend, an RN, just to make sure he handled Cilla\u0027s injuries correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured Matt to a chair as he disconnected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell, Ford?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hennessy,\" he began, and ran through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus. Crazy bastard. Are you sure she\u0027s okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just talked to Holly. Remember Holly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nurse Holly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. She thinks it\u0027d be better if I could talk Cilla into getting checked out. But in the meantime, heat, cold, rest, ibuprofen. Got that covered so far. You saw the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, did a number on it. His own van, too. She got him with a nut shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, goddamn good for her,\" Matt said with both heat and admiration. \"I\u0027d like a shot at him myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, listen, you need anything, she needs anything, you know where I am. There are a lot of people across the road there who\u0027d say the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tell her not to worry about the work. We\u0027ve got it covered. You\u0027ll want to come over and set her alarm if she\u0027s staying here tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any questions, messages, whatever, I\u0027ll make sure I leave them in her famous notebook, and I\u0027ll pass the word to Brian. I\u0027ll check with you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the two-hour mark, Ford debated rousing her just in case she actually did have a concussion. Before he could decide, he saw the unmarked car pull into her drive. So he waited, watched Wilson and Urick get out, go in. Come out, get back into the car and pull across into his driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Sawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting to be a habit, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss McGowan\u0027s here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Banged up, worn out and sleeping. Where\u0027s Hennessy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in a cell. Do you want a list of the charges against him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, as long as there\u0027s enough to keep him in a cell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like to speak to Ms. McGowan, go over her statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s sleeping,\" Ford repeated, and rose. \"And she\u0027s had more than enough for one day. More than enough period. If Hennessy had been in a cell where he belonged, he wouldn\u0027t have had a chance to try to kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027d had any evidence, we\u0027d have put him in a cell before this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" Ford shot back. \"Better late than never?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ford.\" Cilla pushed open the screen. \"It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re right. It\u0027s not. But I\u0027ll talk to the detectives. Let\u0027s get it done.\" She opened the door wider. \"Would you wait in the living room a minute?\" she asked Wilson and Urick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they passed, she let the screen door close behind her, and laid her hands on Ford\u0027s shoulders. \"No one\u0027s ever shielded me.\" She kissed him. \"In my whole life, no one ever stood between me and something unpleasant. It\u0027s an amazing feeling. It\u0027s amazing to know I don\u0027t even have to ask if you\u0027ll stay with me while I do this. You can leave your silver armor in the shop. You don\u0027t need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took his hand, and walked inside with him to get it done. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-20.html","bookId":2414,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM"}
