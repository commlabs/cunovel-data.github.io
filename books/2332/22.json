As opposed to your friend Mick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let that go. \"Then Elaine woke me around noon,\" I said, \"after she heard about the incident at Grogan\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bombing, although I gather it was more than that. There was gunfire as well, wasn\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his empty coffee cup and tapped it against the edge of the saucer. \"The way I hear it,\" he said, \"you were there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got through telling you I was there. Then I went home, and it must have been two hours later that the shit hit the fan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hours later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the way I heard it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard I was there when it happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Matt,\" he said, looking straight at me. \"That\u0027s exactly what I heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s saying that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Information received. You want to rethink your story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My story? I haven\u0027t got a story. I told you what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you were nowhere to be seen when the crap was flying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"I blame it on all those years on the job,\" he said. \"If there\u0027s one thing a cop learns it\u0027s how to tell a lie and stick with it. And it\u0027s like riding a bicycle, right? You never forget how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I lied to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What gives you that idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think you lied to me. \u0027Information received.\u0027 You never heard I was at Grogan\u0027s. You were on a fishing trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spread his hands. \"We had a description, couple of guys seen leaving the scene. One was Ballou and the other could have been you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they say, it was a white male with two arms and two legs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, point taken. The description we had could fit half the precinct. If they\u0027d thrown in pain in the ass, then I\u0027d have no doubts. Maybe I was fishing, but that doesn\u0027t make me wrong. Goddamn it, I still think you were there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s a free country. You can think whatever you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve got your permission. While you\u0027re at it, you want to give me your word you weren\u0027t there when it all went down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for? You just got through telling me my word\u0027s not worth shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it\u0027s still worth something,\" he said, \"Or you wouldn\u0027t be reluctant to give it. I\u0027m not sure what kind of a game you\u0027re playing, my friend, but I don\u0027t think I like it. What are you trying to do, do you even fucking know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I understand the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe all you\u0027re trying to do is stay alive, and in that case I can\u0027t say I blame you. Here\u0027s a question you can answer straight. Have you been over there this afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where, Grogan\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. You happen to walk by, have a look-see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I came straight over here. From what I saw on the TV, there\u0027s nothing to see but plywood at this point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a shame you didn\u0027t get to see it the way I did. I was there this morning right after my shift started. They\u0027d removed the bodies by then, but I had pictures to look at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t envy you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I don\u0027t envy the poor bastards who were first on the scene, far as that goes. What a fucking nightmare.\" He cocked his head. \"If it was you looking at the pictures, there might have been one you recognized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the name Lisa Holtzmann mean anything to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" I said without hesitation. \"From a few years ago. She was a client, her husband got shot making a phone call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Killed by mistake, as it turned out. Like your friend last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Lisa? She was at Grogan\u0027s last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hear her name on the news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was there,\" he said. \"And come to think of it, maybe you wouldn\u0027t have recognized her from the picture. What I saw was strictly closed casket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen her around the neighborhood a few times over the years. Never at Grogan\u0027s, as far as I can recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wasn\u0027t there when you dropped by earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible, I suppose. If she was I didn\u0027t see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she was, she should have gone home when you did. You could have walked her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you getting at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know. Matt, if you\u0027re holding out information that could help clear the case, you\u0027re not doing anybody any good. Straight answers for a minute, okay? Do you know who shot your friend Faber?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I heard it was a black man, but I can\u0027t even say that out of my own knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guy was a pro, way it sounds to me. You don\u0027t know who might have hired him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or who was behind the mess at Grogan\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027m willing to believe it was the same person who hired the other shooter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t know who that might be, and neither does Ballou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not unless he\u0027s holding out on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t think he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see why he would. Did they say on the news the shooter at Grogan\u0027s was Asian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of them was. We\u0027ve got zip on the second man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know there was a second man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bomb chucker. Unless there was just the one guy, did the shooting and threw the bomb, but that seems a little unlikely. The eyewitness testimony suggests a second man, but it\u0027s not conclusive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the shooter was Asian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vietnamese, as a matter of fact Wasn\u0027t that on the news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was I missed it All I heard was Asian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they didn\u0027t release it yet. Don\u0027t ask me his name, but it\u0027s on file, along with his fingerprints and his pictures, full face and profile. Been on file a few years now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a sheet on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a troubled youth,\" he said. \"Remember Born To Kill? Slope gang based downtown, got a lot of press a few years ago for being more homicidal than the Viet Cong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weren\u0027t they the ones who shot up a wedding party in Jersey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it a wedding or a funeral? Whatever it was, it had all the old Mafia guys shaking their heads, wondering what the world was coming to. BTK was mostly running protection gangs in Chinatown, giving the tongs some grief, the usual first-generation crap. Reason you don\u0027t hear about them anymore is they mostly wound up dead or in jail. Or both, like our friend from last night. He did three years upstate for robbery and assault, and then last night he was dead at the scene.\" He leaned forward. \"Somebody shot his lights out. Maybe you, with what you got right there inside your jacket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a.38,\" I said. \"Is that what you dug out of Mr. Dead at the Scene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We left that little chore to the medical examiner. But no, he got punched out with three shots from a.45. When did you start carrying a gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I saw the news this morning. I\u0027ve got a carry permit, if that\u0027s been worrying you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s a load off my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who, the dead shooter? They\u0027ve all got the same name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be handy,\" I said. \"You call out one name and they all come running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean. They all got names like you\u0027d order in a restaurant if you could just figure out how to pronounce it. This one, his name started with NG, so even if I remembered it I wouldn\u0027t know how to say it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you get sick of being a cop, you can always go to work for the UN.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or the State Department, teaching \u0027em how to be diplomatic. What the hell do you care about the name of some dead slope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just an idle question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only it didn\u0027t sound that idle. What are you holding out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I supposed to believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" he said, \"you\u0027re licensed by the state of New York. You can\u0027t withhold evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any evidence to withhold. Any suspicions or theories I might have aren\u0027t evidence, and I\u0027m under no obligation to pass them on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were there last night, what you saw is evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in the bathroom,\" I said deliberately, \"and what I saw was my own face in the mirror, and I already told Wister- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about Grogan\u0027s. You son of a bitch, you knew I was talking about Grogan\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you I left before there was anything to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were home in your own kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drinking coffee. That what you do when you can\u0027t sleep? Drink coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only I\u0027d checked in with you, you could have told me to make it warm milk instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making a joke, but it\u0027s the best thing in the world before you go to bed. Even better, sweeten it with a stiff shot of scotch. But I guess you\u0027d leave the scotch out, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe not. Maybe you chip around. Is that why you like hanging out with your gangster friend? Do you sneak drinks from time to time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So far I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, give yourself time. What did your other friend think of you hanging out in ginmills with cheap crooks? Your friend Jim. I bet he thought it was a great idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a point to all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point is I think you were there last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what. You were at Grogan\u0027s when the shit hit the fan, and you must have been standing right in front of it, which is why you\u0027re so full of it right now. You know what he wants to do? George Wister? He wants to put out an order and have you picked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose he can do that if he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice of you to give him permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not going to learn anything he doesn\u0027t already know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, Matt, Matt,\" he said. \"I thought we were friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except they say a cop can only be friends with another cop, and that\u0027s not what you are anymore, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the same thing I\u0027ve been for as long as we\u0027ve known each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems to me you\u0027ve changed. But maybe not.\" He sat back in his seat. \"Let\u0027s wrap this up, okay? I don\u0027t know how deep you\u0027re into all of this, but the main reason I\u0027m here now is to warn you off. Stay the hell away from Ballou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s finished, Matt. Somebody came real close to doing the world a favor last night. He dodged the bullet, but he may not be that lucky next time. And you know there\u0027s gonna be a next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless first-rate police work leads to the quick arrest of those responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how can we miss, with the cooperation we\u0027re getting from the public? Not the point. Which is that he\u0027s going down. He\u0027s the focus of a major departmental investigation.
