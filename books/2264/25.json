His face was usually pleasant, patronizing, but pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, \"It\u0027s a long story. I\u0027ll let Fitz tell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop shook his head, \"Uh, no. We are not walking into a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"You aren’t, trust me. He\u0027s not something I can explain. You just have to see it, to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop scowled at me in the rearview. I rolled my eyes and watched out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop\u0027s stare never left the rearview for longer than a few seconds. He was obsessed with whatever was behind us. He swerved off the highway onto an off ramp. I caught a blur of the word Lovelock. He drove like a savage, skidding around corners and through a neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled into the driveway of a random house and parked the car. We jumped out—well, they jumped out and I hobbled after them. We crept along to the house next door and then through the backyard of that house. We ran through the backs of four houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop moved quickly. My heart was in my throat. Had he seen something? They moved like they had been born working together. I felt like the only non-agent, limping along behind them. They ran to a huge fence, each did a pull up and hopped over. I stood there looking at the six-foot fence. There was no way I was going up and over. I grabbed the rough wood and instantly pulled my finger back. The sound of footsteps coming distracted me from the splinter, I was about to pick out. I ran to the back corner of the yard and dropped to my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed handfuls of the weeds and dragged them out fast. My fingers cut and bled, but I ripped with savagery. I mussed my hair with my dirt-covered hands and then rubbed them across my face and clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Coop hissed through the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw dirt at the fence and hisses like a cat, \"Psssst! Get outta here, pesky cat.\" I wiped my hair back from my face and smeared more dirt and blood across my face, \"Darla, keep that cat in your own yard.\" I added a little Wisconsin flare to Darla, cat, and yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and screamed when I saw the seven men in black clothes. I held my head at a funny angle and made a face, \"You get outta my yard. We don’t have any gang activity around here. I\u0027m gonna call 9-1-1 if you don’t go. I\u0027m tired of you hooligans, thinking you can run this neighborhood.\" I stared at them with my mouth agape and the dirt covering my hands and face. I stuck my belly out as far as it would go and slouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the young men gave me a horrified look and put his hands in the air, \"Sorry ma\u0027am. You didn’t happen to see some people run through here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrunched my face up and used my grandma’s word for what, \"Wha? Wha? No.\" My Wisconsin flare was getting stronger, \"You get outta my yard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around and turned away, following the others around the house. My heart was pounding, but I turned back and started picking weeds again with shaking hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes, I got up and walked around the side of the house to the garage. I opened the unlocked door and walked in closing it slowly and locking it. I leaned against the back of it and took in gulps of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were military. The military was after us, we went off the reservation and they were looking for us. I didn’t know what to think. What had I done? Why hadn’t I just stayed with Servario, like they had wanted? I had risked my kids and mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped and looked up to see Coop in the far corner. I frowned, \"How did you…?\" I looked around the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked angry, \"That was stupid. Why didn’t you jump?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huffed as I spoke, \"Because my old, fat, lazy ass can\u0027t do a pull up, dick. My ankle is still sore and I don’t jump fences. I have twenty-two percent body fat and almost no upper body strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed, \"That is a respectable number for a woman my age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Keep telling yourself that. The car is around the block. Meet us there in five.\" He walked across the garage towards me. I stepped out of the way for him to leave through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the empty garage, \"How the bloody hell, am I supposed to do that?\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old Honda Civic in the garage gave me an idea. I climbed in the driver’s seat and pulled the wire box. I hot-wired the car and opened the garage door. I flipped the visor and looked at the dirt stains on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed out and closed the garage again. I pointed at the men in black in the driveway next door and shouted, \"Stay outta my yard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove away, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want the cocky feeling I was filled with to get me bad juju. Bad-agent juju always ended up with the cocky person getting caught. In my case, that would get me shipped back to Servario. The dirty part of my brain didn’t entirely object to going back. Servario had ways of convincing you that you wanted to stay. I had a horrid inkling that I’d only run out of fear of my feelings for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rounded the corner and stopped the car behind the minivan they had stolen. I could see Jack\u0027s dark head in the tinted window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out and hopped into the back of the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce was laughing, \"That was amazeballs, dude. Put it there.\" She held her knuckles out. Apparently amazeballs was a positive thing. Even Jack was snickering. I patted the top of her knuckles with my hand, earning me a crazy look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at them, \"I hate you all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop growled and drove the van like he was late for his kids’ hockey practice. I mocked him behind his back with sneers. Luce smiled and nodded in his direction, \"I thought he was going to have a stroke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, \"Yeah, well I woulda had a stroke, if I tried to jump that fence. My ankle is still sore and I\u0027m out of shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nudged me, \"You look great to me. My mom is really out of shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open, \"I\u0027m not old enough to be your mom, you little shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed, contrasting his cheeks against his dark hair, \"Sorry. You know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him, \"How old is your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed and looked at Luce for help, \"Uhm… she\u0027s forty-three. She was twenty-one when she had me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my lips together. My best mom friend was forty-five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snarled, \"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce looked back, \"My mom\u0027s fifty if that makes you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “Screw you all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, \"Did you hot-wire that car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at that, \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop looked at me in the rearview, \"Lucky it was an older model. They\u0027re easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my gaze, \"You\u0027re dead.\" He smiled his cocky, asshole grin, the one that made my blood boil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked out the window as he drove, and Luce played a game on her iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t they trace that one?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, \"I buy my personal shit from a guy who makes sure it falls off a truck and lands in a tech guy’s hands, and then gets sold under a table somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted, \"Nice and legal you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up and winked, \"It\u0027s the only way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are they coming after us for going off the reservation?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked back, \"We had no idea what we were getting into, with you and your husband. We honestly thought this was a weapon to destroy the world, as it always is, and someone betrayed the government like they always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed, \"Don’t lump me with my husband. He isn’t my husband. He\u0027s in on this on his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s eyes glinted when he grinned back at me, \"Regardless, we don’t think that’s the case anymore. We think your dad was in on some crazy shit and somehow you are being used to find whatever he hid, a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"What I want to know is why are they turning on us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and turned back around, \"No clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lips and prayed Uncle Fitz would know what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived in Salt Lake six hours later. I was passed out when I felt the car stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up as Coop parked and instantly felt my neck go out. I winced, rubbing the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce too woke up and stretched. She yawned and smirked at me, \"Crick in the neck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I am too old for this shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and got out of the car. I tried to stretch, but the pain in my neck was shooting down my spine. Coop walked over with his iPhone and held it out, \"This is the map of the city. Where am I going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack got out and walked into the corner store we were parked at, with Luce following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grab me some chocolate and flavored water please!\" I shouted at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a thumbs up and walked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the map, still rubbing my neck. Coop grabbed my arm and spun me around. He handed me the phone and started massaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me. You look at the map,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let the warmth and strength of his fingers relax me. I moaned, “That feels amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhhhhhh. Just rub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"Oh the things I could add to that comment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, but kept my eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your dad was a good man, right? The reports are true, right?\" he asked after a couple minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"He was the best. He sacrificed everything for this country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath tickled the back of my neck, when he let out a long sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes and dragged the map so it zoomed in on a spot, \"Corner of Edison and ninth, next to Randy\u0027s Record Shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe increased the pressure, digging into my neck. I closed my eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so tense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoffed, \"Uh… yeah. Of course I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"You gotta learn to roll with the punches a little better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled away and gave him a horrified look, \"Excuse me? You bury your husband and the next day get molested on a plane by an arms dealer, and kill a fat guy who wants you to spank him and jerk him off, then tell me how YOU feel.\" I shook my head and climbed back into the van. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-25.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
