But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eJake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIf Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry. Jake\u0027s got personal revenge on his mind, and he\u0027s spending too much time talking that dead vampire. He\u0027s got to start thinking about the future--or he won\u0027t have one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:57 PM"}
