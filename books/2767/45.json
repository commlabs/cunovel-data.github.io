I\u0027m goin\u0027 to college here. Mrs. P. and Dr. Aguirre helped me get a GED after I quit the Blood. I sold Julio. I\u0027m workin\u0027 at the student union and takin\u0027 out loans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex? In college? His shirtsleeves, neatly buttoned at his wrists, hide most of his Latino Blood tattoos. \"You quit? I thought you said it was too dangerous to quit, Alex. You said people who try to get out die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I almost did. If it weren\u0027t for Gary Frankel, I probably wouldn\u0027t have made it. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gary Frankel?\" The nicest, geekiest guy in school? For the first time I scan Alex\u0027s face and see a faint, new scar above his eye and nasty ones by his ear and neck. \"Oh, God! W-what did they d-do to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hand and places it on his chest. His eyes are intense and dark, like they were the first time I noticed him in the parking lot that first day of school senior year. \"It took me a long time to realize I needed to fix everything The choices I made. The gang. Bein\u0027 beaten to within an inch of my life and branded like cattle was nothin\u0027 compared to losin\u0027 you. If I could take back every word I said in the hospital, I would. I thought if I pushed you away, I\u0027d be protectin\u0027 you from what happened to Paco and my dad.\" He looks up and his eyes pierce mine. \"I\u0027ll never push you away again, Brittany. Ever. I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeaten? Branded? I\u0027m feeling sick to my stomach and tears sting my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh.\" He puts his arms around me, rubbing his hands across my back. \"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027m okay,\" he chants over and over again, his voice catching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe feels good. This feels good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rests his forehead against mine. \"You need to know somethin\u0027. I agreed to the bet because deep down I knew that if I got emotionally involved, it\u0027d kill me. And it nearly did. You were the one girl who made me risk everythin\u0027 for a future worth havin\u0027.\" He straightens and takes one step back to look me in the eye. \"I\u0027m so sorry. Mujer, tell me what you want and I\u0027ll give it to you. If it\u0027ll make you happy for me to leave you alone for the rest of your life, say the word. But if you still want me, I\u0027ll do my best to be this. . . .\" He gestures to his clothes. \"How can I prove to you I\u0027ve changed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve changed, too,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027m not the girl I was before. And I\u0027m sorry, but those clothes . . . they\u0027re not you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong, Alex. I want you. Not a fake image. I definitely prefer you in jeans and a T-shirt, because that\u0027s who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at his attire and chuckles. \"You\u0027re right.\" He looks back up at me. \"You once said you loved me. Do you still?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister is watching this exchange between us. She smiles warmly at me, giving me the strength to tell him the truth. \"I never stopped loving you. Even when I tried desperately to forget you, I couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets out a long, slow breath and rubs his forehead in relief. His eyes look glassy, filled with emotion. I feel my own eyes welling up again and I gather a handful of his shirt in my fist. \"I don\u0027t want to fight all the time, Alex. Dating should be fun. Love should be good.\" I\u0027m pulling him toward me. I want his lips on mine. \"W-will it ever be good for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lips almost touch before he pulls away from me, but then he--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. My. God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kneels on one knee before me, holds my hands in his, and my heart skips more than a few beats. \"Brittany Ellis, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to prove to you I\u0027m the guy you believed in ten months ago, and I\u0027m gonna be the successful man you dreamed I could be. My plan is to ask you to marry me four years from now, the day we graduate.\" He cocks his head as his voice takes on a more playful tone. \u0027And I guarantee you a lifetime of fun, probably one with no lack of fightin\u0027, for you are one passionate mamacita . . . but I definitely look forward to some great make-up sessions. Maybe one day we can even go back to Fairfield and help make it the place my dad always hoped it would be. You, me, and Shelley. And any other Fuentes or Ellis family member who wants to be a part of our lives. We\u0027ll be one big, crazy Mexican-American family. What do you think? Mujer, you own my soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but smile as I swipe a lone tear trailing down my cheek. How can I not be crazy in love with this guy? Time away from him didn\u0027t change anything. I can\u0027t deny him another chance. That would be denying myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to take the risk, to trust once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shelley, you think she\u0027ll take me back?\" Alex asks her, his hair dangerously close to her fingers. She doesn\u0027t pull his hair . . . just pats his head gently. I feel the tears running down my cheeks at full speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\" Shelley yells with a goofy, gummy grin. She looks happier and more content than she\u0027s been in a long time. Both of my favorite people are with me right here; what more could I ask for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your major?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex flashes me his you-can\u0027t-resist-me smile. \"Chemistry. And yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chemistry.\" I wrap my arms around his neck. \"Kiss me so we can see if we still have it. \u0027Cause you own my heart, my soul, and everything else in between.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips finally sear mine, more powerful than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. The solar system is finally in alignment, and I got my Do Over without even asking for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEPILOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-Three Years Later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Peterson closes the door to her classroom. \"Good afternoon and welcome to senior chemistry.\" She walks to her desk, leans on the edge, and opens her class folder. \"I appreciate you picking your own seats, but since this is my class, I make the seating arrangements . . . alphabetically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroans erupt from the students, the same sound that has greeted her on the first day of school for over thirty years at Fairfield High.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Alcott, take the first seat. Your partner is Andrew Carson.\" Down the list Mrs. Peterson goes, students reluctantly sitting in their assigned seats next to their chemistry partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paco Fuentes,\" Mrs. Peterson says, pointing to the table behind Mary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handsome young man with pale blue eyes like his mother\u0027s and smoky black hair like his father\u0027s takes his assigned seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Peterson regards her new student over the glasses perched on her nose. \"Mr. Fuentes, don\u0027t think this class will be a piece of cake because your parents got lucky and developed a medication to halt the progression of Alzheimer\u0027s. Your father never did finish my class and he flunked one of my tests, although I have a feeling your mother was the one who should have failed. But that just means I\u0027ll expect extra from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si, senora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Peterson looks down at her notebook. \"Julianna Gallagher, please take your seat next to Mr. Fuentes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Peterson notices Julianna\u0027s blush as she sits on her stool and Paco\u0027s cocky grin beside her. Maybe the tide was starting to shift after thirty years of teaching, but she wasn\u0027t taking any chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And for those of you who want to start any trouble, I have a zero tolerance policy. . . .\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-45.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
