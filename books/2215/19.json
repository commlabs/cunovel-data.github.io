As soon as we reached the pavement, I grabbed Louis by the shoulders and spun him round to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going on with this,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going back there to tell her it will not happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, David, it will happen,\" he said without raising his voice. \"You will not stop it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized that for the first time since I\u0027d ever set eyes on him, he was passionate and angry, though the anger was not purely for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will happen,\" he repeated, clenching his teeth, his face hardening in his quiet fury. \"And we will leave her unharmed as we promised! But this will go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louis, don\u0027t you understand what she\u0027s feeling?\" I asked. \"She\u0027s falling in love with you! She\u0027ll never be the same after this. I can\u0027t let this deepen. I can\u0027t let it become any worse than it already is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not in love with me, that\u0027s wrong,\" he declared in an emphatic whisper. \"She thinks what mortals always think. We\u0027re beautiful to them. We\u0027re exotic. We have such exquisite sensitivity! I\u0027ve seen it before. All I need do is to take a victim in her presence to cure her romantic dreams. And it won\u0027t come to that, I promise you. Now, David, listen, this hour of waiting will be the longest of the night. I\u0027m thirsting. I mean to hunt. Let go of me, David. Get out of my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I didn\u0027t leave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about your emotions, Louis?\" I walked beside him, determined he wouldn\u0027t leave me behind. \"Can you tell me you\u0027re not completely taken by her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if I am, David?\" he responded, never slacking in his pace. \"David, you didn\u0027t describe her truly. You told me how strong she was, how wily, and how clever. But you didn\u0027t do justice to her.\" He gave me a shy passing glance. \"You never talked about her simplicity or her sweetness. You didn\u0027t tell me she was so inherently kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how you see her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how she is, my friend.\" Now he wouldn\u0027t look at me. \"Some school, the Talamasca, that it produced both of you. She has a patient soul and a knowing heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want this broken off now,\" I insisted. \"I don\u0027t trust either of you. Louis, listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David, do you really believe I would hurt her?\" he asked sharply. He continued walking. \"Do I seek out for my victims those whom I believe to be gentle by nature, humans I believe to be both good and uncommonly strong? She\u0027ll be safe with me forever, David, don\u0027t you understand that? Only once in my wretched life did I make a fledging and that was over a century ago. Merrick couldn\u0027t be safer from any of us than she is from me. Bind me to protect her till the day she dies and I\u0027ll probably do it! I\u0027ll slip away from her after this is done, I promise you.\" On he walked. He continued to speak: \"I\u0027ll find a way to thank her, to satisfy her, to leave her at peace. We\u0027ll do that together, David, you and I. Don\u0027t harry me now in this matter. I can\u0027t be stopped. It\u0027s gone too far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believed him. I believed him completely. \"What am I to do?\" I asked dejectedly. \"I don\u0027t even know my own heart in the matter. I\u0027m afraid for hers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re to do nothing,\" he said, his voice a little more calm than before. \"Let it happen as planned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked on through the ruined neighborhood together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the bent red neon sign of a barroom appeared, blinkering under the rangy branches of an ancient and dying tree. There were hand\u001epainted words of advertisement all over the boarded\u001eup facade, and the light inside was so feeble that scarcely anything could be seen through the dirty glass of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouis went inside and I followed him, quite amazed at the large crowd of Anglo\u001eSaxon males that chattered and drank at the long mahogany bar, and the myriad dirty little tables. Here and there were denim\u001eclad women, young and old, as were their gentlemen companions. A garish red light shone from covered bulbs near the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere I saw naked arms and dirty sleeveless shirts, secretive faces, and cynicism beneath a veil of smiles and flashing teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouis made his way to the corner of the room, and took the wooden chair beside a large unshaven and bushy\u001ehaired man who sat at a table alone and morosely over his stagnant bottle of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed, my nostrils assailed by the stench of sweat and the thick cigarette smoke. The volume of the voices was harsh, and the beat of music beneath it ugly, ugly in words and rhythm, ugly in its hostile chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down opposite the same poor degenerate mortal who cast his pale failing eyes on Louis and then on me, as though he were about to have some sport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you want, gentlemen,\" he said in a deep voice. His huge chest heaved under the worn shirt that covered it. He lifted his brown bottle and let the golden beer slide down his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, gentlemen, tell me,\" he said thickly, drunkenly. \"When men dressed like you come downtown, you want something. Now what is it? Am I saying that you came to the wrong place? Hell no, gentlemen. Somebody else might say so. Somebody else might say you\u0027ve made a bad mistake. But I\u0027m not saying it, gentlemen. I understand everything. I\u0027m all ears for the both of you. Is it broads you want, or is it a little ticket to fly?\" He smiled at both of us. \"I\u0027ve got all kinds of goodies, gentlemen. Let\u0027s pretend it\u0027s Christmas. Just tell me what\u0027s your hearts\u0027 desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed at himself proudly, then drank from his greasy brown bottle. His lips were pink, and his chin covered in a grizzled beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouis stared at him without answering. I watched in fascination. Louis\u0027s face gradually lost all expression, all semblance of feeling. It might have belonged to a dead man as he sat there, as he stared at the victim, as he marked the victim, as he let the victim lose his poor desperate humanity, as the kill passed from possible to probable and finally, to a foregone conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to kill you,\" Louis said softly. He leant forward and peered very close into the man\u0027s pale and red\u001erimmed gray eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To kill me?\" said the man, raising one eyebrow. \"You think you can do that?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do it,\" said Louis gently. \"Just like this.\" He bent and sank his teeth into the man\u0027s thick unshaven neck. I saw the man\u0027s eyes brighten for one instant as he stared over Louis\u0027s shoulder, then the eyes became fixed, and very gradually they went dull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s cumbersome and bulky body rested against Louis, his thick\u001efingered right hand quivering before it went limp beside the bot\u001ftle of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, Louis drew back and helped the man to lay his head and shoulders down on the table. Lovingly, he touched the man\u0027s thick grayish hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the street, Louis breathed deep of the fresh night air. His face was full of the blood of his victim, and richly colored with the tints of a human. He smiled a sad, bitter smile as he looked up, his eyes seeking the faintest stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agatha,\" he said softly, as if it were a prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agatha?\" I repeated. How I feared for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claudia\u0027s mother,\" he replied, looking at me. \"She said the name once in those first few nights, exactly as Merrick put it. She recited both their names, father and mother, in the manner in which she\u0027d been taught to tell strangers. Agatha was her mother\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" I replied. \"Merrick will be very pleased with that. It\u0027s the style of the old charms, you understand, when calling a spirit, to include its mother\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pity about that man drinking only beer,\" he said as we commenced our walk back to Merrick. \"I could have used just a little heat in the blood, you know, but then perhaps it\u0027s better. Better to have a strong clear mind for what happens. I believe Merrick can do what I want.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-19.html","bookId":2215,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM"}
