He said, \"You seem different today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I, Bill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Almost like another person.\" Toni said softly, \"That\u0027s because of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make me feel different.\" She touched his arm and looked into his eyes. \"You make me feel wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. You\u0027re very sexy. Do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you are. Are you married. Bill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was, once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife was mad to ever let you go. How long have you worked here, Bill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a long time. Do you ever feel you want to get out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToni lowered her voice. \"You know there\u0027s nothing really wrong with me. I admit I had a little problem when I came in, but I\u0027m cured now. I\u0027d like to get out of here, too. I\u0027ll bet you could help me. The two of us could leave here together. We\u0027d have a wonderful time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her a moment. \"I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do. Look how simple it would be. All you have to do is let me out of here one night when everyone\u0027s asleep, and we\u0027ll be on our way.\" She looked over at him and said softly, \"I\u0027ll make it worth your while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Let me think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do that,\" Toni said confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Toni returned to the room, she said to Alette, \"We\u0027re getting out of this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Ashley was escorted into Dr. Keller\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Gilbert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to try some Sodium Amytal this morning. Have you ever had it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027ll find it\u0027s very relaxing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley nodded. \"All right. I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later. Dr. Keller was talking to Toni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Toni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Dockie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you happy here, Toni?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny you should ask that. To tell you the truth, I\u0027m really beginning to like this place. I feel at home here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you want to escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToni\u0027s voice hardened. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill tells me that you asked him to help you escape from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That son of a bitch!\" There was fury in her voice. She flew out of the chair, ran over to the desk, picked up a paperweight and flung it at Dr. Keller\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ducked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll kill you, and I\u0027ll kill him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller grabbed her. \"Toni - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the expression on Ashley\u0027s face change. Toni had gone. He found that his heart was pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ashley awakened, she opened her eyes, looked around, puzzled, and said, \"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni attacked me. She was angry because I found out she was trying to escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I\u0027m sorry. I had a feeling that something bad was happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right. I want to bring you and Toni and Alette together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid. I - I don\u0027t want to meet them. Don\u0027t you understand? They\u0027re not real. They\u0027re my imagination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner or later, you\u0027re going to have to meet them, Ashley. You have to get to know one another. It\u0027s the only way you\u0027re going to be cured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley stood up. \"I want to go back to my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was returned to her room, Ashley watched the attendant leave. She was filled with a deep sense of despair. She thought. I\u0027m never going to get out of here. They\u0027re lying to me. They can\u0027t cure me. She could not face the reality that other personalities were living inside of her.... Because of them, people had been murdered, families destroyed. Why me, God? She began to weep. What did I ever do to you? She sat down on the bed and thought, I can\u0027t go on like this. There\u0027s only one way to end it. I have to do it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and walked around the small room, looking for something sharp. There was nothing. The rooms had been carefully designed so that there was nothing in them that would allow the patients to harm themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her eyes darted around the room, she saw the paints and canvas and paintbrushes and walked over to them. The handles of the paintbrushes were wooden. Ashley snapped one in half, exposing sharp, jagged edges. Slowly, she took the sharp edge and placed it on her wrist. In one fast, deep movement, she cut into her veins and her blood began to pour out. Ashley placed the jagged edge on her other wrist and repeated the movement. She stood there, watching the blood stain the carpet. She began to feel cold. She dropped to the floor and curled up into a fetal position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the room went dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dr. Gilbert Keller heard the news, he was shocked. He went to visit Ashley in the infirmary. Her wrists were heavily bandaged. Watching her lying there, Dr. Keller thought, I can\u0027t ever let this happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We almost lost you,\" he said. \"It would have made me look bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley managed a wry smile. \"I\u0027m sorry. But everything seems so - so hopeless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong,\" Dr. Keller assured her. \"Do you want to be helped, Ashley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you have to believe in me. You have to work with me. I can\u0027t do it alone. What do you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. \"What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, I want a promise from you that you\u0027ll never try to harm yourself again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get the same promise now from Toni and Alette. I\u0027m going to put you to sleep now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later. Dr. Keller was speaking to Toni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That selfish bitch tried to kill us all. She thinks only about herself. Do you see what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m not having it. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be quiet and listen to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to promise that you\u0027ll never harm Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you why. Because you\u0027re part of her. You were born out of her pain. I don\u0027t know yet what you\u0027ve had to go through, Toni, but I know that it must have been terrible. But you have to realize that she went through the same thing, and Alette was born for the same reason as you. The three of you have a lot in common. You should help each other, not hate each other. Will you give me your word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so,\" she said grudgingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Do you want to talk about England now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette. Are you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Where do you think I am, stupid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to make me the same promise that Toni did. Promise never to harm Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the only one you care about, isn\u0027t it? Ashley,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley, Ashley. What about us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe months were going by, and there were no signs of progress. Dr. Keller sat at his desk, reviewing notes, recalling sessions, trying to find a clue to what was wrong. He was taking care of half a dozen other patients, but he found that it was Ashley he was most concerned about. There was such an incredible chasm between her innocent vulnerability and the dark forces that were able to take over her life. Every time he talked to Ashley, he had an overpowering urge to try to protect her. She\u0027s like a daughter to me, he thought. Who am I kidding? I\u0027m falling in love with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller went to see Otto Lewison. \"I have a problem, Otto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that was reserved for our patients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This involves one of our patients. Ashley Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find that I\u0027m - I\u0027m very attracted to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverse transference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That could be very dangerous for both of you, Gilbert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, as long as you\u0027re aware of it... Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNOVEMBER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Ashley a diary this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you and Toni and Alette to use this, Ashley. You can keep it in your room. Anytime that any of you has any thoughts or ideas that you prefer to write down instead of talking to me, just put them down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Gilbert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA month later. Dr. Keller wrote in his diary:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDECEMBER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe treatment is at a standstill. Toni and Alette refuse to discuss the past. It is becoming more difficult to persuade Ashley to undergo hypnosis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARCH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diary is still blank. I\u0027m not sure whether the most resistance is coming from Ashley or Toni. When I do hypnotize Ashley, Toni and Alette come out very briefly. They are adamant about not discussing the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJUNE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet with Ashley regularly, but I feel there\u0027s no progress. The diary is still untouched. I have given Alette an easel and a set of paints. I am hoping that if she begins to paint, there may be a breakthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJULY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething happened, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a sign of progress. Alette painted a beautiful picture of the hospital grounds. When I complimented her on it, she seemed pleased. That evening the painting was torn to shreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller and Otto Lewison were having coffee. \"I think I\u0027m going to try a little group therapy,\" Dr. Keller said. \"Nothing else seems to be working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many patients did you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not more than half a dozen. I want her to start interacting with other people. Right now she\u0027s living in a world of her own. I want her to break out of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. It\u0027s worth a try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller led Ashley into a small meeting room. There were six people in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to meet some friends,\" Dr. Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took Ashley around the room introducing them, but Ashley was too self-conscious to listen to their names. One name blurred into the next. There was Fat Woman, Bony Man, Bald Woman, Lame Man, Chinese Woman and Gentle Man. They all seemed very pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" Bald Woman said. \"Would you like some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley took a seat. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve heard about you,\" Gentle Man said. \"You\u0027ve been through a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBony Man said, \"I guess we\u0027ve all been through a lot, but we\u0027re being helped. This place is wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have the best doctors in the world,\" Chinese Woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all seem so normal, Ashley thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller sat to one side, monitoring the conversations. Forty-five minutes later he rose. \"I think it\u0027s time to go, Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley stood up. \"It was nice meeting all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLame Man walked up to her and whispered, \"Don\u0027t drink the water here. It\u0027s poisoned. They want to kill us and still collect the money from the state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley gulped. \"Thanks. I\u0027ll -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ashley and Dr. Keller walked down the corridor, she said, \"What are their problems?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paranoia, schizophrenia, MPD, compulsive disoders. But, Ashley, their improvement since they came here has been remarkable. Would you like to chat with them regularly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller walked into Otto Lewison\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting anywhere,\" he confessed. The group therapy didn\u0027t work, and the hypnotism sessions aren\u0027t working at all. I want to try something different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your permission to take Ashley to dinner off the grounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea, Gilbert. It could be dangerous. She\u0027s already - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But right now I\u0027m the enemy. I want to become a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her alter, Toni, tried to kill you once. What if she tries again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Lewison thought about it. \"All right. Do you want someone to go with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll be fine, Otto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you want to start this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You want to take me out to dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I think it would be good for you to get away from this place for a while, Ashley. What do you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley was surprised at bow excited she was at the thought of going out to dinner with Gilbert Keller. It will be fun to get out of here for an evening, Ashley thought. But she knew that it was more than that. The thought of being with Gilbert Keller on a date was exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were having dinner at a Japanese restaurant called Otani Gardens, five miles from the hospital. Dr. Keller knew that he was taking a risk. At any moment, Toni or Alette could take over. He had been warned. It\u0027s more important that Ashley learns to trust me so that I can help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny, Gilbert,\" Ashley said, looking around the crowded restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These people don\u0027t look any different from the people at the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t really different, Ashley. I\u0027m sure they all have problems.
