That was the tradition. But it seemed strange that there was no one to see her off on this end. No one said good-bye except a few uglies passing by. They looked so young to her now, especially the just-arrived new class, who gawked at her like she was an old pile of dinosaur bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d always loved being independent, but now Tally felt like the last littlie to be picked up from school, abandoned and alone. September was a crappy month to be born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Tally, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up. It was a new ugly, awkwardly exploding into unfamiliar height, tugging at his dorm uniform like it was already too tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the one who\u0027s going to turn today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me, Shorty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how come you look so sad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally shrugged. What could this half-littlie, half-ugly understand, anyway? She thought about what Shay had said about the operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday they\u0027d taken Tally\u0027s final measurements, rolling her all the way through an imaging tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould she tell this new ugly that sometime this afternoon, her body was going to be opened up, the bones ground down to the right shape, some of them stretched or padded, her nose cartilage and cheekbones stripped out and replaced with programmable plastic, skin sanded off and reseeded like a soccer field in spring? That her eyes would be laser-cut for a lifetime of perfect vision, reflective implants inserted under the iris to add sparkling gold flecks to their indifferent brown? Her muscles all trimmed up with a night of electrocize and all her baby fat sucked out for good? Teeth replaced with ceramics as strong as a suborbital aircraft wing, and as white as the dorm\u0027s good china?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey said it didn\u0027t hurt, except the new skin, which felt like a killer sunburn for a couple of weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the details of the operation buzzed around in her head, she could imagine why Shay had run away. It did seem like a lot to go through just to look a certain way. If only people were smarter, evolved enough to treat everyone the same even if they looked different. Looked ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only Tally had come up with the right argument to make her stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe imaginary conversations were back, but much worse than they had been after Peris had left. A thousand times she\u0027d fought with Shay in her head - long, rambling discussions about beauty, biology, growing up. All those times out in the ruins, Shay had made her points about uglies and pretties, the city and the outside, what was fake and what was real. But Tally had never once realized her friend might actually run away, giving up a life of beauty, glamour, elegance. If only she\u0027d said the right thing.Any thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting here, she felt as if she\u0027d hardly tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally looked the new ugly in the eye. \"Because it all comes down to this: Two weeks of killer sunburn is worth a lifetime of being gorgeous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid scratched his head. \"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something I should have said, and didn\u0027t. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital hovercar finally came, settling onto the school grounds so lightly that it hardly disturbed the fresh-mown grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver was a middle pretty, radiating confidence and authority. He looked so much like Sol that Tally almost called her father\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tally Youngblood?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally had already seen the flash of light that had read her eye-print, but she said, \"Yes, that\u0027s me,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanyway. Something about the middle pretty made it hard to be flippant. He was wisdom personified, his manner so serious and formal that Tally found herself wishing she had dressed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready? Not taking much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer duffel bag was only half-full. Everyone knew that new pretties wound up recycling most of the stuff they brought over the river, anyway. She\u0027d have all new clothes, of course, and all the new pretty toys she wanted. All she\u0027d really kept was Shay\u0027s handwritten note, hidden among a bunch of random crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you, Tally. That\u0027s very mature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed, and the car took off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big hospital was on the bottom end of New Pretty Town. It was where everyone went for serious operations: littlies, uglies, even late pretties from way out in Crumblyville coming in for life-extension treatments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe river was sparkling under a cloudless sky, and Tally allowed herself to be swept away by the beauty of New Pretty Town. Even without the nighttime lights and fireworks, the city\u0027s surfaces shone with glass and metal, the unlikely spindles of party towers casting thin shadows across the island. It was so much more vibrant than the Rusty Ruins, Tally suddenly saw. Not as dark and mysterious, perhaps, but more alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to stop sulking about Shay. Life was going to be one big party from now on, full of beautiful people. Like Tally Youngblood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hovercar descended onto one of the redX s on the hospital roof, and Tally\u0027s driver escorted her inside, taking her to a waiting room. An orderly looked up Tally\u0027s name, flashed her eye again, and told her to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be okay?\" the driver asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up into his clear, soft eyes, wanting him to stay. But asking him to wait with her didn\u0027t seem very mature. \"No, I\u0027m fine. Thanks.\" He smiled and went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else was in the waiting room. Tally settled back and counted the tiles on the ceiling. As she waited, the conversations with Shay in her head came back again, but they weren\u0027t so troubling here. It was too late for second thoughts now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally wished there was a window to look out onto New Pretty Town. She was so close now. She imagined tomorrow night, her first night pretty, dressed in new and wonderful clothes (her dorm uniforms all shoved down the recycler), looking out from the top of the highest party tower she could find. She would watch as lights-out fell across the river, bedtime for Uglyville, and know that she still had all night with Peris and her new friends, all the beautiful people she would meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixteen years. Finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened for a long hour. Tally drummed her fingers, wondering if they always kept uglies waiting this long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the man came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked strange, unlike any pretty Tally had ever seen. He was definitely of middle age, but whoever had done his operation had botched it. He was beautiful, without a doubt, but it was a terrible beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of wise and confident, the man looked cold, commanding, intimidating, like some regal animal of prey. When he walked up, Tally started to ask what was going on, but a glance from him silenced her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never met an adult who affected her this way. She always felt respect when face-to-face with a middle or late pretty. But in the presence of this cruelly beautiful man, respect was saturated with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said, \"There\u0027s a problem with your operation. Come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-12.html","bookId":1573,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM"}
