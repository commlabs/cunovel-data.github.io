Later. Save all the jokes and we\u0027ll go over them one by one in a big heap. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word came through: \"Sir, Proteus reports DANGEROUS AIR LOSS. REFUELING OPERATION CARRIED THROUGH SUCCESSFULLY.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Refueling?\" cried Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid said, frowning, \"I suppose they mean the lungs. They\u0027re at the lungs, after all, and that means cubic miles of air on their scale. But ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t use that air. It\u0027s unminiaturized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter looked at the colonel in, exasperation. He barked into the transmitter. \"Repeat the last sentence of the message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"REFUELING OPERATION CARRIED THROUGH SUCCESSFULLY.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that last word `successfully\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in touch with them and confirm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to Reid, \"If they say `successfully,\u0027 I suppose they handled it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid nodded his head. He looked up at the Time Recorder, which read 37, and said, \"The pleural lining is a double membrane surrounding the lungs. They must be moving in the space between; a, clear road, an expressway really, right to the neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027ll be where they started half an hour ago,\" grated Carter. \"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can back into a capillary and find their way to the carotid artery again, which is time-consuming; or they may by-pass the arterial system by taking to the lymphatics, which involves other problems. -Michaels is the pilot; I suppose he\u0027ll know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you advise him? For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t rest on protocol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid shook his head. \"I\u0027m not sure which course is wisest, and he\u0027s on the scene. He\u0027ll be a better judge as to how well the ship can withstand another arterial battering. We\u0027ve got to leave it to them, general.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I knew what to do,\" said Carter. \"By the Lord, I\u0027d take the responsibility, if I knew enough to do so with a reasonable chance of success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s exactly how I feel,\" said Reid, \"and why I\u0027m declining the responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels was looking over the charts, \"All right, Owens, this wasn\u0027t the place I was heading for, but it will do. We\u0027re here and we\u0027ve made an opening. Head for the crevice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into the lungs? said Owens, in outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\" Michaels bounded from his seat in impatience and climbed the stairs so that his head poked into the bubble. \"We\u0027ll get into the pleural lining. Get the ship going and I\u0027ll guide you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora knelt at Grant\u0027s chair. \"How did you manage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"Barely. I\u0027ve been scared more times than I can count-I\u0027m a very scary person-but this time I nearly set a record for fright-intensity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you always make yourself out to be such a coward? After all, your job ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m an agent? Most of it is pretty routine, pretty safe, pretty dull; and I try to keep it that way. When I can\u0027t avoid frightening situations, I have to endure them for the sake of what I believe I\u0027m doing. I\u0027m sufficiently brainwashed, you know, to think it the patriotic thing-in a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my way. It\u0027s not just this country or that, after all. We\u0027re long past the stage where there can be a meaningful division of humanity. I honestly believe our policies are intended to uphold the peace and I want to be part, however small, of that upholding. I didn\u0027t volunteer for this mission, but now that I\u0027m here ...\" He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora said, \"You sound as though you\u0027re embarrassed to be talking about peace and patriotism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"I suppose I am. The rest of you are driven by specific motivation, not by vague words. Owens is testing his ship; Michaels is piloting a course across a human body; Duval is admiring God\u0027s handiwork; and you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said softly, \"You are admiring Duval.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora flushed. \"He\u0027s worth admiration, he really is. You know, after he suggested we shine the ship\u0027s headlights into the crevice so as to give you something to shoot for, he did nothing further. He wouldn\u0027t say a word to you on your return. It\u0027s his way. He\u0027ll save someone\u0027s life, then be casually rude to him and what will be remembered will be his rudeness and not his life-saving. But his manner doesn\u0027t alter what he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That\u0027s true; though it may mask it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your manner doesn\u0027t affect what you are. You affect a brittle, adolescent humor in order to mask a deep involvement in humanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Grant\u0027s turn to redden. \"You make me sound an uncommon jackass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To yourself perhaps. In any case, you\u0027re not a coward. But now I\u0027ve got to get to work on the laser.\" She cast a quick glance at Michaels, who was returning to his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The laser? Good Lord, I\u0027d forgotten. Well, then, do your best to see it\u0027s not crucially damaged, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animation that had brightened her through the previous conversation died away. \"Oh, if I only could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to the rear\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels\u0027 eyes followed her. \"What about the laser?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant shook his head. \"She\u0027s going to check now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels seemed to hesitate before his next remark. He shook his head slightly. Grant watched him but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels settled himself into his seat and said at last, \"What do you think of our present situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant, until now absorbed in Cora, looked up at the windows. They seemed to be moving between two parallel walls that almost touched the Proteus on either side; gleaming yellow and constructed of parallel fibers, like huge tree trunks bound side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fluid about them was clear, free of cells and objects, almost free of debris. It seemed to be in dead calm and the Proteus churned through it at an even, rapid clip with only the muffled Brownian motion to interject any unevenness into its progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Brownian motion,\" said Grant, \"is rougher now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fluid here is less viscous than the blood plasma so the motion is less damped out. We won\u0027t be here long, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not in the blood-stream, I take it, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it look like it? This is the space between the folds of the pleural membrane that lines the lungs. The membrane on that side is fixed to the ribs. In fact, we ought to be able to see a huge gentle bulge when we pass one of them. The other membrane is fixed to the lungs. If you want the names, they are the parietal pleura and the pulmonary pleura, respectively.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really want the names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t really think you did. What we\u0027re in now is a film of lubricating moisture between the pleura. When the lungs expand during inhalation or contact during exhalation, they move against the ribs and this fluid cushions and smooths the motion. There\u0027s so thin a film that the folds of the pleura are commonly considered in contact in the healthy body, but being, germ-size we can sneak between the folds through the film of fluid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the lung wall moves along the rib-cage, doesn\u0027t that affect us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are alternately hurried along slightly and held back slightly. Not enough to matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" said Grant. \"Have these membranes anything to do with pleurisy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They surely do. When the pleura are infected and inflamed, every breath becomes an agony, and coughing ..: \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if Benes coughs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels shrugged. \"In our position now, I suppose it would be fatal. We\u0027d come apart. There\u0027s no reason for coughing, however. He\u0027s under hypothermia and in deep sedation and his pleura-take my word for it-is in good condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if we irritate them ..: \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re too small to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can speak only in terms of probabilities. The probability of a cough now is too small to worry about.\" His face was quite calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" said Grant, and looked back to see what Cora was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Duval were in the work-room; both heads bent closely over the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant rose and went to the doorway. Michaels joined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a section of opal glass, illuminated from below into bright milkiness, the laser lay disassembled, each part etched sharp and clear against the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the total damages now?\" demanded Duval, crisply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just those items, doctor, and this broken trigger-wire. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThoughtfully, Duval seemed to be counting the parts, touching each with a delicate finger and moving it. \"The key to the situation then is this smashed transistor. What it amounts to is that there\u0027s no way now to fire the lamp, and that\u0027s the end of the laser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant interrupted. \"Are there no spare parts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora looked up. Her glance drifted guiltily away from Grant\u0027s firm eyes. She said, \"Not anything built into the chassis. We should have brought a second laser but who could have ... If it hadn\u0027t come loose ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, somberly, \"Are you serious, Dr. Duval? Is the laser unusable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA note of impatience crept into Duval\u0027s voice. \"I\u0027m always serious. Now don\u0027t bother me.\" He seemed lost in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels shrugged. \"That\u0027s it, then. We\u0027ve gone through the heart, and we\u0027ve filled our air chambers at the lungs, and all for nothing. We can\u0027t go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" demanded Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, we can go on as a matter of physical ability. It\u0027s just that there\u0027s no point in it, Grant. Without a laser, there\u0027s nothing we can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"Dr. Duval, is there any way of performing the operation without the laser?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking,\" snapped Duval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then share your thoughts,\" snapped back Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval looked up. \"No, there\u0027s no way of performing the operation without the laser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But operations were performed for centuries without a laser. You cut through the lung wall with your knife; that was an operation. Can\u0027t you cut away the clot with your knife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I can, but not without damaging the nerve and placing an entire lobe of the brain in danger. The laser is incredibly more delicate than the knife. In this particular case, a knife would be butchery compared with a laser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can save Benes\u0027 life with the knife, can\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, just maybe. I can\u0027t necessarily save his mind, however. In fact, I should think it almost certain that an operation with a knife would bring Benes through with serious mental deficiencies. Is that what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant rubbed his chin. \"I\u0027ll tell you. We\u0027re heading for that clot. When we get there, if all we\u0027ve got is a knife, you\u0027ll use a knife, Duval. If we lose our knives, you\u0027ll use your teeth, Duval. If you don\u0027t, I will. We may fail, but we won\u0027t quit. Meanwhile, let\u0027s look at it ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed between Duval and Cora and picked up the \u0027transistor which lay neatly on the tip of his first finger. \"Is this the broken one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Cora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If this were fixed or replaced, could you make the laser operate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but there\u0027s no way of fixing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose you had another transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire. Could you piece it together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I could. It requires such absolute precision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you couldn\u0027t, but what about you, Dr. Duval? Your surgeon\u0027s fingers might be able to do it despite the Brownian motion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could try, with Miss Peterson\u0027s help. But we don\u0027t have the parts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"Yes, we do. I can supply them.\" He seized a heavy metal screw-driver and moved purposefully back into the front compartment. He went to his wireless and without hesitation began to unscrew the panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels moved behind him, seizing his elbow. \"What are you doing, Grant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant shook himself free, \"I\u0027m getting at its guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you\u0027re going to dismantle the wireless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a transistor and a wire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ll be out of communication with the outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the time come to take us out of Benes . . . Grant, listen ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, impatiently, \"No. They can follow us through our radioactivity. The wireless is just for idle talk and we can do without. We have to, in fact. It\u0027s either radio silence or Benes\u0027 death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, you\u0027d better call Carter and put it to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant thought briefly. \"I\u0027ll call him. But only to tell him there\u0027ll be no further messages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he orders you to make ready for withdrawal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll refuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he orders you ..:\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can withdraw us by force, but without my cooperation. As long as we\u0027re aboard the Proteus, I make the policy decisions. We\u0027ve gone through too much now to quit, so we go forward to the clot, whatever happens and whatever Carter orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter shouted, \"Repeat last message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CANNIBALIZING WIRELESS TO REPAIR LASER. THIS IS LAST MESSAGE.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid said, blankly, \"They\u0027re breaking communication.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter said, \"What happened to the laser?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter sat down heavily. \"Have coffee brought up here, will you, Don? If I thought I could get away with it, I\u0027d ask for a double scotch and soda, and then two more. We\u0027re jinxed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid had signalled for coffee. He said, \"Sabotage, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sabotage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and don\u0027t play innocent, general. You anticipated the possibility from the start, or why send Grant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After what happened to Benes on the way here . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And I don\u0027t particularly trust Duval or the girl, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all right,\" said Carter, with a grimace. \"They\u0027ve got to be. Everyone here has to be right. There is no way to make security more secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. No security procedure lends absolute certainty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All these people work here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Grant,\" said Reid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grant doesn\u0027t work here. He\u0027s an outsider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter smiled spasmodically. \"He\u0027s a government agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid said, \"I know. And agents can play double games. You put Grant on the Proteus and a string of bad luck begins-or what looks like bad luck ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee had come. Carter said, \"That\u0027s ridiculous. I know the man. He\u0027s no stranger to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was the last time you saw him? What do you know about his inner life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it. It\u0027s impossible.\" But Carter stirred the cream into his coffee with a marked uneasiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid said, \"All right. Just thinking out loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter said, \"Are they still in the pleura?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter looked at the Time Recorder, which said 32, and shook his head in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant had the wireless in fragments before him. Cora looked at the transistors one after the other, turning them, weighing them, seeming almost to peer within them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one,\" she said, doubtfully, \"will do, I think, but that wire is much too thick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval placed the wire under question on the illuminated opal glass and placed the damaged fragment of original wire next to it, comparing them with somber eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"There\u0027s nothing closer. You\u0027ll have to make it do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easy to say that,\" said Cora. \"You can give me an order like that, but you can\u0027t give such an order to the wire. It won\u0027t work no matter how hard you shout at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. All right.\" Grant tried to think and got nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval said, \"Now wait. With luck, I may be able to scrape it thin enough. , Miss Peterson, get me a number eleven scalpel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed the wire from what had been Grant\u0027s device (now wireless in literal truth) in two small clamps and swung a magnifying glass before it. He reached out for the scalpel which Cora placed within his grip and slowly, he began to scrape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up, he said, \"Kindly take your seat, Grant. You cannot help me by snorting over my shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant flinched a little, caught Cora\u0027s look of appeal. He said nothing and moved back to his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels, in his seat, greeted him humorlessly. \"The surgeon is at work,\" he said. \"The scalpel is in his hand and his temperament is at once at its full bent. Don\u0027t waste your time being angry with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"I\u0027m not angry with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, \"Of course you are, unless you\u0027re prepared to tell me you\u0027ve resigned from the human race. Duval has the gift-the God-given gift, I\u0027m sure he would say-of antagonizing people with a single word, a glance, a gesture. And if that weren\u0027t enough, there is the young lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant turned to Michaels with clear impatience. \"What about the young lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now, Grant. Do you want a lecture on boys and girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant frowned and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said softly, rather sadly, \"You\u0027re in a quandary about her, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What quandary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a nice girl, very good-looking. And yet you\u0027re a professionally suspicious person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well! What happened to the laser? Was it an accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it could have been.\" Michaels\u0027 voice was a bare whisper. \"But was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant whispered, too, after a quick glance over his shoulder. \"Are you accusing Miss Peterson of sabotaging the mission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. I have no evidence of that. But I suspect you are accusing her in your mind and you don\u0027t like to be doing so. Hence the quandary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Miss Peterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Nobody would pay any attention to her if she were seen fiddling with the laser. It is her province. And if she were intent on sabotage, she would naturally gravitate to that part of the mission with which she felt most at home-the laser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which would place immediate and automatic suspicion upon her-as it seems to have done,\" said Grant, with some heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. You are angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"Look. We\u0027re all in one relatively small ship and you might think that we were each of us under the close and constant observation of the others, but that\u0027s not so. We\u0027ve been so absorbed with what\u0027s out there, all of us, that any one of us could have walked back to the storage compartment and done anything he wanted to the laser and done so unnoticed. You or I might have done it. I wouldn\u0027t have seen you. You wouldn\u0027t have seen me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Duval?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Duval. I\u0027m not eliminating him. Or it might have been an honest accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your lifeline coming loose? Another accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you prepared to suggest anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not. I can point out a few things, if you\u0027re in the mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not, but point them out anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Duval who secured your lifeline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And apparently made a poor knot, I suppose,\" said Grant. \"Still there was considerable tension of the line. Considerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A surgeon should be able to tie knots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nonsense. Surgical knots are not sailors\u0027 knots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps. On the other hand, maybe the knot was deliberately tied so as to come loose. Or perhaps it could have been untied by hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant nodded. \"All right. But there again, everyone had their attention on what was going on about them. You, or Duval, or Miss Peterson, might have moved quickly back to the ship, loosened the knot, and returned without being noticed. Even \u0027 Owens might have left the ship for the purpose, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but Duval had the best chance. Just before you broke loose, he went back to the ship, carrying the snorkel. He said the lifeline came loose as he watched. We know by his own admission that he was in the right place at the right time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it might still have been an accident. What\u0027s his motive? The laser had already been sabotaged, and all he could accomplish by loosening the lifeline would be to endanger me personally. If he was after the mission, why bother with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Grant! Oh, Grant!\" Michaels smiled and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, talk. Don\u0027t just grunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose it was the young lady who took care of the laser. And suppose Duval\u0027s interest was specifically you; suppose he wanted to get rid of you, with damage to the mission strictly secondary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant stared speechlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels went on. \"Duval is perhaps not so entirely devoted to his work that he doesn\u0027t notice his assistant seems aware of your existence. You are a fine-looking young man, Grant, and you have saved her serious injury at the time of the whirlpool; perhaps even her life. Duval watched that and he must have watched her reaction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no reaction. She\u0027s not interested in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watched her when you were lost in the alveolus. She was distraught. What was obvious to anyone then, might have been obvious to Duval much sooner-that she was attracted to you. And he might have gotten rid of you for that reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant bit at his lower lip in thought, then said, \"All right. And the loss of air. Was that an accident, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I suspect you will suggest that Owens might have been responsible for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might. He knows the ship. He designed it. He can best gimmick its controls. And only he checked on what was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, you know. That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And for that matter,\" went on Grant with gathering anger, \"what about the arterio-venous fistula? Was that an accident, or did you know it was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels sat back in his chair and looked blank. \"Good Lord, I hadn\u0027t thought of that. I give you my word, Grant, I sat here and honestly thought there wasn\u0027t a thing that happened that could possibly point in my direction specifically. I realized that it could be maintained that I had slyly damaged the laser or undone your lifeline knot or jammed the air chamber valve when no one was looking-or all three, for that matter. But in each case it was so much more likely that someone else had done it. The fistula, I admit, could be no one but myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except, of course, that I didn\u0027t know it was there. But I can\u0027t prove that, can I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, \"Do you ever read detective stories, Grant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my younger days I read quite a few. Now ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your profession spoils the fun. Yes, I can well imagine that. But you know, in detective stories, it is always so simple. A subtle clue points to one person and one person only and the detective sees it though no one else does. In real life, it seems, the clues point everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or nowhere,\" said Grant, firmly. \"We could be dealing with a series of accidents and misfortunes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could,\" conceded Michaels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither, however, sounded very convincing. -Or convinced. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fantastic-voyage/page-13.html","bookId":1750,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:24 AM"}
