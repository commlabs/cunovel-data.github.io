(3)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for a Heavenly Beast as powerful as the Silver Emperor, with its cultivation level, without being able to use any Skills and numbed by the Lightning Suffering, it was difficult to even muster its own Heavenly Energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next instant, the second Skill imbued within Zhou Weiqing’s arrow activated. To be more accurate, both the second and third Skills activated at the same time in a fusion Skill. The Silver Emperor’s own famed Skill, the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend Slash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn ear piercing explosion, as this too was Zhou Weiqing’s greatest offensive Skill, exploding with full effect on the Silver Emperor which had just been struck hard by Shangguan Fei’er. It gave a loud shriek as silver feathers fell from its body. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs soon as Zhou Weiqing had let loose of the arrow, he had dismissed his Overlord Bow and charged forward with all his might. Without hesitation, he renewed the Dragon Silencing Seal on the Silver Emperor, not caring about wastage at this moment. At the same time, the Giant Spirit Yang Palm of his right hand grabbed onto the Silver Emperor’s body. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Devour Skill activated instantly, and simultaneously, Zhou Weiqing’s left hand, encased with the Giant Spirit Ying Palm, also slammed hard on the Silver Emperor. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s current action now was just too sly and even ironic, almost derisive. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat fellow was Devouring the Silver Emperor’s Heavenly Energy with his right hand, before quickly using its own Energy to pump out a Skill from his left. More so, he was using the Silver Emperor’s own Spatial Rend!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, even this powerful and tough Silver Emperor was no longer able to handle such abuse. After three, four hits, it was knocked unconscious by Zhou Weiqing, with most of its Heavenly Energy Devoured as well. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was only then that Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief, relaxing a little. If this Silver Emperor had managed to charge into the midst of his companions, who knows how many deaths would have occurred. Tossing the Silver Emperor to Shangguan Fei’er, he said angrily: “Didn’t you say that there were no powerful Heavenly Beasts in this Ghost Demon Forest? What’s this?!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er pursed her lips and said: “How could I know? The Silver Emperor definitely does not live here, they are all from the north east, still beyond the northern border. Occasionally a Silver Emperor might wander the mainland due to unique circumstances, but that is rare and far between. How could I know that our luck would be so bad, to actually meet one which is wandering the mainland.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “You still dare say? This fellow was obviously drawn here by your cries earlier!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er glared at him, her eyes wide opened: “You!! I haven’t dealt with you yet for that, and you still dare to bring it up?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe two of them stood there arguing, while at the other side, the others stood staring at them in shock. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaturally, they were not shocked because of the two of them arguing, but because of the sheer power the pair had just shown.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZang Lang and the others might not know what type of Heavenly Beast the Silver Emperor actually was, but it did not change the fact that they could sense how terrifying it was. All of them had witnessed that sheer speed of that silver glow in the sky, the intense pressure that caused their legs to feel like jelly even at such a distance. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis beautiful young lady who had followed them all the way… who had not displayed anything else on the road besides her beauty and mischievous nature, was actually a Upper level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master! Heavens! Her Physical Jewel… was double the usual amount?! Her power was just too terrifying!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the same time, Zang Lang and the others had also noticed Zhou Weiqing’s four sets of Heavenly Jewels, adding on to that terrifying Skill that they did not know the name of. At this moment, they truly understood how powerful this young boss that they were following. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the other hand, Zang Lang and the rest might not recognize the Silver Emperor, but Lin TianAo and the other Fei Li Battle Team members certainly did, and they had a clear judgement about the Silver Emperor’s power. This Silver Emperor might not have reached the Heavenly King Stage yet, but amongst all Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, it was already considered one of the top, with its speed and terrifying offense. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEspecially that offensive power. The original Fei Li Battle Team members were extremely clear about how strong Lin TianAo’s Assembly Shield Set was, especially after he had reached the sixth Jewel, its defense had increased several fold once more. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDespite that, his shield had been destroyed in a single blow. From that, one could tell how horrifying the attack of that Silver Emperor had been. Yet, such a powerful Heavenly Beast had been taken down by Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er in such a short time, with only that tiny help from in TianAo. These two were just too unbelievable. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn truth, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er had expended everything they had in that fight. The fight might have seemed quick and easy, but in just that short period of time, Zhou Weiqing had used up all of his Heavenly Energy, even the large amount he had Devoured. Shangguan Fei’er was slightly better off than him, but she had also unleashed all of her Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment. Of absolute importance was also that single block of Lin TianAo’s shield, which was only a seemingly tiny contribution, but critical in allowing them to accomplish it all; otherwise, even if they managed to beat the Silver Emperor in the end, Shangguan Fei’er would have taken critical damage. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFinally, Lin TianAo gave the order to the others. “Alright, it’s over. Everyone, let’s go back to rest.” As such, the rest of them returned to the their camp, leaving Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er to their own devices. Lin TianAo would not even attempt to think of intervening. After all, with their relationship, nothing really big would come out of it. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So, we’re even now, alright?” Zhou Weiqing was no longer willing to continue arguing with her, and he took the initiative to say it. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er gave and angry humph, looking up into the sky. The intense fight earlier had lessened the embarrassment she had been feeling previously, but even now when she thought of that evil looking thing, her heartbeat couldn’t help but start beating faster. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “I have discovered that close combat skills are really useful indeed. Who knows, I might meet an opponent with powerful Control Skills and need that. Every bit of power and ability has a time and use. Can you teach me please?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er’s eyes lit up, and she looked at him, saying: “You really want to learn?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er shook the Silver Emperor in her hand and said: “Learning close combat has to start from being beaten up.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “What? Didn’t you already beat me up just now? What about the Silver Emperor, why do we do with it? Do we just kill it off?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er said: “You have the Darkness Attribute, don’t you have any Darkness Skills? If you can Seal it, that’d be great. Although this Silver Emperor has not evolved into a Heavenly King Stage yet, it is still worth a lot. Next time when you come to our Heavenly Jewel island, you can sell it off there. We have a lot of requirements for any high stage Heavenly Beasts.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s interest was sparked, and he said: “I do have a Sealing Skill, the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlood Rites - Seal of Darkness. Will that work?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er said in surprise: “You actually have that Skill? If you can actually succeed in Sealing it, you might actually be able control that Silver Emperor. However, its cultivation level is just too far ahead of yours, I don’t know if you can actually succeed!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing walked up to Shangguan Fei’er and said: “You’ll never know if you don’t try.” He had after all even Skill Stored a Heavenly Emperor Stage Beast, and this Silver Emperor was only at the Zong Stage, albeit at the maximum. In terms of cultivation level difference, he was not too worried. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er looked at him disdainfully, before saying: “Don’t be too overconfident, With your Heavenly Energy, you still want to enslave the Silver Emperor?” She did not know why, but whenever she could succeed in knocking him down, Shangguan Fei’er felt a strange happiness. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLooking at her with a provoking gaze, he said: “If I were to succed in Sealing? What do you say? Do you dare bet with me?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er thought about it for awhile, before saying with interest: “What do you want to bet?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin TianAo were here, he would immediately think that this Zhou Weiqing was going to take advantage of others by betting once again. Both he and Yun Li had lost to Zhou Weiqing just like this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “If you lose, then you’ll have to marry me along with Bing’er. If I lose, then I’ll marry into the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to you and Bing’er. How about that?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Get lost!” Shangguan Fei’er said angrily, giving him a kick. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily, jumping back and avoiding her kick skillfully. “You are the one who asked me what to bet, I’m just speaking the truth.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er said huffily: “You already have Bing’er and you’re not satisfied? Trying to take advantage of me, stop dreaming! Even if I have to marry a pig, I won’t marry you!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a humph and said: “As if I want it that much! What do you want to bet then?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er’s eyes spun in their sockets and she said cunningly: “How about this, if you do not succeed, when we return to the camp, you act as my horse. If you succeed, I’ll forgive you for what you did earlier.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “You are still trying to take advantage.” Thinking about her riding on him like a horse, that taut little buttocks of hers in contact with himself once more, he couldn’t help but feel his body heating up, and his eyes naturally fluttered to the abovementioned portion. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What are you looking at?!” Shangguan Fei’er said angrily. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing changed the topic hastily: “Are you going to bet or not? If you want to bet, it has to be fair stakes. How about this, if you win, we’ll do as you say and I’ll act like a horse for you. If you lose, I’ll get to smack your bottom ten times to assuage my anger.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Scoundrel!” Shangguan Fei’er flushed deeply as she snapped. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing said naturally with a beatific smile: “How did you know my middle name? So, do you want to bet or not? Make up your mind!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er thought about it for a moment, but she just could not see how Zhou Weiqing, at the four-Jeweled stage, could possibly Seal the Silver Emperor. After all, no matter how powerful Darkness Seals were, they would still be restricted by Heavenly Energy levels. As long as there was a difference of more than five levels of Heavenly Energy, it was already nearly impossible to successfully Seal… and the difference between Zhou Weiqing and the Silver Emperor was almost twenty levels! Unless there was some miracle, she could not see any possibility of success.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThinking about a win and how she could get her revenge on Zhou Weiqing, letting him lose face in front of all his companions, Shangguan Fei’er immediately felt better. Gritting her teeth, she said: “Alright, I’ll bet with you.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing glanced at her appealing little bottom again, grinning as he said: “Heh heh, alright, you watch and see then.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he said that, he grabbed the Silver Emperor in one hand before crouching down. All this while, he had not dismissed the Demonic Change State, and currently, with his right foot on the Silver Emperor, he took a deep breath to regain his Heavenly Energy and smoothen his meridians before starting on his action. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-14-chapter-117-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-14-chapter-118-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-14-chapter-117-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
