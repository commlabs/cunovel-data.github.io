Our shoulders touched. If they were going to shoot the man, they’d have to be content with a leg shot—or shooting through one of us. The tweed of his coat rasped against my upper arm where my sleeve ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The seventeenth is coming, Doctor. Did you tithe yet?” the gunman asked of Dr. Tovar, jerking his chin up slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t have him,” Dr. Tovar stated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not an answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your answer is tell Maldonado to go fuck himself,” Dr. Tovar said, his voice frighteningly calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first gunman started forward, and the second swatted out a hand to hold him back. Their faces were as cold-blooded as any vampire as they contemplated shooting Dr. Tovar and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second one released the first. “Come on. He’ll come out eventually,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll shoot you in the street, like a dog,” the first threatened, staring at Dr. Tovar, lowering his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they retreated, the door closing behind them, taking the sunlight and shadows with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grandmother went on a tirade. “¡Rezo y rezo y sigue siendo lo mismo!” Then she stood up and left the waiting room, clearly disgusted with all of us equally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to run after her and ask her who she was talking about, how she knew anything about Santa Muerte—I didn’t get to ask many questions back in December when I was being shunned out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was helping Dr. Tovar. I looked over to him, and he nodded at me. “Let’s get him up and into the back room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did so, with the help of the man he’d come in with. One of the receptionists held open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to make eye contact with Dr. Tovar while we were involved in the process of cleaning up our patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the man’s shirt came off, I could see that he was covered in grim prison-looking tattoos. He talked angrily to his friend, but mostly in Spanish, so it wasn’t illuminating. And Tovar ignored any pointed looks I gave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I was trying to say with my eyeballs was, Are you going to report this? I knew we were supposed to report all gunshot wounds that anyone received to the police. And keep the bullets too. But now wasn’t the time, not in front of the patient, and this was not my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you go to my office, Miss Spence,” Tovar said when he was almost done. I inhaled to argue, and then remembered the wisdom of not doing so for once. I took off my gloves, washed my hands, and went outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured it was going to take him a while to clean up, and I owed it to myself to see if the elderly woman had come back. I went up to the hallway door, looked around at the waiting room through the thin pane of wire glass, and didn’t see anyone out there but a janitor scrubbing at the bloodstain on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried the handle and stepped out, keeping the door open with my foot. I looked around the room until I was confident I’d seen it all and gave the janitor a shy wave for interrupting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman was gone. Damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Santa Muerte an actual saint to that woman? Or a personal friend? A concept—or an entity? I wished she was still around to ask, or that the Shadows’ request had been more specific. They could have at least given me a Wheel of Fortune clue. If finding Santa Muerte—the person, place, or thing—would make them heal my mom, then somehow I would. I quietly walked back down the hall to Dr. Tovar’s office to wait for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took an hour for him to finish up, which I used to confirm that the medical books on the shelves were actually old. Not spirits and humours old, but close. I hoped they weren’t using them for modern medical advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched the skin on my shoulder where his coat had scratched against it. Hard to believe that the man who’d been dismissing me so analytically this morning was that passionate about saving his patients. And yet— There was a cough from the hallway outside that let me know I’d been caught snooping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. I’m naturally curious.” I stepped back around the desk as Dr. Tovar came in. “What was all that about?” I asked, making guns with my thumbs and forefingers, and shooting them at the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turf wars.” He looked like he didn’t know how to explain it to me. He was angry still, but holding it in. I could almost see it surge underneath his skin. If he’d been a were, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see him change. He sat down, exterior calm, and I did the same. “It’s an election year. The current mayor’s cracking down on crime at the edges of our side of town. Less space, more pressure. It’s like putting the lid on a boiling pot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do people come here like that often?” I turned one of my imaginary handguns to shoot my own shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Often enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you don’t call for outside help?” Might as well be fearless about questions; I’d already been unhired for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a reason they don’t call nine-one-one, you know.” The anger in his face relaxed to make his dark eyes look weary instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if that’d been worse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’d call. We’re a clinic, not an emergency department. I wouldn’t let him die over his or my pride.” He shrugged. “Do you bring gloves everywhere you go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Hand sanitizer too. The world’s a disgusting place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe agreed with a snort, and appeared to be studying the top of his desk, thinking hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is Maldonado?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question made him glance up at me. He began shaking his head, frowning deeply. “You saw things you shouldn’t have today, Nurse Spence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I might not have heard that particular line before, boy, had I heard others just like it. I held my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose you think I have to hire you now. Or you’ll tell people how I run things down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I might not have been above blackmail for a good reason, getting a job was not one of them. “No. I don’t think that at all. I’m not judging you in the least.” His eyes narrowed as I went on. “I’ve had to work at some … interesting places before. Ones I couldn’t really put on my résumé.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows rose. “Being a witness to attempted murder doesn’t put you off?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he only knew the kinds of secrets I’d had to keep. “Without going into details—trust me. I’ve seen worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head forward. “That’s funny. You look like the kind of person who goes talking to police.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m confused—do you want me to be incredibly honorable and report you to authorities and not get hired? Or do you want me to be useful, morally hazy, and gainfully employed? Because personally I like the one where I wind up with a job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt my protest, his face had the smallest flicker of a smile. “You do seem to understand some of our natural expediencies, and actually have basic nursing skills. Those things might be more valuable to me than you speaking Spanish, the way our summer’s going so far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted at him. “Are you offering to hire me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. If you want it, against my better judgment, the job’s yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what I’d wanted, right? But now—like so many other times before—it wasn’t how I’d wanted it. Still, this place was my only link to Santa Muerte, whoever or whatever she may be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, so now you’re wise enough to be scared?” he asked, sounding smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I even answer that? “I want the job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you tomorrow then. At eight A.M.,” he said, and pointed toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I was halfway down the hall when I realized he’d never given me an answer about Maldonado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiting room was still empty when I reached it, although the janitor was done. Maybe that woman would be back tomorrow. She’d called out to Santa Muerte like she knew her personally—in prayer, no less. Rosary and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePraying while using a rosary smacked of comfortable familiarity. If even one person knew of a Santa Muerte, no matter who or what that was, there were bound to be others. I’d just have to find them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same early-teens kid from before blocked my path. “Oh, lady, you still need a limpieza. Bad. I have the don, I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can I need that if I don’t even know what that is?” There was drying blood on the ground outside too, slightly darker than the rest of the surrounding stains on the cement. I wondered if the janitor had even tried to clean it up out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My grandfather, Don Pedrito, he can heal you.” He patted his chest with authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look.” He was thin, rail-thin, with wrists that my hands could wrap around, the fingers meeting and then some. “I don’t have any money. But tomorrow I’ll be here. I’ll bring you a sandwich.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his head back as though he’d been hit. “I don’t need your charity!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I don’t need your limp-pizza. Whatever the hell that is.” I stepped around the blood on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll need it eventually. You have a curse on you. You’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe tomorrow. But not tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heaved a sigh and glared at me. I shrugged and walked around him, and then walked the two blocks back to the train station in the daylight. I wasn’t scared in the crowd anymore. I felt alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when I got home I called up the sleep clinic to officially quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt substantially less alive at six thirty the next morning. I’d gone to sleep easily enough, thanks again to Ambien. But six thirty was early enough to make me feel frail. I got out of bed like the floor might roll away from me, then stumbled up to make coffee, take a shower, and head out the door. I remembered to make a sandwich for myself before I left, and an extra sandwich for that kid too. I could eat it later if I didn’t see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tempted to call my mom from the train, to make plans to see her tonight, but I didn’t know what her sleep schedule was like. I made a mental note to call her later. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shapeshifted-edie-spence-3/page-6.html","bookId":2620,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:26 PM"}
