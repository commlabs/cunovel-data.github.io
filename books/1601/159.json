Egwene ignored them. They stood near several pairs of sul\u0027dam and damane. If she let those pairs draw her attention, her temper might get the better of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have considered myself\", Egwene said, \"whether it would be appropriate to speak to one such as yourself, who has committed such terrible atrocities\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have decided that I will speak to you\", Fortuona continued, ignoring Egwene’s remark. \"I think that, for the time, it would be better if I see you not as marath’damane, but as a queen among the people of this land\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\", Egwene said. \"You will see me for what I am, woman. I demand it\". Fortuona pursed her lips. \"Very well\", she finally said. \"I have spoken to damane before; training them has been a hobby of mine. To see you as such does not violate protocol, as the Empress may speak with her pet hounds\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will speak with you directly as well\", Egwene said, keeping her face impassive. \"For the Amyrlin judges many trials. She must be able to speak to murderers and ra**sts in order to pass sentence upon them. I think you would be at home in their company, though I suspect they would find you nauseating\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see that this will be an uneasy alliance\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You expected otherwise?\" Egwene asked. \"You hold my sisters captive. What you have done to them is worse than murder. You have tortured them, broken their wills. I wish to the Light you had simply killed them instead\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would not expect you to understand what needs to be done\", Fortuona said, looking back toward the battlefield. \"You are marath\u0027damane. It is . . . natural for you to seek your own good, as you see it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natural indeed\", Egwene said softly. \"This is why I insist that you see me as I am, for I represent the ultimate proof that your society and empire are built upon falsehoods. Here I stand, a woman you insist should be collared for the common good. And yet I display none of the wild or dangerous tendencies that you claim I should have. So long as I am free from your collars, I prove to every man and woman who draws breath that you are a liar\". The other Seanchan murmured. Fortuona herself maintained a cool face. \"You would be much happier with us\", Fortuna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, would I?\" Egwene said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You speak of hating the collar, but if you were to wear it and see, you would find it a more peaceful life. We do not torture our damane. We care for them, and allow them to live lives of privilege\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don’t know, do you?\" Egwene asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the Empress\", Fortuona said. \"My domination extends across seas, and the realms of my protection encompass all that humankind knows and thinks. If there are things I do not know, they are known by those in my Empire, for I am the Empire\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delightful\", Egwene said. \"And does your Empire realize that I wore one of your collars? That I was once trained by your suldam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona stiffened, then rewarded Egwene with a look of shock, although she covered it immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in Falme\", Egwene said. \"A damane, trained by Renna. Yes, I wore your collar, woman. I found no peace there. I found pain, humiliation, and terror\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did I not know of this?\" Fortuona asked loudly, turning. \"Why did you not tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene glanced at the collected Seanchan nobility. Fortuona seemed to be addressing one man in particular, a man in rich black and golden clothing, trimmed with white lace. He had an eyepatch over one eye, black to match, and the fingernails on both hands were lacquered to a dark—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat?\" Egwene sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a kind of half-wave, looking embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Light, she thought. What has he thrown himself into? She galloped through plans in her mind. Mat was imitating a Seanchan nobleman. They must not know who he really was. Could she trade something to save him? \"Approach\", Fortuona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This man is not—\" Egwene began, but Fortuona spoke over her. \"Knotai\", she said, \"did you know that this woman was an escaped damane? You knew her as a child, I believe\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know who he is?\" Egwene asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do\", Fortuona said. \"He is named Knotai, but once was called Matrim Cauthon. Do not think he will serve you, marath’damane, though you did grow up together. He is the Prince of the Ravens now, a position he earned by his marriage to me. He serves the Seanchan, the Crystal Throne, and the Empress\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May she live forever\", Mat noted. \"Hello, Egwene. Glad to hear you escaped those Sharans. How’s the White Tower? Still . . . white, I guess?\" Egwene looked from Mat to the Seanchan Empress, then back at him again. Finally, unable to do anything else, she burst out laughing. \"You married Matrim Cauthon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The omens predicted it\", Fortuona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let yourself draw too close to a ta’veren\", Egwene said, \"and so the Pattern bound you to him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foolish superstitions\", Fortuona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene glanced at Mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being ta’veren never did get me much\", Mat said sourly. \"I suppose I should be grateful the Pattern didn’t haul me by my boots over to Shayol Ghul. Small blessing, that\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn’t answer my question, Knotai\", Fortuona said. \"Did you know this woman was an escaped damane? If so, why didn’t you speak of it to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t think too much about it\", Mat said. \"She wasn’t one for very long, Tuon\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will speak of this on another occasion\", Fortuona said softly. \"It will not be pleasant\". She turned back to Egwene. \"To converse with a former damane is not the same as speaking to one recently captured, or one who has always been free. News of this event will spread. You have caused me . . . inconvenience\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene regarded the woman, baffled. Light! These people were completely insane. \"What was your purpose insisting upon this meeting? The Dragon Reborn says you will help our fight. Help us, then\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to meet you\", Fortuona said. \"You are my opposite. I have agreed to join this peace the Dragon offered, but there are conditions\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Light, Rand, Egwene thought.
