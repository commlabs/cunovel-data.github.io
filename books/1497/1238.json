The powerful pressure formed at that moment not directly shook Lei zun-zhe trio until they took two continuous steps back but the faces of those Wind Lightning Pavilion experts around them also became ghastly pale. Even their breathing had become heavy. Their eyes were also covered with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majestic aura that suddenly erupted also stirred an uproar around the place. Everyone were stunned as they looked at Little Fairy Doctor’s three people group, which was standing behind Xiao Yan. At this moment, they finally discovered that the three people, who kept an unusually low profile while quietly standing behind Xiao Yan, were actually also genuine Dou Zun class experts!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, if one included Xiao Yan himself, four elite Dou Zuns would have appeared on the Falling Star Pavilion’s side. This kind of lineup was far from what the Wind Lightning Pavilion could compare with!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLei zun-zhe’s body quickly paused after having taken two steps back. His eyes contained a shocked expression as he looked at the three people behind Xiao Yan. Other than that unfamiliar looking strong man, he discovered that the beautiful young lady and the old man beside her had actually reached the peak of the three star Dou Zun class. Such strength was definitely not any weaker than him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible? Since when did the Falling Star Pavilion possess so many elite Dou Zuns?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great storm brewed within Lei zun-zhe’s heart. Most of those which could become a renown faction in the Central Plains did indeed possess some hidden foundation. However, it had also been some centuries since his Wind Lightning Pavilion had been founded. If one was to count, its history was even longer than that of the Falling Star Pavilion. Yet, the foundation to take out three Dou Zun class expert off-hand was a little overly rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two beast robe old men beside Lei zun-zhe also had a slight change in expression at this moment. Finally, they began to felt that things were troublesome. Four Dou Zuns. Even if one sum up the peak experts from both their clans, it was likely that they would not make such a figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the pressure of this vast and mighty aura, the atmosphere on the mountain top had also become a lot more constrained. The Wind Lightning Pavilion disciples, who were still proud earlier, were looking at each other at this moment. They did not dare to make any unusual movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This friend…” That old man in tiger robes widened his mouth. He wanted to say something but could only wisely keep his mouth shut after seeing Xiao Yan’s icy cold face. He turned his head and looked at the increasingly gloomy looking Lei zun-zhe beside him. In this current situation, it was obvious that the Wind Lightning Pavilion was at a disadvantage. It would be fine if they leave as soon as possible. Should a battle end up occurring and they were forcefully thrown out, they would only end up losing even more face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLei zun-zhe’s expression was as deep as water. His eyes were staring intently at Xiao Yan. A moment later, he finally clenched his teeth and said, “Great brat. If I knew this back then, I would have personally killed you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled slightly, ignoring this kind of hindsight that had occurred many years later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat smile of Xiao Yan caused Lei zun-zhe’s heart to erupt into an endless fury after the latter saw it. However, in this current situation, he also understood that with the strength of Xiao Yan’s group, it was sufficient to forcefully throw them down the mountain. A hero did not seek to suffer an obvious loss. The experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe had yet to arrive. At that time, there would naturally be the opportunity for this little bastard to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLei zun-zhe waved his hand after forcefully suppressing the fury in his heart. After which, he walked towards the mountain road that led to the foot of the mountain with a gloomy expression. The many Wind Lightning Cloud disciples behind him also kept their tents in a depressed manner before following him like dogs that had lost their homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, it is too early for you to be happy. This venerable self will come and seek payment for the trouble today!” Lei zun-zhe paused and spoke in a dense low voice when he was passing by Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will await you anytime.” Xiao Yan smiled and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Humph!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLei zun-zhe’s face twitched upon seeing this situation. He suddenly waved his sleeve and led the entire group away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cheer immediately erupted amongst the disciples of the Falling Star Pavilion as they watched the miserable looking Wind Lightning Pavilion disciples withdrawing from this place. Their eyes contained some additional respect when they looked at Xiao Yan. When their pride were stepped on by others, Xiao Yan had led them to regain their pride. At this moment, these disciples felt for the first time that the Falling Star Pavilion might become increasingly strong if they had such a junior pavilion chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMu Qing Luan, whose emotions had been tensed, also quietly sighed in relief. She secretly glanced at Xiao Yan by the side. This fellow was not even the least bit afraid even when faced an expert renown in the Central Plains like Lei zun-zhe. This point was completely different from a couple of years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Set up the tents first.” Xiao Yan smilingly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orders of Xiao Yan at this moment undoubtedly had some weight within the hearts of the Falling Star Pavilion’s disciples. Hence, all the disciples from the Falling Star Pavilion responded in usion after hearing him speak. They immediately scattered and once again set up the tents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that this fight for a campsite on this mountain top was finally over, those human figures in the surrounding sky finally shook their heads while not feeling satisfied. After which, they scattered. The big battle that they had anticipated the most did not erupt. This caused them to feel a little depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, although we have frightened off the Wind Lightning Pavilion today, they will definitely be unwilling to crush their teeth and swallow them. Therefore, you should be careful.” Mu Qing Luan reminded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He said, “Our main aim is the Soul Baby Fruit. No matter what happens, we must obtain this thing. If the Wind Lightning Pavilion really wished to intervene, they should not blame us for being ruthless…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMu Qing Luan nodded slowly as she looked at the chillness flickering on the young face. She said, “I am not worried about the Wind Lightning Pavilion. This place is after all the Beast Region. The Wind Lightning Pavilion has a good relationship with the Heaven Demon Phoenix. If they were to intervene at that time…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will deal with the situation accordingly when trouble arise. Even if today’s event did not occur, the Heaven Demon Phoenix will still attack if they view me as an eyesore.” Xiao Yan smiled randomly. He slowly walked to the edge of the mountain top. His eyes were narrowed as he looked at the middle of the mountain range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That direction is the place where the ancient remains has appeared this time around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan nodded slightly. He could sense that there was some distorted arc in that space. Clearly, the owner had placed an extremely powerful barrier on the ancient remains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are many dangers within this ancient remains. Quite a number of extremely powerful ancient puppets guards that place. Additionally, there are also some strange traps. Even an elite Dou Zun will not dare to be careless…” Elder Hu, who was behind Xiao Yan,spoke respectfully, “The ancient remains is hidden within a spatial seal. Every once in awhile, some crack lines will appear on the spatial ripple. Quite a number of powerful people has barge in during this period of time. However, most of them ended up escaping miserably from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Xiao Yan raised his eyebrows. It seemed that this ancient remains must still not be underestimated despite it having experienced such a great amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, no elite Dou Zuns has entered it up till now. This spatial seal possessed a restriction ability. If an elite Dou Zun tries to forcefully enter, it will trigger an extremely powerful seal backlash. A seal that is placed by an elite Dou Sheng is not something that an ordinary Dou Zun would dare to test with his body despite the seal having experienced countless amount of time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No Dou Zuns has entered?” Xiao Yan frowned immediately when he heard this. Did that not mean that he was also unable to enter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, junior chief need not be worried. This seal is already extremely thin. At the very most, the seal will gradually scatter after a few more days. Without the defence of the seal, elites Dou Zuns will also be able to safely enter it. Currently, there are quite a number of elite Dou Zuns around the ancient remains who are waiting for this moment.” Elder Hu fondled his beard and smilingly explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan sighed in relief only after hearing this. His eyes swept over the surrounding lush green mountains. With his sharp Spiritual Perception, he could indeed sense some extremely vague majestic aura. A surprise involuntarily flashed across his eyes at this moment. It was indeed worthy of being an ancient remains. This many elite Dou Zuns were actually attracted by it. It appeared that a bloody fight would be unavoidable in this remains battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you discover anyone from the Hall of Souls?” A thought suddenly passed through Xiao Yan’s heart as he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElder Hu frowned slightly upon hearing this. He voiced his thoughts, “I have not seen them until now. However, those fellows are usually strange and unpredictable. Even if they have come, it is likely that the two of us will not be able to discover them. However, based on the guess of the old me, the rumours about this ancient remains is spread quite widely. The Hall of Soul will likely also intervene. However, we do not know just how many experts has come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled slightly and nodded. A chillness flashed across his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ones whom you need to be worried about in this Bone Mountain Range is not the Hall of Soul. Being the owners of this place, the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python are the most troublesome to deal with. Not only did these fellows possess a large number but there are many experts amongst them. Even the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe is unwilling to exchange blows with them. However, I feel that things are a little strange. This place can be considered the territory of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. Given their character, they actually did not choose to seal off the mountain range. Instead, they had allowed this news to spread…” Mu Qing Luan softly spoke in a somewhat doubtful manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nine Serene Deep Ground Python…” Xiao Yan muttered to himself. He also nodded slightly. By being able to become one of the three great tribes of the Magical Beast world, this Nine Serene Deep Ground Python was definitely not an ordinary faction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, currently, the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe is unable to even take care of themselves. Where would they find the effort to come and manage this ancient remains…” Elder Hu shook his head and laughed when he heard this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unable to take care of themselves? What has happened?” Mu Qing Luan asked in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am also not certain about this. However, from the information that we have inquired, some of the experts from the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe has disappeared in a baffling manner recently. An elite Dou Zun from the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe is included amongst these missing experts. Currently, they are crazily searching for the murderer. Hee hee, the thing that is really unbelievable is that the one who has attacked the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe is actually alone…” Elder Hu fondled his beard and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expressions of Xiao Yan and Mu Qing Luan were that of being shocked upon hearing these words. Just who was this strong person who actually dared attack the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1237\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1239\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1238","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
