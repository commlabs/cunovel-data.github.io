The tender muscles inside me clenched down so hard that his next thrust caused him to groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I pled again, trembling with the effort to stave off my building cl**ax. \"I\u0027m going to come if you don\u0027t slow down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze was hot on my face, his h*ps still lunging in a measured tempo that was slowly stealing my sanity. \"Don\u0027t you want to come, Eva?\" he purred in that voice that could lure me into hell with a dreamy smile. \"Isn\u0027t that what you\u0027ve been working toward all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy neck arched as his lips drifted across my throat. \"Only when you say I can,\" I gasped. \"Only...when you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angel.\" One hand moved to my face, brushing back the strands of hair that clung to the perspiration on my skin. He kissed me deeply, reverently, licking deep into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come for me,\" he coaxed, quickening his pace. \"Come, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn command, the orgasm struck me like a blow, shocking my system with an overload of sensation. Wave after wave of pulsing heat rolled through me, contracting my sex and tightening my core. I cried out, first with an inarticulate sound of agonized pleasure, then with his name. Chanting it over and over as he drove his beautiful c**k into me, prolonging my cl**ax, before pushing me into another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch me,\" he rasped, as I fell apart beneath him. \"Hold me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreed from his command to hold the pillow, I bound him to my sweat-slick body with arms and legs. He pounded deep and hard, driving strenuously toward his cl**ax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came with a growl, his head thrown back as he spurted into me for long minutes. I held him until our bodies cooled and our breathing evened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Gideon finally rolled off me, he didn\u0027t go far. He wrapped himself around my back and whispered, \"Sleep now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t remember if I stayed awake long enough to reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday mornings could be awesome, when they began with Gideon Cross. We rode to work with my back propped against his side and his arm slung over my shoulder so that his fingers could link with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he toyed with the ring he\u0027d given me, I kicked out my legs and eyed the classic nude heels he\u0027d bought me along with some outfits to wear on the occasions I slept over. To start out the new week, I\u0027d decided on a black pinstriped sheath dress with a thin blue belt that reminded me of his eyes. He had excellent taste; I had to give him that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless he was sending one of his brunette \"acquaintances\" out on buying sprees...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the unpleasant thought aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d checked out the drawers he had set aside for me in his bathroom, I found all of my usual cosmetics and toiletries in all my usual shades. I didn\u0027t bother to ask how he knew, which might\u0027ve led to me freaking out. Instead, I chose to look at it as more proof of his attentiveness. He thought of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highlight of my morning had been helping Gideon dress in one of his seriously sexy suits. I\u0027d buttoned his shirt; he\u0027d tucked it into his pants. I\u0027d fastened his fly; he had knotted his tie. He\u0027d shrugged into his vest; I\u0027d smoothed the finely tailored material over his equally fine shirt, amazed to find that it could be just as sexy putting clothes on him as it was to take them off. It was like wrapping my own gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world would see the beauty of the packaging, but only I knew the man inside it and how precious he was. His intimate smiles and his deep husky laugh, the gentleness of his touch and the ferocity of his passion were all reserved for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bentley bounced lightly over a pothole in the road and Gideon tightened his hold. \"What\u0027s the plan after work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get to start my Krav Maga classes today.\" I couldn\u0027t keep the excitement out of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that\u0027s right.\" His lips brushed over my temple. \"You know I\u0027m going to have to watch you go through drills. Just thinking about it makes me hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t we already establish that everything makes you hard?\" I teased, nudging him with my elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything about you. Which is lucky for us, since you\u0027re insatiable. Text me when you\u0027re done and I\u0027ll meet you at your place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigging in my purse, I pulled out my smartphone to see if it still had a charge and saw a message from Cary. I opened it and found a video plus a text; Does X know his bro is a douche? Stay away from CV, baby girl *smooches*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started the playback but it took me a minute to figure out what I was seeing. When comprehension set in, I froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Gideon asked with his lips in my hair. Then he stiffened behind me, which told me he was looking over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary had filmed the video at the Vidal\u0027s garden party. From the eight-foot-high hedges in the background, he was in the maze, and from the leaves framing the screen, he was in hiding. The star of the show was a couple locked in a passionate embrace. The woman was beautifully teary, while the man kissed over her frantic words and soothed her with gentle strokes of his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were talking about me and Gideon, talking about how I was using my body to get my hands on his millions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Christopher crooned to a distraught Magdalene. \"You know Gideon gets bored fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s different with her. I - I think he loves her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her forehead. \"She\u0027s not his type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fingers I had linked with Gideon\u0027s tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we watched, Magdalene\u0027s demeanor slowly changed. She began to nuzzle into Christopher\u0027s touch, her voice softening, her mouth seeking. To an observer, it was clear he knew her body well - where to pet and where to rub. When she responded to his skilled seduction, he lifted her dress and f**ked her. That he was taking advantage of her was obvious. It was there in the contemptuously triumphant look on his face as he screwed her until she was limp. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-77.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
