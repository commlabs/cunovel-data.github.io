Back in the Roaring Twenties, a speakeasy might have hid behind a door like that. Here in the twenty-first century he knew nothing so innocuous awaited him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week had passed since Romy Cadman had barreled into his life. She\u0027d called him this afternoon, suggesting they meet in the city for a late dinner, and then she wanted to show him a few sights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had an excellent meal in the Flatiron district, with perhaps a little too much wine, and Patrick found himself feeling more than a little amorous. Butamour did not appear to be on the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real shame, because Romy Cadman was without a doubt the most exciting, most fascinating woman he had ever met. Being in her company reduced all the other women he\u0027d known in his life to wraiths. But he couldn\u0027t get past the firewall she\u0027d set up along her perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came close, though. At one point during dinner the conversation had strayed from sims and legal matters to the theater; somehow the subject of ballet came up, and Patrick had seen a change in Romy as she enthused over an upcoming production ofSwan Lake . She smiled and her eyes sparkled as she went on about her favorite dancers and performances. Patrick wished he\u0027d known more about the subject, but ballet had always left him cold. He did a good job of looking interested, though. Hell, he\u0027d try toe dancing himself if it would keep this woman\u0027s guard down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut too soon the subject ran out of steam and her defenses were back in place. She wasn\u0027t playing hard to get, shewas hard to get. At least where he was concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dessert, as he\u0027d helped her into her long black leather coat, he said, \"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027d wear something like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cleathre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is cleathre?\" Cloned leather. He\u0027d heard of it but had never actually seen it. He fingered the smooth, supple surface. \"Feels like the real thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Itis the real thing. It\u0027s just that no animals had to die to make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleathre and furc, cloned from skin cells of cows, minks, sables, even pandas, were the hottest new thing in the fashion industry. Ethically pure, esthetically perfect, and not cheap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the restaurant she\u0027d cabbed him down to this crummy ill-lit neighborhood in the West Teens, so far west he could smell the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt like a fish out of water: overdressed and under-leathered. Romy\u0027s coat matched the dominant color of the passing locals, but Patrick\u0027s white shirt, paisley tie, and herringbone overcoat made him stand out like a Klansman at an NAACP meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to worry about,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy for you to say. You\u0027re staying out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around uneasily. He was no country boy, knew Manhattan pretty well, in fact; but this was a part of the city he tended to avoid. Clubs down here were in the news too often, usually connected to stories about shootings and drug overdoses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy\u0027s smile had a bitter twist. \"I\u0027d go in with you, but it\u0027s not exactly my kind of place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep saying that, but it doesn\u0027t help me. Before I walk in there I\u0027d much rather know whose kind of place itis than whose kind it isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to find out for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then, why don\u0027t I find out in the daytime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the action at a place like this doesn\u0027t get rolling until about now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all because I said I thought sims had a pretty cushy existence, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop stalling,\" she said, giving him a gentle punch on the shoulder. \"Are you going to knock on that door or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick tried a grin. \"I\u0027d love to, except that it means leaving you out here alone on these mean streets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I can take care of myself,\" she said, and this time her smile had a touch of warmth in it. She pulled a finger-length vial from her pocket. \"One spray of this will stop a horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a rite of passage, a trial by fire? Was this what he had to do to win her? Or at the very least, earn the right to try? He glanced at her intent dark eyes under those perfect brows. If so...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said. \"Here I go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked the dozen or so paces to the door, took a deep breath of urinetinged air, and rapped on its battered, flaking surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA narrow window slid open and two dark eyes peered out at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" said a harsh voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling as if he\u0027d stepped into a particularly corny episode of the oldUntouchables , he said, \"I\u0027d, um, like to come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever been here before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, um, a bartender at the Tunnel sent me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tim. He told me to tell you that Tim sent me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Patrick had never met Tim, but Romy had told him to say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. Fighting the urge to turn and trot back down the alley, he stepped inside. The door slammed shut behind him and Patrick found himself sharing a long narrow hallway with a two-legged slab of beef who probably held graduate degrees in bar bouncing: shaved head, earrings, crooked nose, and a steroidal body stuffed into a sleeveless black T-shirt emblazoned withMOTHER \u0027S. An old Guns n\u0027 Roses tune vibrated from the end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slab held out his hand. \"Twenty-five bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Door charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-five bucks just to walk in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see busloads of gooks marchin through here? This ain\u0027t no sightseein stop. Pay up or walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick reached into his pocket. \"Tim didn\u0027t say anything about a door charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not supposed to.\" The bouncer grinned and stuck out his tongue - long and forked - and waggled it in Patrick\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA splicer, Patrick thought, trying to hide his revulsion. What the hell has Romy got me into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick handed him the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to the Jungle.\" The bouncer pointed toward the end of the hall. \"Mona will take care of you,\" he said, then cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, \"Incoming! Newbie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick hurried down the hallway, brushing the sides in his haste. The faster he went, the sooner this would be over. He hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona - at least he assumed the obese woman in the tight red dress exposing acres of cleavage was Mona - met him at the end of the hall. Another splicer: oversized lizard scales ran up the sides of her face and across her throat and who knew where else. She and the bouncer must be a couple - both into reptiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTattoos and piercings had once been considered avant garde, but eventually were mainstreamed. Then tailored genes and nonhuman splices hit the black market and the bod-mod crowd jumped on them like cats on a nipcoated mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, honey,\" she said, showing pointed teeth in a big welcoming grin. \"First time, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst time forwhat ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody\u0027s a little nervous the first time.\" She took his arm and led him around a corner. \"Let me introduce you to the girls first, then you take your time and pick the one you want. The base charge is two-fifty and that allows you half an hour. We charge extra if you go over, and of course there\u0027s surcharges for any specialties you want...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick stopped cold when he saw them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinda gets you, don\u0027t it,\" Mona said. \"Nobody ever imagines they could look this good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"girls\" were female sims, but nothing like Patrick had ever seen or imagined. Someone had caked them with makeup, either styled and dyed their hair or fitted them with wigs, then dressed them in vinyl or studded leather or lingerie - satin teddies, frilly see-through nighties, the whole Frederick\u0027s of Hollywood catalog. And their legs - most of them had shaved legs. Sims as a rule were only slightly hairier than humans, and the hair was coarser, but they didn\u0027t shave their legs or underarms. Patrick had never seen a shaved female sim, or ones with such breasts - they must have had implants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Christ!\" he blurted. \"What have you done to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did his best to hide his revulsion as Mona gave him a sharp look, but God it wasn\u0027t easy. Sim whores...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned again and gave him a knowing wink. \"You don\u0027t like them all dolled up? That\u0027s all right. I think I know your type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" That possibility was almost as unsettling as the sight of these sim sex slaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed to two unshaven, unenhanced females lounging nude on a couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got Teen and Mone over there. They work in our special jungle room for clients who like their sims just the way you\u0027d encounter them in the wild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the wild? They don\u0027toccur in the wild! They\u0027re...manufactured!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Mona said, her smile fading. \"Are you here to have fun or nitpick my ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick stared, he gawked, he gaped in shock at their surreal sicko getups. His stupefaction that anyone could find these pathetic creatures even remotely erotic quickly faded, replaced by a deeper revulsion as he noticed the bruises on their shaved limbs, their dead dull eyes. They looked like desiccated shells as they sat and smoked and stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoked...he\u0027d never known a sim to smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get out of here. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I think I\u0027ve changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" She looked genuinely offended. \"We got the best in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick started backing toward the hallway. \"I\u0027m sure you do, it\u0027s just that I...nothing personal, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ready yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring now, Mona said, \"Then why\u0027d you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend told me to.\" God, he wanted to kill Romy. \"Said I\u0027d find it enlightening. But I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and headed for the door where the bouncer waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerry!\" Mona called out behind him. \"Something\u0027s not right with this guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry placed himself between Patrick and the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a problem, pal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no, Patrick thought as his gut clenched. He\u0027s going to beat the shit out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Patrick said, pressing one hand against his stomach and the other over his mouth. \"I think I\u0027m going to be sick.\" He retched for effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you even fuckin dream of it, asshole! You puke in here, you\u0027re gonna clean it up - with your tongue!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick retched again, louder this time. \"Oh, God!\" He doubled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motherf - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the back of his coat bunch as Jerry grabbed a fistful of fabric, heard the door swing open, and then he was propelled into the stink of the alley. He stumbled, almost lost his footing, but managed to stay upright as he skidded to a halt against the brick wall on the far side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick didn\u0027t stop to look back. He pushed off the wall and hurried from the alley at something just short of a trot. He found Romy waiting for him on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" she said, raising her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Romy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d half expected some sort of ha-ha-the-joke\u0027s-on-you attitude, but she was all business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it you ran into a few sims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well I did!\" God, he was pissed. He felt besmirched, belittled, diminished. If she\u0027d been a guy he\u0027d be taking a poke at her right now. \"Why the hell - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up one hand to silence him and raised the other to her lips. He realized she was holding a PCA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My man inside confirms the sims are there. It\u0027s a go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a go?\" Patrick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A raid,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s get out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led him across the street. The first blue-and-white NYPD units were screeching to a halt in front of the alley by the time they reached the opposite curb. Patrick watched fascinated as a small horde of blue uniforms swarmed toward the dented door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick stared at Romy. \"You\u0027re a cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And this sort of work isn\u0027t really a kosher part of my OPRR duties, but I\u0027ve made it so. I snoop around. I talk to people, people talk to me. I\u0027ve been watching this place for some time. Took me a while to find the rear exit. Once I had that, I brought in NYPD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what did you need me for? Why\u0027d you send me in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze was focused on the alley, her dark eyes hard and bright as she watched the cops knock open the door with a short steel battering ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To make sure the sims were inside. You never know who\u0027s got a source in a precinct house. If they got wind of the raid they\u0027d have the sims stashed out of town and I\u0027d have egg on my face and the cops would be less cooperative next time I came to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she thought that was going to mollify him, she was dead wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have told me, damn it! Why\u0027d you send me in there with no idea what I\u0027d be getting into?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you have gone in if I had?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" He let the word trail off but knew the answer would have been a definite no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think so. But because you did, you played a meaningful part in reeling in some single-celled organisms posing as human beings,things \" - she managed to inject so much contempt into the word\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"who make pond scum look tasty.\" A wry smile. \"Ain\u0027t that cool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick had to admit it was, but he wasn\u0027t about to say so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The humans won\u0027t see daylight for a long, long time. Those sims in there have been either abducted or leased under false pretenses. The charges will range from grand theft to fraud to pandering to cruelty to animals to operating a criminal enterprise to promoting bestiality and whatever else the prosecutors can think of. You\u0027re the lawyer. You can imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick nodded, mentally adding a few more charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy kept talking. \"And the perps - do I sound like a cop? - are guaranteed to get slammed with max sentences. SimGen, as you\u0027ve learned firsthand, is relentless when it comes to anyone messing with their product. Their contacts in the judicial system, the ones who guarantee them favorable rulings whenever necessary, also see to it that anyone who transgresses against them lands lower-lip-deep in doo-doo. And after the criminal courts are through with the bastards, SimGen chases them down in civil court and gets dibs on everything they\u0027ve ever owned in their life and everything they\u0027ll earn till Resurrection Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that admiration I hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy shook her head. \"No. But you\u0027ve got to respect SimGen\u0027s efficiency. When their ends coincide with mine - as in rescuing sims from these oxygen wasters - I\u0027m only too happy to take advantage of that efficiency. But we part on thewhy : My reasons are personal and ethical, theirs are purely business and public relations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens to the sims?\" he said, remembering the tarted-up females.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone from SimGen will be by to pick up the poor things and take them to the Jersey campus where they\u0027ll rehab the ones they can and retire the ones they can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t exactly sound like the Evil Empire to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and glared at him. \"Oh, but they are, Patrick Sullivan. That sleazy little operation across the street couldn\u0027t have existed without SimGen, because SimGen made the sims that were mistreated in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Ford makes cars and some people get drunk and kill people with them or use them to rob banks or rig them with dynamite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"You don\u0027t see the difference between a hunk of tin and those creatures you\u0027re representing in court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do. I just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"SimGen created a new species and enslaved it. Sims feel pain, they feel pleasure, they laugh, theythink , damn it! And they\u0027re slaves. A sentient slave species...you don\u0027t think that\u0027s evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when you put it that way...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What other way is there to put it? They\u0027ve got to be stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick laughed. \"And who\u0027s going to do that? You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t believe this. She actually seemed serious. \"You don\u0027t really think - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s rotten in SimGen,\" she said. \"They\u0027re dirty. When I was there I could smell it. And when I find out what they\u0027re hiding, I\u0027m going to bring them down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her jaw. \"Me...with a little help from some friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just...friends.\" She stepped off the curb. \"I\u0027m going in to check over those sims, catalogue any injuries or evidence of drugging before the SimGen folks arrive. Want to come along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick hesitated. He\u0027d already been inside once and wasn\u0027t keen on going back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know...I\u0027ve got an early day tomorrow...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Beacon Ridge has filed some new motions on the federal appeal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gave him a mild jolt. \"You\u0027re really staying on top of this, aren\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tend to keep a close eye on my investments. As a matter of fact, I was planning on coming up to White Plains tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see you in action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes. Your investment.\" He wasn\u0027t sure if he liked the idea. He wasn\u0027t some trick pony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hang around awhile you could give me a ride up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowhere was an interesting development. \"Where are you staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know yet. How\u0027s your motel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa! His heart did a pole vault. \"Not fancy, but decent. As a matter of fact, you could save yourself a few bucks and stay in my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed from deep in her throat. God, what a sound. He could listen to her laugh all night. Visions of that marvelous tight body began to play in his head...in bed next to him, straddling him...Pamela had been gone for too long and right now every Y-chromosome in his body was doing a mating dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his hands. \"Nothing salacious here. The room\u0027s got two double beds. You could have the other one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How generous,\" she said with a wry twist to her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And listen, I\u0027ll be a Boy Scout. Really. You can have your bed, I\u0027ll have mine, and we\u0027ll turn the lights out and just lie there and talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick didn\u0027t quite believe he\u0027d just said that, but it was true. He\u0027d settle for talk, anything to stay close to this woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate the offer,\" Romy said, \"but I\u0027m a private sort of person. But you will drive me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrive you...aw, lady, don\u0027t say things like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. We\u0027ll have to stop at my office to pick up my overnight bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on the way home, lady, I\u0027m going to do my absolute damnedest to convince you that two rooms is one too many. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-27.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
