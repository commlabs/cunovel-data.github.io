As usual, he didn\u0027t know the meaning of the word small, and she didn\u0027t think he\u0027d eaten cereal since they were kids. They weren\u0027t having cereal this morning, either. Bacon sizzled in one frying pan, there were scrambled eggs in another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of her head, Daisy sat at the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sis, you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better be,\" she muttered, \"or a lot of this is going to waste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shrugged as he expertly flipped one pancake after another. \"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you know that, and if we\u0027re going after Costain, well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t finish the sentence, but then, he didn\u0027t have to. If they were hunting Costain, they\u0027d need their strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Star Wars theme cut across the silence. With a shake of her head, Daisy reached for Alex\u0027s cell phone, which was sitting on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t answer it!\" Alex warned. \"It\u0027s either Mom or Dad. They\u0027ve been calling since daybreak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stared at the phone until it stopped ringing. \"We probably should have left a note. I wonder why they haven\u0027t called me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you checked your phone? Maybe it\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. I\u0027ll check it later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex handed Daisy a plate, then sat down across from her. \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve figured out what we\u0027re up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so. Still...\" Daisy picked up her fork. \"You don\u0027t think Dad will come here, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shrugged. \"I doubt it. You know how he is. He\u0027s always let us make our own choices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy nodded. Her parents had never tried to control the lives of their children. Noah and Irene had taught them right from wrong, then let them discover for themselves that there were rewards or consequences for every act and every decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate in silence for several minutes before Alex said, \"So, how do you want to play this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. I just know we need to find Erik before it\u0027s too late. He\u0027s hurting, Alex. He might be dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Daisy, he can\u0027t be dying. He\u0027s already dead. The only way to take a vampire out now is by lopping off their head. Or impaling them with a well-placed stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, maybe what\u0027s happening to him won\u0027t kill him, but he\u0027s in pain unlike anything you can imagine. I dreamed about him again last night, and it was awful. I could see him. He\u0027s in a dungeon, chained to a wall. He hasn\u0027t fed in days...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex blew out a sigh. \"You know they don\u0027t have to feed every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! I know what I\u0027m feeling, what I\u0027ve seen. We came here to help him, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex rolled his eyes. \"All right, all right.\" Taking up his cell phone, he turned it off and shoved it into his pocket. \"Let\u0027s get this show on the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding Erik\u0027s whereabouts proved to be much easier than Daisy had expected. She didn\u0027t need her compass, although it was open in her lap as she drove. All she had to do was concentrate on Erik. As if guided by an internal GPS, she knew which streets to take, where to turn, and where to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure he\u0027s in there?\" Alex asked as she parked the Lexus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, but she couldn\u0027t help frowning as she read the small hand-lettered sign above the door. LA MORTE ROUGE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like a nightclub or a fancy whorehouse,\" Alex remarked. \"Are you sure he\u0027s in trouble and not just...ah, scratching an itch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure,\" Daisy replied succinctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. So, where do we go from here? This is your party. You call the shots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy closed her eyes. She could sense Erik\u0027s presence, but only faintly. At this time of the day, she figured he was resting. So, what now? Did they try to go in the front door, or find a back entrance? She glanced at the compass in her hand. The needle glowed red. If only it could tell her how many vampires were inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up and down the street. There was no one in sight. \"Let\u0027s see if we can find another entrance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy grimaced. That was a scary thought. Taking a deep breath, she got out of the car and walked around the corner of the building. The property in the rear of La Morte Rouge sloped downward. A narrow stone staircase led to a lower level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe breathed a sigh of relief when she reached the bottom of the stairs. The hill leveled out; the ground was mostly flat, dotted with weeds. There were no windows on the back side of the building. There was, however, a corroded iron door. It had a lock, but no handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on it.\" Pulling out his trusty lock pick, he set to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s taking so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get your panties in a twist. It\u0027s an old lock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy tapped her foot impatiently. If they couldn\u0027t get in this way, they\u0027d have to go through the front door. She frowned inwardly. Maybe the front door would have been the way to go. Maybe the lower floor was some kind of lair. For all they knew, Rhys could be inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to ask Alex if they were doing the right thing when he murmured, \"Bingo!\" He gave a little push on the door and it swung open with a rusty creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy took a few steps forward. She peered into the darkness beyond the doorway, wrinkled her nose against the musty smell emanating from the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smells like something died in there,\" Alex muttered as he pulled a flashlight from his pocket. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she hadn\u0027t been one hundred percent sure that Erik was in there somewhere and that he needed her, she never would have followed Alex into that foul-smelling cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor seemed to go on and on, with the smell of decomposing flesh growing increasingly odious until, abruptly, the corridor opened into a cavernous room that looked like something out of an old horror flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex swept his flashlight back and forth, revealing a dozen small animal cages along one wall, and six larger cells on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found the source of the horrible smell lying on its stomach a foot or so from the last cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik was in the last cell. He was sprawled on his back, his eyes closed, his arms shackled to the wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy gasped when the flashlight\u0027s beam settled on his face. His cheeks were sunken, his skin looked like old parchment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re too late,\" Alex whispered. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik? Erik, wake up!\" She moved closer to the cell, her hands curling around the bars. Was he breathing? He couldn\u0027t be dead! There was no stake in his heart; his head--she shuddered--was still attached to the rest of him. \"Erik, it\u0027s Daisy. Please wake up.\" She glanced over her shoulder, her unease at being in this horrible place growing by the minute. The sooner they got out of there, the better. \"Erik!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jackknifed into a sitting position, his movement so fast, so unexpected, she jumped backward, colliding with Alex, who had been standing behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing a hand to her heart, Daisy murmured, \"Thank the Lord!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\" She reached through the bars, wanting, needing, to touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shook his head. \"Get out of here,\" he said hoarsely. \"Now.\" He looked at Alex. \"Get her out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not leaving without you,\" Daisy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit! Rhys owns this club. He\u0027s probably upstairs right now. Get out of here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, the door, hurry.\" Daisy glanced over her shoulder, her memory of the last time they had encountered Rhys all too vivid in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the lock on the door to the dungeon, the lock on the cell door clicked open on the first try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik hissed as Alex stepped inside. \"Get out of here! Dammit, do you want to die? I haven\u0027t fed in weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex took a quick step backward, putting himself out of reach. \"All right, Daisy Mae, now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the pick,\" Daisy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way! Going in there is suicide. Look at his eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy took a deep breath as she plucked the lock pick from her brother\u0027s hand. \"He won\u0027t hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you willing to bet your life on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, because we don\u0027t have time to stand here arguing about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy, no!\" Erik scrambled to his feet. \"Get out!\" He closed his eyes as the hunger rose up within him, hot and heavy. \"Go. Please, Daisy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have to open his eyes to know she was standing beside him. Her scent teased his nostrils, the rapid beat of her heart was like thunder in his ears as she picked the lock on the silver shackles that bound him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the chains fell away, his arms closed around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stared up into his eyes, eyes burning with the need for blood. She took a deep breath. It wasn\u0027t wise to show fear in the face of a predator. \"Erik, just wait a few more minutes, until we\u0027re out of here, and then I\u0027ll give you what you need, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to concentrate on her words when her blood was singing so sweetly, promising an end to the pain knifing through him. She was here, warm in his arms. Her blood...he needed it as she needed air to breathe. The urge to bury his fangs in her throat grew stronger. He could take her, and her brother, too. It would be so easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik.\" She stroked his cheek with her fingertips. \"We need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the love shining brightly in the depths of her eyes and then, with a murmured curse, he released her and staggered out of the cell. \"We need to hurry,\" he said, his voice tight with pain. \"Rhys is coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering, \"I\u0027ve got a bad feeling about this,\" Alex grabbed Erik, slung him over his shoulder, and headed for the door with Daisy hot on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked against the sunlight when they emerged. \"Wait! The sun!\" Tugging off her sweater, she threw it over Erik\u0027s head. \"The door! Shouldn\u0027t we lock the door?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-39.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
