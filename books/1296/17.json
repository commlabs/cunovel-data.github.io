{"id":13770,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER VII THE MORATORIUM ON BRAINS","content":"\"Where have you been all this time?\" Eddie Willers asked the worker in the underground cafeteria, and added, with a smile that was an appeal, an apology and a confession of despair, \"Oh, I know it\u0027s I who\u0027ve stayed away from here for weeks.\" The smile looked like the effort of a crippled child groping for a gesture that he could not perform any longer. \"I did come here once, about two weeks ago, but you weren\u0027t here that night. I was afraid you\u0027d gone . . . so many people are vanishing without notice. I hear there\u0027s hundreds of them roving around the country. The police have been arresting them for leaving their jobs-they\u0027re called deserters-but there\u0027s too many of them and no food to feed them in jail, so nobody gives a damn any more, one way or another. I hear the deserters are just wandering about, doing odd jobs or worse-who\u0027s got any odd jobs to offer these days? . . . It\u0027s our best men that we\u0027re losing, the kind who\u0027ve been with the company for twenty years or more. Why did they have to chain them to their jobs? Those men never intended to quit-but now they\u0027re quitting at the slightest disagreement, just dropping their tools and walking off, any hour of the day or night, leaving us in all sorts of jams-the men who used to leap out of bed and come running if the railroad needed them. . . . You should see the kind of human driftwood we\u0027re getting to fill the vacancies. Some of them mean well, but they\u0027re scared of their own shadows. Others are the kind of scum I didn\u0027t think existed-they get the jobs and they know that we can\u0027t throw them out once they\u0027re in, so they make it clear that they don\u0027t intend to work for their pay and never did intend. They\u0027re the kind of men who like it-who like the way things are now. Can you imagine that there are human beings who like it? Well, there are. . . . You know, I don\u0027t think that I really believe it-all that\u0027s happening to us these days. It\u0027s happening all right, but I don\u0027t believe it. I keep thinking that insanity is a state where a person can\u0027t tell what\u0027s real.\u0026nbsp; “Well, what\u0027s real now is insane-and if I accepted it as real, I\u0027d have to lose my mind, wouldn\u0027t I? . . . I go on working and I keep telling myself that this is Taggart Transcontinental. I keep waiting for her to come back-for the door to open at any moment and-oh God, I\u0027m not supposed to say that! . . . What? You knew it? You knew that she\u0027s gone? . . . They\u0027re keeping it secret. But I guess everybody knows it, only nobody is supposed to say it. They\u0027re telling people that she\u0027s away on a leave of absence. She\u0027s still listed as our Vice-President in Charge of Operation. I think Jim and I are the only ones who know that she has resigned for good. Jim is scared to death that his friends in Washington will take it out on him, if it becomes known that she\u0027s quit. It\u0027s supposed to be disastrous for public morale, if any prominent person quits, and Jim doesn\u0027t want them to know that he\u0027s got a deserter right in his own family. . . . But that\u0027s not all. Jim is scared that the stockholders, the employees and whoever we do business with, will lose the last of their confidence in Taggart Transcontinental if they learn that she\u0027s gone. Confidence! You\u0027d think that it wouldn\u0027t matter now, since there\u0027s nothing any of them can do about it. And yet, Jim knows that we have to preserve some semblance of the greatness that Taggart Transcontinental once stood for. And he knows that the last of it went with her. . . . No, they don\u0027t know where she is. . . . Yes, I do, but I won\u0027t tell them. I\u0027m the only one who knows. . . . Oh yes, they\u0027ve been trying to find out. They\u0027ve tried to pump me in every way they could think of, but it\u0027s no use.\u0026nbsp; “I won\u0027t tell anyone. . . . You should see the trained seal that we now have in her place-our new Operating Vice-President. Oh sure, we have one-that is, we have and we haven\u0027t. It\u0027s like everything they do today-it is and it ain\u0027t, at the same tune. His name is Clifton Locey-he\u0027s from Jim\u0027s personal staff-a bright, progressive young man of forty-seven and a friend of Jim\u0027s. He\u0027s only supposed to be pinch-hitting for her, but he sits in her office and we all know that that\u0027s the new Operating Vice-President. He gives the orders-that is, he sees to it that he\u0027s never caught actually giving an order. He works very hard at making sure that no decision can ever be pinned down on him, so that he won\u0027t be blamed for anything. You see, his purpose is not to operate a railroad, but to hold a job. He doesn\u0027t want to run trains-he wants to please Jim. He doesn\u0027t give a damn whether there\u0027s a single train moving or not, so long as he can make a good impression on Jim and on the boys in Washington. So far, Mr. Clifton Locey has managed to frame up two men: a young third assistant, for not relaying an order which Mr. Locey had never given-and the freight manager, for issuing an order which Mr. Locey did give, only the freight manager couldn\u0027t prove it. Both men were fired, officially, by ruling of the Unification Board. . . . When things go well-which is never longer than half an hour-Mr. Locey makes it a point to remind us that \u0027these are not the days of Miss Taggart.\u0027 At the first sign of trouble, he calls me into his office and asks me-casually, in the midst of the most irrelevant drivel-what Miss Taggart used to do in such an emergency. I tell him, whenever I can. I tell myself that it\u0027s Taggart Transcontinental, and . . . and there\u0027s thousands of lives on dozens of trains that hang on our decisions. Between emergencies, Mr. Locey goes out of his way to be rude to me-that\u0027s so I wouldn\u0027t think that he needs me. He\u0027s made it a point to change everything she used to do, in every respect that doesn\u0027t matter, but he\u0027s damn cautious not to change anything that matters. The only trouble is that he can\u0027t always tell which is which. . . . On his first day in her office, he told me that it wasn\u0027t a good idea to have a picture of Nat Taggart on the wall- \u0027Nat Taggart,\u0027 he said, \u0027belongs to a dark past, to the age of selfish greed, he is not exactly a symbol of our modern, progressive policies, so it could make a bad impression, people could identify me with him.\u0027 \u0027No, they couldn\u0027t,\u0027 I said-but I took the picture off his wall. . . . What?. . . No, she doesn\u0027t know any of it. I haven\u0027t communicated with her. Not once. She told me not to. . . . Last week, I almost quit. It was over Chick\u0027s Special. Mr. Chick Morrison of Washington, whoever the hell he is, has gone on a speaking tour of the whole country-to speak about the directive and build up the people\u0027s morale, as things are getting to be pretty wild everywhere. He demanded a special train, for himself and party-a sleeper, a parlor car and a diner with barroom and lounge. The Unification Board gave him permission to travel at a hundred miles an hour-by reason, the ruling said, of this being a non-profit journey. Well, so it is. It\u0027s just a journey to talk people into continuing to break their backs at making profits in order to support men who are superior by reason of not making any. Well, our trouble came when Mr. Chick Morrison demanded a Diesel engine for his train. We had none to give him. Every Diesel we own is out on the road, pulling the Comet and the transcontinental freights, and there wasn\u0027t a spare one anywhere on the system, except-well, that was an exception I wasn\u0027t going to mention to Mr. Clifton Locey.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Locey raised the roof, screaming that come hell or high water we couldn\u0027t refuse a demand of Mr. Chick Morrison. I don\u0027t know what damn fool finally told him about the extra Diesel that was kept at Winston, Colorado, at the mouth of the tunnel. You know the way our Diesels break down nowadays, they\u0027re all breathing their last-so you can understand why that extra Diesel had to be kept at the tunnel. I explained it to Mr. Locey, I threatened him, I pleaded, I told him that she had made it our strictest rule that Winston Station was never to be left without an extra Diesel. He told me to remember that he was not Miss Taggart-as if I could ever forget it!-and that the rule was nonsense, because nothing had happened all these years, so Winston could do without a Diesel for a couple of months, and he wasn\u0027t going to worry about some theoretical disaster in the future when we were up against the very real, practical, immediate disaster of getting Mr. Chick Morrison angry at us. Well, Chick\u0027s Special got the Diesel. The superintendent of the Colorado Division quit. Mr. Locey gave that job to a friend of his own. I wanted to quit. I had never wanted to so badly. But I didn\u0027t. . . . No, I haven\u0027t heard from her. I haven\u0027t heard a word since she left. Why do you keep questioning me about her? Forget it. She won\u0027t be back, . . . I don\u0027t know what it is that I\u0027m hoping for. Nothing, I guess. I just go day by day, and I try not to look ahead. At first, I hoped that somebody would save us. I thought maybe it would be Hank Rearden. But he gave in. I don\u0027t know what they did to him to make him sign, but I know that it must have been something terrible. Everybody thinks so. Everybody\u0027s whispering about it, wondering what sort of pressure was used on him. . . . No, nobody knows. He\u0027s made no public statements and he\u0027s refused to see anyone, . . . But, listen, I\u0027ll tell you something else that everybody\u0027s whispering about. Lean closer, will you?-I don\u0027t want to speak too loudly. They say that Orren Boyle seems to have known about that directive long ago, weeks or months in advance, because he had started, quietly and secretly, to reconstruct his furnaces for the production of Rearden Metal, in one of his lesser steel plants, an obscure little place way out on the coast of Maine, He was ready to start pouring the Metal the moment Rearden\u0027s extortion paper-I mean, Gift Certificate-was signed. But-listen-the night before they were to start, Boyle\u0027s men were heating the furnaces in that place on the coast, when they heard a voice, they didn\u0027t know whether it came from a plane or a radio or some sort of loud-speaker, but it was a man\u0027s voice and it said that he would give them ten minutes to get out of the place.\u0026nbsp; “They got out. They started going and they kept on going-because the man\u0027s voice had said that he was Ragnar Danneskjold. In the next half-hour, Boyle\u0027s mills were razed to the ground. Razed, wiped out, not a brick of them left standing. They say it was done by long-range naval guns, from somewhere way out on the Atlantic. Nobody saw Danneskjold\u0027s ship. . . . That\u0027s what people are whispering. The newspapers haven\u0027t printed a word about it. The boys in Washington say that it\u0027s only a rumor spread by panic-mongers. . . . I don\u0027t know whether the story is true. I think it is. I hope it is. . . . You know, when I was fifteen years old, I used to wonder how any man could become a criminal, I couldn\u0027t understand what would make it possible.\u0026nbsp; Now-now I\u0027m glad that Ragnar Danneskjold has blown up those mills. May God bless him and never let them find him, whatever and wherever he is! . . . Yes, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve come to feel. Well, how much do they think people can take? . . . It\u0027s not so bad for me in the daytime, because I can keep busy and not think, but it gets me at night. I can\u0027t sleep any more, I lie awake for hours. . . . Yes!-if you want to know it-yes, it\u0027s because I\u0027m worried about her! I\u0027m scared to death for her. Woodstock is just a miserable little hole of a place, miles away from everything, and the Taggart lodge is twenty miles farther, twenty miles of a twisting trail in a godforsaken forest. How do I know what might happen to her there, alone, and with the kind of gangs that are roving all through the country these nights-just through such desolate parts of the country as the Berkshires? . . . I know I shouldn\u0027t think about it. I know that she can take care of herself. Only I wish she\u0027d drop me a line. I wish I could go there. But she told me not to.\u0026nbsp; “I told her I\u0027d wait. . . . You know, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here tonight. It helps me-talking to you and . . . just seeing you here. You won\u0027t vanish, like all the others, will you? . . . What? Next week? . . . Oh, on your vacation. For how long? . . . How do you rate a whole month\u0027s vacation? . . . I wish I could do that, to take a month off at my own expense. But they wouldn\u0027t let me. . . . Really? I envy you. . . . I wouldn\u0027t have envied you a few years ago. But now-now I\u0027d like to get away. Now I envy you-if you\u0027ve been able to take a month off every summer for twelve years.\"\u0026nbsp; It was a dark road, but it led in a new direction. Rearden walked from his mills, not toward his house, but toward the city of Philadelphia.\u0026nbsp; It was a great distance to walk, but he had wanted to do it tonight, as he had done it every evening of the past week. He felt at peace in the empty darkness of the countryside, with nothing but the black shapes of trees around him, with no motion but that of his own body and of branches stirring in the wind, with no lights but the slow sparks of the fireflies flickering through the hedges. The two hours between mills and city were his span of rest.\u0026nbsp; He had moved out of his home to an apartment in Philadelphia. He had given no explanation to his mother and Philip, he had said nothing except that they could remain in the house if they wished and that Miss Ives would take care of their bills. He had asked them to tell Lillian, when she returned, that she was not to attempt to see him.\u0026nbsp; They had stared at him in terrified silence.\u0026nbsp; He had handed to his attorney a signed blank check and said, \"Get me a divorce. On any grounds and at any cost. I don\u0027t care what means you use, how many of their judges you purchase or whether you find it necessary to stage a frame-up of my wife. Do whatever you wish. But there is to be no alimony and no property settlement.\" The attorney had looked at him with the hint of a wise, sad smile, as if this were an event he had expected to happen long ago. He had answered, \"Okay, Hank. It can be done. But it will take some time.\" \"Make it as fast as you can.\"\u0026nbsp; No one had questioned him about his signature on the Gift Certificate. But he had noticed that the men at the mills looked at him with a kind of searching curiosity, almost as if they expected to find the scars of some physical torture on his body.\u0026nbsp; He felt nothing-nothing but the sense of an even, restful twilight, like a spread of slag over a molten metal, when it crusts and swallows the last brilliant spurt of the white glow within. He felt nothing at the thought of the looters who were now going to manufacture Rearden Metal. His desire to hold his right to it and proudly to be the only one to sell it, had been his form of respect for his fellow men, his belief that to trade with them was an act of honor. The belief, the respect and the desire were gone. He did not care what men made, what they sold, where they bought his Metal or whether any of them would know that it had been his. The human shapes moving past him in the streets of the city were physical objects without any meaning. The countryside -with the darkness washing away all traces of human activity, leaving only an untouched earth which he had once been able to handle-was real.\u0026nbsp; He carried a gun in his pocket, as advised by the policemen of the radio car that patrolled the roads; they had warned him that no road was safe after dark, these days. He felt, with a touch of mirthless amusement, that the gun had been needed at the mills, not in the peaceful safety of loneliness and night; what could some starving vagrant take from him, compared to what had been taken by men who claimed to be his protectors?\u0026nbsp; He walked with an effortless speed, feeling relaxed by a form of activity that was natural to him. This was his period of training for solitude, he thought; he had to learn to live without any awareness of people, the awareness that now paralyzed him with revulsion. He had once built his fortune, starting out with empty hands; now he had to rebuild his life, starting out with an empty spirit.\u0026nbsp; He would give himself a short span of time for the training, he thought, and then he would claim the one incomparable value still left to him, the one desire that had remained pure and whole: he would go to Dagny. Two commandments had grown in his mind; one was a duty, the other a passionate wish. The first was never to let her learn the reason of his surrender to the looters; the second was to say to her the words which he should have known at their first meeting and should have said on the gallery of Ellis Wyatt\u0027s house.\u0026nbsp; There was nothing but the strong summer starlight to guide him, as he walked, but he could distinguish the highway and the remnant of a stone fence ahead, at the corner of a country crossroad. The fence had nothing to protect any longer, only a spread of weeds, a willow tree bending over the road and, farther in the distance, the ruin of a farmhouse with the starlight showing through its roof.\u0026nbsp; He walked, thinking that even this sight still retained the power to be of value: it gave him the promise of a long stretch of space undisturbed by human intrusion.\u0026nbsp; The man who stepped suddenly out into the road must have come from behind the willow tree, but so swiftly that it seemed as if he had sprung up from the middle of the highway. Rearden\u0027s hand went to the gun in his pocket, but stopped: he knew-by the proud posture of the body standing in the open, by the straight line of the shoulders against the starlit sky-that the man was not a bandit. When he heard the voice, he knew that the man was not a beggar.\u0026nbsp; \"I should like to speak to you, Mr. Rearden.\"\u0026nbsp; The voice had the firmness, the clarity and the special courtesy peculiar to men who are accustomed to giving orders.\u0026nbsp; \"Go ahead,\" said Rearden, \"provided you don\u0027t intend to ask me for help or money.\"\u0026nbsp; The man\u0027s garments were rough, but efficiently trim. He wore dark trousers and a dark blue windbreaker closed tight at his throat, prolonging the lines of his long, slender figure. He wore a dark blue cap, and all that could be seen of him in the night were his hands, his face and a patch of gold-blond hair on his temple. The hands held no weapon, only a package wrapped in burlap, the size of a carton of cigarettes.\u0026nbsp; \"No, Mr. Rearden,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t intend to ask you for money, but to return it to you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"To return money?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What money?\"\u0026nbsp; \"A small refund on a very large debt.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Owed by you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No, not by me. It is only a token payment, but I want you to accept it as proof that if we live long enough, you and I, every dollar of that debt will be returned to you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What debt?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The money that was taken from you by force.\"\u0026nbsp; He extended the package to Rearden, flipping the burlap open.\u0026nbsp; Rearden saw the starlight run like fire along a mirror-smooth surface.\u0026nbsp; He knew, by its weight and texture, that what he held was a bar of solid gold.\u0026nbsp; He looked from the bar to the man\u0027s face, but the face seemed harder and less revealing than the surface of the metal.\u0026nbsp; \"Who are you?\" asked Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"The friend of the friendless.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did you come here to give this to me?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you mean that you had to stalk me at night, on a lonely road, in order, not to rob me, but to hand me a bar of gold?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"When robbery is done in open daylight by sanction of the law, as it is done today, then any act of honor or restitution has to be hidden underground.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What made you think that I\u0027d accept a gift of this kind?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It is not a gift, Mr. Rearden. It is your own money. But I have one favor to ask of you. It is a request, not a condition, because there can be no such thing as conditional property. The gold is yours, so you are free to use it as you please. But I risked my life to bring it to you tonight, so I am asking, as a favor, that you save it for the future or spend it on yourself. On nothing but your own comfort and pleasure. Do not give it away and, above all, do not put it into your business.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Because I don\u0027t want it to be of any benefit to anybody but you. Otherwise, I will have broken an oath taken long ago-as I am breaking every rule I had set for myself by speaking to you tonight.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What do you mean?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have been collecting this money for you for a long time. But I did not intend to see you or tell you about it or give it to you until much later.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then why did you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Because I couldn\u0027t stand it any longer.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Stand what?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I thought that I had seen everything one could see and that there was nothing I could not stand seeing. But when they took Rearden Metal away from you, it was too much, even for me. I know that you don\u0027t need this gold at present. What you need is the justice which it represents, and the knowledge that there are men who care for justice.\"\u0026nbsp; Struggling not to give in to an emotion which he felt rising through his bewilderment, past all his doubts, Rearden tried to study the man\u0027s face, searching for some clue to help him understand. But the face had no expression; it had not changed once while speaking; it looked as if the man had lost the capacity to feel long ago, and what remained of him were only features that seemed implacable and dead. With a shudder of astonishment, Rearden found himself thinking that it was not the face of a man, but of an avenging angel.\u0026nbsp; \"Why did you care?\" asked Rearden. \"What do I mean to you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Much more than you have reason to suspect. And I have a friend to whom you mean much more than you will ever learn. He would have given anything to stand by you today. But he can\u0027t come to you. So I came in his place.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What friend?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I prefer not to name him.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did you say that you\u0027ve spent a long time collecting this money for me?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have collected much more than this.\" He pointed at the gold. \"I am holding it in your name and I will turn it over to you when the time comes. This is only a sample, as proof that it does exist. And if you reach the day when you find yourself robbed of the last of your fortune, I want you to remember that you have a large bank account waiting for you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What account?\"\u0026nbsp; \"If you try to think of all the money that has been taken from you by force, you will know that your account represents a considerable sum.\"\u0026nbsp; \"How did you collect it? Where did this gold come from?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It was taken from those who robbed you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Taken by whom?\"\u0026nbsp; \"By me.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who are you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Ragnar Danneskjold.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden looked at him for a long, still moment, then let the gold fall out of his hands.\u0026nbsp; Danneskjold\u0027s eyes did not follow it to the ground, but remained fixed on Rearden with no change of expression. \"Would you rather I were a law-abiding citizen, Mr. Rearden? If so, which law should I abide by? Directive 10-289?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Ragnar Danneskjold . . .\" said Rearden, as if he were seeing the whole of the past decade, as if he were looking at the enormity of a crime spread through ten years and held within two words.\u0026nbsp; \"Look more carefully, Mr. Rearden. There are only two modes of living left to us today: to be a looter who robs disarmed victims or to be a victim who works for the benefit of his own despoilers. I did not choose to be either.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You chose to live by means of force, like the rest of them,\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes-openly. Honestly, if you will. I do not rob men who are tied and gagged, I do not demand that my victims help me, I do not tell them that I am acting for their own good. I stake my life in every encounter with men, and they have a chance to match their guns and their brains against mine in fair battle. Fair? It\u0027s I against the organized strength, the guns, the planes, the battleships of five continents. If it\u0027s a moral judgment that you wish to pronounce, Mr. Rearden, then who is the man of higher morality: I or Wesley Mouch?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have no answer to give you,\" said Rearden, his voice low.\u0026nbsp; \"Why should you be shocked, Mr. Rearden? I am merely complying with the system which my fellow men have established. If they believe that force is the proper means to deal with one another, I am giving them what they ask for. If they believe that the purpose of my life is to serve them, let them try to enforce their creed. If they believe that my mind is their property-let them come and get it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But what sort of life have you chosen? To what purpose are you giving your mind?\"\u0026nbsp; \"To the cause of my love.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Which is what?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Justice.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Served by being a pirate?\"\u0026nbsp; \"By working for the day when I won\u0027t have to be a pirate any longer.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Which day is that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The day when you\u0027ll be free to make a profit on Rearden Metal.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh God!\" said Rearden, laughing, his voice desperate. \"Is that your ambition?\"\u0026nbsp; Danneskjold\u0027s face did not change. \"It is.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you expect to live to see that day?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes. Don\u0027t you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then what are you looking forward to, Mr. Rearden?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Nothing.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What are you working for?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden glanced at him. \"Why do you ask that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"To make you understand why I\u0027m not.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t expect me ever to approve of a criminal.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t expect it. But there are a few things I want to help you to see.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Even if they\u0027re true, the things you said, why did you choose to be a bandit? Why didn\u0027t you simply step out, like-\" He stopped.\u0026nbsp; \"Like Ellis Wyatt, Mr. Rearden? Like Andrew Stockton? Like your friend Ken Danagger?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Would you approve of that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I-\" He stopped, shocked by his own words.\u0026nbsp; The shock that came next was to see Danneskjold smile: it was like seeing the first green of spring on the sculptured planes of an iceberg. Rearden realized suddenly, for the first time, that Danneskjold\u0027s face was more than handsome, that it had the startling beauty of physical perfection-the hard, proud features, the scornful mouth of a Viking\u0027s statue-yet he had not been aware of it, almost as if the dead sternness of the face had forbidden the impertinence of an appraisal.\u0026nbsp; But the smile was brilliantly alive.\u0026nbsp; \"I do approve of it, Mr. Rearden. But I\u0027ve chosen a special mission of my own. I\u0027m after a man whom I want to destroy. He died many centuries ago, but until the last trace of him is wiped out of men\u0027s minds, we will not have a decent world to live in.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What man?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Robin Hood.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden looked at him blankly, not understanding.\u0026nbsp; \"He was the man who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. Well, I\u0027m the man who robs the poor and gives to the rich-or, to be exact, the man who robs the thieving poor and gives back to the productive rich.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What in blazes do you mean?\"\u0026nbsp; \"If you remember the stories you\u0027ve read about me in the newspapers, before they stopped printing them, you know that I have never robbed a private ship and never taken any private property. Nor have I ever robbed a military vessel-because the purpose of a military fleet is to protect from violence the citizens who paid for it, which is the proper function of a government. But I have seized every loot carrier that came within range of my guns, every government relief ship, subsidy ship, loan ship, gift ship, every vessel with a cargo of goods taken by force from some men for the unpaid, unearned benefit of others. I seized the boats that sailed under the flag of the idea which I am fighting: the idea that need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrifices-that the need of some men is the knife of a guillotine hanging over others-that all of us must live with our work, our hopes, our plans, our efforts at the mercy of the moment when that knife will descend upon us-and that the extent of our ability is the extent of our danger, so that success will bring our heads down on the block, while failure will give us the right to pull the cord. This is the horror which Robin Hood immortalized as an ideal of righteousness. It is said that he fought against the looting rulers and returned the loot to those who had been robbed, but that is not the meaning of the legend which has survived. He is remembered, not as a champion of property, but as a champion of need, not as a defender of the robbed, but as a provider of the poor. He is held to be the first man who assumed a halo of virtue by practicing charity with wealth which he did not own, by giving away goods which he had not produced, by making others pay for the luxury of his pity. He is the man who became the symbol of the idea that need, not achievement, is the source of rights, that we don\u0027t have to produce, only to want, that the earned does not belong to us, but the unearned does. He became a justification for every mediocrity who, unable to make his own living, has demanded the power to dispose of the property of his betters, by proclaiming his willingness to devote his life to his inferiors at the price of robbing his superiors. It is this foulest of creatures-the double-parasite who lives on the sores, of the poor and the blood of the rich-whom men have come to regard as a moral ideal. And this has brought us to a world where the more a man produces, the closer he comes to the loss of all his rights, until, if his ability is great enough, he becomes a rightless creature delivered as prey to any claimant-while in order to be placed above rights, above principles, above morality, placed where anything is permitted to him, even plunder and murder, all a man has to do is to be in need. Do you wonder why the world is collapsing around us? That is what I am fighting, Mr. Rearden. Until men learn that of all human symbols, Robin Hood is the most immoral and the most contemptible, there will be no justice on earth and no way for mankind to survive.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden listened, feeling numb. But under the numbness, like the first thrust of a seed breaking through, he felt an emotion he could not identify except that it seemed familiar and very distant, like something experienced and renounced long ago.\u0026nbsp; \"What I actually am, Mr. Rearden, is a policeman. It is a policeman\u0027s duty to protect men from criminals-criminals being those who seize wealth by force. It is a policeman\u0027s duty to retrieve stolen property and return it to its owners. But when robbery becomes the purpose of the law, and the policeman\u0027s duty becomes, not the protection, but the plunder of property-then it is an outlaw who has to become a policeman. I have been selling the cargoes I retrieved to some special customers of mine in this country, who pay me in gold. Also, I have been selling my cargoes to the smugglers and the black-market traders of the People\u0027s States of Europe. Do you know the conditions of existence in those People\u0027s States? Since production and trade-not violence-were decreed to be crimes, the best men of Europe had no choice but to become criminals. The slave-drivers of those States are kept in power by the handouts from their fellow looters in countries not yet fully drained, such as this country. I do not let the handouts reach them. I sell the goods to Europe\u0027s law-breakers, at the highest prices I can get, and I make them pay me in gold. Gold is the objective value, the means of preserving one\u0027s wealth and one\u0027s future. Nobody is permitted to have gold in Europe, except the whip-wielding friends of humanity, who claim that they spend it for the welfare of their victims. That is the gold which my smuggler-customers obtain to pay me. How? By the same method I use to obtain the goods. And then I return the gold to those from whom the goods were stolen-to you, Mr. Rearden, and to other men like you.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden grasped the nature of the emotion he had forgotten. It was the emotion he had felt when, at the age of fourteen, he had looked at his first pay check-when, at the age of twenty-four, he had been made superintendent of the ore mines-when, as the owner of the mines, he had placed, in his own name, his first order for new equipment from the best concern of the time, Twentieth Century Motors-an emotion of solemn, joyous excitement, the sense of winning his place in a world he respected and earning the recognition of men he admired. For almost two decades, that emotion had been buried under a mount of wreckage, as the years had added layer upon gray layer of contempt, of indignation, of his struggle not to look around him, not to see those he dealt with, not to expect anything from men and to keep, as a private vision within the four walls of his office, the sense of that world into which he had hoped to rise. Yet there it was again, breaking through from under the wreckage, that feeling of quickened interest, of listening to the luminous voice of reason, with which one could communicate and deal and live. But it was the voice of a pirate speaking about acts of violence, offering him this substitute for his world of reason and justice. He could not accept it; he could not lose whatever remnant of his vision he still retained. He listened, wishing he could escape, yet knowing that he would not miss a word of it.\u0026nbsp; \"I deposit the gold in a bank-in a gold-standard bank, Mr. Rearden -to the account of men who are its rightful owners. They are the men of superlative ability who made their fortunes by personal effort, in free trade, using no compulsion, no help from the government. They are the great victims who have contributed the most and suffered the worst injustice in return. Their names are written in my book of restitution. Every load of gold which I bring back is divided among them and deposited to their accounts.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who are they?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re one of them, Mr. Rearden. I cannot compute all the money that has been extorted from you-in hidden taxes, in regulations, in wasted time, in lost effort, in energy spent to overcome artificial obstacles. I cannot compute the sum, but if you wish to see its magnitude -look around you. The extent of the misery now spreading through this once prosperous country is the extent of the injustice which you have suffered. If men refuse to pay the debt they owe you, this is the manner in which they will pay for it. But there is one part of the debt which is computed and on record. That is the part which I have made it my purpose to collect and return to you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What is that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Your income tax, Mr. Rearden.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Your income tax for the last twelve years.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You intend to refund that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"In full and in gold, Mr. Rearden.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden burst out laughing; he laughed like a young boy, in simple amusement, in enjoyment of the incredible. \"Good God! You\u0027re a policeman and a collector of Internal Revenue, too?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" said Danneskjold gravely.\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re not serious about this, are you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do I look as if I\u0027m joking?\"\u0026nbsp; \"But this is preposterous!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Any more preposterous than Directive 10-289?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s not real or possible!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Is only evil real and possible?\"\u0026nbsp; \"But-\"\u0026nbsp; \"Are you thinking that death and taxes are our only certainty, Mr. Rearden? Well, there\u0027s nothing I can do about the first, but if I lift the burden of the second, men might learn to see the connection between the two and what a longer, happier life they have the power to achieve. They might learn to hold, not death and taxes, but life and production as their two absolutes and as the base of their moral code.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden looked at him, not smiling. The tall, slim figure, with the windbreaker stressing its trained muscular agility, was that of a highwayman; the stern marble face was that of a judge; the dry, clear voice was that of an efficient bookkeeper.\u0026nbsp; \"The looters are not the only ones who have kept records on you, Mr. Rearden. So have I. I have, in my files, copies of all your income tax returns for the last twelve years, as well as the returns of all my other clients. I have friends in some astonishing places, who obtain the copies I need. I divide the money among my clients in proportion to the sums extorted from them. Most of my accounts have now been paid to their owners. Yours is the largest one left to settle. On the day when you will be ready to claim it-the day when I\u0027ll know that no penny of it will go back to support the looters-I will turn your account over to you. Until then-\" He glanced down at the gold on the ground. \"Pick it up, Mr. Rearden. It\u0027s not stolen. It\u0027s yours.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden would not move or answer or look down.\u0026nbsp; \"Much more than that lies in the bank, in your name.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What bank?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you remember Midas Mulligan of Chicago?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, of course.\"\u0026nbsp; \"All my accounts are deposited at the Mulligan Bank.\"\u0026nbsp; \"There is no Mulligan Bank in Chicago.\"\u0026nbsp; \"It is not in Chicago.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden let a moment pass. \"Where is it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I think that you will know it before long, Mr. Rearden. But I cannot tell you now.\" He added, \"I must tell you, however, that I am the only one responsible for this undertaking. It is my own personal mission. No one is involved in it but me and the men of my ship\u0027s crew. Even my banker has no part in it, except for keeping the money I deposit. Many of my friends do not approve of the course I\u0027ve chosen. But we all choose different ways to fight the same battle-and this is mine.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden smiled contemptuously, \"Aren\u0027t you one of those damn altruists who spends his time on a non-profit venture and risks his life merely to serve others?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No, Mr. Rearden. I am investing my time in my own future. When we are free and have to start rebuilding from out of the ruins, I want to see the world reborn as fast as possible. If there is, then, some working capital in the right hands-in the hands of our best, our most productive men-it will save years for the rest of us and, incidentally, centuries for the history of the country. Did you ask what you meant to me? Everything I admire, everything I want to be on the day when the earth will have a place for such state of being, everything I want to deal with-even if this is the only way I can deal with you and be of use to you at present.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\" whispered Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"Because my only love, the only value I care to live for, is that which has never been loved by the world, has never won recognition or friends or defenders: human ability. That is the love I am serving-and if I should lose my life, to what better purpose could I give it?\"\u0026nbsp; The man who had lost the capacity to feel?-thought Rearden, and knew that the austerity of the marble face was the form of a disciplined capacity to feel too deeply. The even voice was continuing dispassionately: \"I wanted you to know this. I wanted you to know it now, when it most seem to you that you\u0027re abandoned at the bottom of a pit among subhuman creatures who are all that\u0027s left of mankind. I wanted you to know, in your most hopeless hour, that the day of deliverance is much closer than you think. And there was one special reason why I had to speak to you and tell you my secret ahead of the proper time. Have you heard of what happened to Orren Boyle\u0027s steel mills on the coast of Maine?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" said Rearden-and was shocked to hear that the word came as a gasp out of the sudden jolt of eagerness within him. \"I didn\u0027t know whether it was true.\"\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s true. I did it. Mr. Boyle is not going to manufacture Rearden Metal on the coast of Maine. He is not going to manufacture it anywhere. Neither is any other looting louse who thinks that a directive can give him a right to your brain. Whoever attempts to produce that Metal, will find his furnaces blown up, his machinery blasted, his shipments wrecked, his plant set on fire-so many things will happen to any man who tries it, that people will say there\u0027s a curse on it, and there will soon be no worker in the country willing to enter the plant of any new producer of Rearden Metal. If men like Boyle think that force is all they need to rob their betters-let them see what happens when one of their betters chooses to resort to force. I wanted you to know, Mr. Rearden, that none of them will produce your Metal nor make a penny on it.\"\u0026nbsp; Because he felt an exultant desire to laugh-as he had laughed at the news of Wyatt\u0027s fire, as he had laughed at the crash of d\u0027Anconia Copper-and knew that if he did, the thing he feared would hold him, would not release him this time, and he would never see his mills again-Rearden drew back and, for a moment, kept his lips closed tight to utter no sound. When the moment was over, he said quietly, his voice firm and dead, \"Take that gold of yours and get away from here. I won\u0027t accept the help of a criminal.\"\u0026nbsp; Danneskjold\u0027s face showed no reaction. \"I cannot force you to accept the gold, Mr. Rearden. But I will not take it back. You may leave it lying where it is, if you wish.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t want your help and I don\u0027t intend to protect you. If I were within reach of a phone, I would call the police. I would and I will, if you ever attempt to approach me again. I\u0027ll do it-in self-protection.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I understand exactly what you mean.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You know-because I\u0027ve listened to you, because you\u0027ve seen me eager to hear it-that I haven\u0027t damned you as I should. I can\u0027t damn you or anyone else. There are no standards left for men to live by, so I don\u0027t care to judge anything they do today or in what manner they attempt to endure the unendurable. If this is your manner, I will let you go to hell in your own way, but I want no part of it. Neither as your inspiration nor as your accomplice. Don\u0027t expect me ever to accept your bank account, if it does exist. Spend it on some extra armor plate for yourself-because I\u0027m going to report this to the police and give them every clue I can to set them on your trail.\"\u0026nbsp; Danneskjold did not move or answer. A freight train was rolling by, somewhere in the distance and darkness; they could not see it, but they heard the pounding beat of wheels filling the silence, and it seemed close, as if a disembodied train, reduced to a long string of sound, were going past them in the night.\u0026nbsp; \"You wanted to help me in my most hopeless hour?\" said Rearden. \"If I am brought to where my only defender is a pirate, then I don\u0027t care to be defended any longer. You speak some remnant of a human language, so in the name of that, I\u0027ll tell you that I have no hope left, but I have the knowledge that when the end comes, I will have lived by my own standards, even while I was the only one to whom they remained valid. I will have lived in the world in which I started and I will go down with the last of it. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll want to understand me, but-\"\u0026nbsp; A beam of light hit them with the violence of a physical blow. The clangor of the train had swallowed the noise of the motor and they had not heard the approach of the car that swept out of the side road, from behind the farmhouse. They were not in the car\u0027s path, yet they heard the screech of brakes behind the two headlights, pulling an invisible shape to a stop. It was Rearden who jumped back involuntarily and had time to marvel at his companion: the swiftness of Danneskjold\u0027s self-control was that he did not move.\u0026nbsp; It was a police car and it stopped beside them.\u0026nbsp; The driver leaned out. \"Oh, it\u0027s you, Mr. Rearden!\" he said, touching his fingers to his cap. \"Good evening, sir.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Hello,\" said Rearden, fighting to control the unnatural abruptness of his voice.\u0026nbsp; There were two patrolmen in the front seat of the car and their faces had a tight look of purpose, not the look of their usual friendly intention to stop for a chat.\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. Rearden, did you walk from the mills by way of Edgewood Road, past Blacksmith Cove?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes. Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did you happen to see a man anywhere around these parts, a stranger moving along in a hurry?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Where?\"\u0026nbsp; \"He\u0027d be either on foot or in a battered wreck of a car that\u0027s got a million-dollar motor.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What man?\"\u0026nbsp; \"A tall man with blond hair.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who is he?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You wouldn\u0027t believe it if I told you, Mr. Rearden. Did you see him?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden was not aware of his own questions, only of the astonishing fact that he was able to force sounds past some beating barrier inside his throat. He was looking straight at the policeman, but he felt as if the focus of his eyes had switched to his side vision, and what he saw most clearly was Danneskjold\u0027s face watching him with no expression, with no line\u0027s, no muscle\u0027s worth of feeling. He saw Danneskjold\u0027s arms hanging idly by his sides, the hands relaxed, with no sign of intention to reach for a weapon, leaving the tall, straight body defenseless and open-open as to a firing squad. He saw, in the light, that the face looked younger than he had thought and that the eyes were sky-blue.\u0026nbsp; He felt that his one danger would be to glance directly at Danneskjold-and he kept his eyes on the policeman, on the brass buttons of a blue uniform, but the object filling his consciousness, more forcefully than a visual perception, was Danneskjold\u0027s body, the naked body under the clothes, the body that would be wiped out of existence. He did not hear his own words, because he kept hearing a single sentence in his mind, without context except the feeling that it was the only thing that mattered to him in the world: \"If I should lose my life, to what better purpose could I give it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did you see him, Mr. Rearden?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No,\" said Rearden. \"I didn\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; The policeman shrugged regretfully and closed his hands about the steering wheel. \"You didn\u0027t see any man that looked suspicious?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Nor any strange car passing you on the road?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; The policeman reached for the starter. \"They got word that he was seen ashore in these parts tonight, and they\u0027ve thrown a dragnet over five counties. We\u0027re not supposed to mention his name, not to scare the folks, but he\u0027s a man whose head is worth three million dollars in rewards from all over the world.\"\u0026nbsp; He had pressed the starter and the motor was churning the air with bright cracks of sound, when the second policeman leaned forward.\u0026nbsp; He had been looking at the blond hair under Danneskjold\u0027s cap.\u0026nbsp; \"Who is that, Mr. Rearden?\" he asked.\u0026nbsp; \"My new bodyguard,\" said Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"Oh . . . ! A sensible precaution, Mr. Rearden, in times like these. Good night, sir.\"\u0026nbsp; The motor jerked forward. The red taillights of the car went shrinking down the road. Danneskjold watched it go, then glanced pointedly at Rearden\u0027s right hand. Rearden realized that he had stood facing the policemen with his hand clutching the gun in his pocket and that he had been prepared to use it.\u0026nbsp; He opened his fingers and drew his hand out hastily. Danneskjold smiled. It was a smile of radiant amusement, the silent laughter of a clear, young spirit greeting a moment it was glad to have lived.\u0026nbsp; And although the two did not resemble each other, the smile made Rearden think of Francisco d\u0027Anconia.\u0026nbsp; \"You haven\u0027t told a lie,\" said Ragnar Danneskjold. \"Your bodyguard-that\u0027s what I am and what I\u0027ll deserve to be, in many more ways than you can know at present. Thanks, Mr. Rearden, and so long-we\u0027ll meet again much sooner than I had hoped.\"\u0026nbsp; He was gone before Rearden could answer. He vanished beyond the stone fence, as abruptly and soundlessly as he had come. When Rearden turned to look through the farm field, there was no trace of him and no sign of movement anywhere in the darkness.\u0026nbsp; Rearden stood on the edge of an empty road in a spread of loneliness vaster than it had seemed before. Then he saw, lying at his feet, an object wrapped in burlap, with one corner exposed and glistening in the moonlight, the color of the pirate\u0027s hair. He bent, picked it up and walked on.\u0026nbsp; Kip Chalmers swore as the train lurched and spilled his cocktail over the table top. He slumped forward, his elbow in the puddle, and said: \"God damn these railroads! What\u0027s the matter with their track?\u0026nbsp; You\u0027d think with all the money they\u0027ve got they\u0027d disgorge a little, so we wouldn\u0027t have to bump like farmers on a hay cart!\"\u0026nbsp; His three companions did not take the trouble to answer. It was late, and they remained in the lounge merely because an effort was needed to retire to their compartments. The lights of the lounge looked like feeble portholes in a fog of cigarette smoke dank with the odor of alcohol. It was a private car, which Chalmers had demanded and obtained for his journey; it was attached to the end of the Comet and it swung like the tail of a nervous animal as the Comet coiled through the curves of the mountains.\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m going to campaign for the nationalization of the railroads,\" said Kip Chalmers, glaring defiantly at a small, gray man who looked at him without interest. \u0027That\u0027s going to be my platform plank. I\u0027ve got to have a platform plank. I don\u0027t like Jim Taggart. He looks like a soft-boiled clam. To hell with the railroads! It\u0027s time we took them over.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Go to bed,\" said the man, \"if you expect to look like anything human at the big rally tomorrow.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you think we\u0027ll make it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ve got to make it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I know I\u0027ve got to. But I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll get there on time. This goddamn snail of a super-special is hours late.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ve got to get there, Kip,\" said the man ominously, in that stubborn monotone of the unthinking which asserts an end without concern for the means.\u0026nbsp; \"God damn you, don\u0027t you suppose I know it?\"\u0026nbsp; Kip Chalmers had curly blond hair and a shapeless mouth. He came from a semi-wealthy, semi-distinguished family, but he sneered at wealth and distinction in a manner which implied that only a top rank aristocrat could permit himself such a degree of cynical indifference. He had graduated from a college which specialized in breeding that kind of aristocracy. The college had taught him that the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are stupid enough to think. He had made his way in Washington with the grace of a cat-burglar, climbing from bureau to bureau as from ledge to ledge of a crumbling structure. He was ranked as semi-powerful, but his manner made laymen mistake him for nothing less than Wesley Mouch.\u0026nbsp; For reasons of his own particular strategy, Kip Chalmers had decided to enter popular politics and to run for election as Legislator from California, though he knew nothing about that state except the movie industry and the beach clubs. His campaign manager had done the preliminary work, and Chalmers was now on his way to face his future constituents for the first time at an over publicized rally in San Francisco tomorrow night. The manager had wanted him to start a day earlier, but Charmers had stayed in Washington to attend a cocktail party and had taken the last train possible. He had shown no concern about the rally until this evening, when he noticed that the Comet was running six hours late.\u0026nbsp; His three companions did not mind his mood: they liked his liquor. Lester Tuck, his campaign manager, was a small, aging man with a face that looked as if it had once been punched in and had never rebounded. He was an attorney who, some generations earlier, would have represented shoplifters and people who stage accidents on the premises of rich corporations; now he found that he could do better by representing men like Kip Chalmers.\u0026nbsp; Laura Bradford was Chalmers\u0027 current mistress; he liked her because his predecessor had been Wesley Mouch. She was a movie actress who had forced her way from competent featured player to incompetent star, not by means of sleeping with studio executives, but by taking the long-distance short cut of sleeping with bureaucrats. She talked economics, instead of glamor, for press interviews, in the belligerently righteous style of a third-rate tabloid; her economics consisted of the assertion that \"we\u0027ve got to help the poor.\"\u0026nbsp; Gilbert Keith-Worthing was Chalmers\u0027 guest, for no reason that either of them could discover. He was a British novelist of world fame, who had been popular thirty years ago; since then, nobody bothered to read what he wrote, but everybody accepted him as a walking classic.\u0026nbsp; He had been considered profound for uttering such things as: \"Freedom? Do let\u0027s stop talking about freedom. Freedom is impossible. Man can never be free of hunger, of cold, of disease, of physical accidents. He can never be free of the tyranny of nature. So why should he object to the tyranny of a political dictatorship?\" When all of Europe put into practice the ideas which he bad preached, he came to live in America. Through the years, his style of writing and his body had grown flabby. At seventy, he was an obese old man with retouched hair and a manner of scornful cynicism retouched by quotations from the yogis about the futility of all human endeavor. Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed to look distinguished. Gilbert Keith Worthing had come along, because he had no particular place to go.\u0026nbsp; \"God damn these railroad people!\" said Kip Chalmers. \"They\u0027re doing it on purpose. They want to ruin my campaign. I can\u0027t miss that rally! For Christ\u0027s sake, Lester, do something!\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ve tried,\" said Lester Tuck. At the train\u0027s last stop, he had tried, by long-distance telephone, to find air transportation to complete their journey; but there were no commercial flights scheduled for the next two days.\u0026nbsp; \"If they don\u0027t get me there on time, I\u0027ll have their scalps and their railroad! Can\u0027t we tell that damn conductor to hurry?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ve told him three times.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ll get him fired. He\u0027s given me nothing but a lot of alibis about all their messy technical troubles. I expect transportation, not alibis. They can\u0027t treat me like one of their day-coach passengers. I expect them to get me where I want to go when I want it. Don\u0027t they know that I\u0027m on this train?\"\u0026nbsp; \"They know it by now,\" said Laura Bradford. \"Shut up, Kip. You bore me.\"\u0026nbsp; Chalmers refilled his glass. The car was rocking and the glassware tinkled faintly on the shelves of the bar. The patches of starlit sky in the windows kept swaying jerkily, and it seemed as if the stars were tinkling against one another. They could see nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation window at the end of the car, except the small halos of red and green lanterns marking the rear of the train, and a brief stretch of rail running away from them into the darkness. A wall of rock was racing the train, and the stars dipped occasionally into a sudden break that outlined, high above them, the peaks of the mountains of Colorado.\u0026nbsp; \"Mountains . . .\" said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, with satisfaction.\u0026nbsp; \"It is a spectacle of this kind that makes one feel the insignificance of man.\u0027 What is this presumptuous little bit of rail, which crude materialists are so proud of building-compared to that eternal grandeur? No more than the basting thread of a seamstress on the hem of the garment of nature. If a single one of those granite giants chose to crumble, it would annihilate this train.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why should it choose to crumble?\" asked Laura Bradford, without any particular interest.\u0026nbsp; \"I think this damn train is going slower,\" said Kip Chalmers. \"Those bastards are slowing down, in spite of what I told them!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Well . . . it\u0027s the mountains, you know . . .\" said Lester Tuck.\u0026nbsp; \"Mountains be damned! Lester, what day is this? With all those damn changes of time, I can\u0027t tell which-\"\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s May twenty-seventh,\" sighed Lester Tuck.\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s May twenty-eighth,\" said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, glancing at his watch. \"It is now twelve minutes past midnight.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Jesus!\" cried Chalmers. \"Then the rally is today?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yep,\" said Lester Tuck.\u0026nbsp; \"We won\u0027t make it! We-\"\u0026nbsp; The train gave a sharper lurch, knocking the glass out of his hand.\u0026nbsp; The thin sound of its crash against the floor mixed with the screech of the wheel-flanges tearing against the rail of a sharp curve.\u0026nbsp; \"I say,\" asked Gilbert Keith-Worthing nervously, \"are your railroads safe?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Hell, yes!\" said Kip Chalmers. \"We\u0027ve got so many rules, regulations and controls that those bastards wouldn\u0027t dare not to be safe!. . . Lester, how far are we now? What\u0027s the next stop?”\u0026nbsp; \"There won\u0027t be any stop till Salt Lake City.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I mean, what\u0027s the next station?\"\u0026nbsp; Lester Tuck produced a soiled map, which he had been consulting every few minutes since nightfall. \"Winston,\" he said. \"Winston, Colorado.\"\u0026nbsp; Kip Chalmers reached for another glass.\u0026nbsp; \"Tinky Holloway said that Wesley said that if you don\u0027t win this election, you\u0027re through,\" said Laura Bradford. She sat sprawled in her chair, looking past Chalmers, studying her own face in a mirror on the wall of the lounge; she was bored and it amused her to needle his impotent anger.\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, he did, did he?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Uh-huh. Wesley doesn\u0027t want what\u0027s-his-name-whoever\u0027s running against you-to get into the Legislature. If you don\u0027t win, Wesley will be sore as hell. Tinky said-\"\u0026nbsp; \"Damn that bastard! He\u0027d better watch his own neck!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Wesley likes him very much.\" She added, \"Tinky Holloway wouldn\u0027t allow some miserable train to make him miss an important meeting. They wouldn\u0027t dare to hold him up.\"\u0026nbsp; Kip Chalmers sat staring at his glass. \"I\u0027m going to have the government seize all the railroads,\" he said, his voice low.\u0026nbsp; \"Really,\" said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, \"I don\u0027t see why you haven\u0027t done it long ago. This is the only country on earth backward enough to permit private ownership of railroads.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Well, we\u0027re catching up with you,\" said Kip Chalmers.\u0026nbsp; \"Your country is so incredibly naive. It\u0027s such an anachronism. All that talk about liberty and human rights-I haven\u0027t heard it since the days of my great-grandfather. It\u0027s nothing but a verbal luxury of the rich. After all, it doesn\u0027t make any difference to the poor whether their livelihood is at the mercy of an industrialist or of a bureaucrat.\"\u0026nbsp; \"The day of the industrialists is over. This is the day of-\"\u0026nbsp; The jolt felt as if the air within the car smashed them forward while the floor stopped under their feet. Kip Chalmers was flung down to the carpet, Gilbert Keith-Worthing was thrown across the table top, the lights were blasted out. Glasses crashed off the shelves, the steel of the walls screamed as if about to rip open, while a long, distant thud went like a convulsion through the wheels of the train.\u0026nbsp; When he raised his head, Chalmers saw that the car stood intact and still; he heard the moans of his companions and the first shriek of Laura Bradford\u0027s hysterics. He crawled along the floor to the doorway, wrenched it open, and tumbled down the steps. Far ahead, on the side of a curve, he saw moving flashlights and a red glow at a spot where the engine had no place to be. He stumbled through the darkness, bumping into half-clothed figures that waved the futile little flares of matches.\u0026nbsp; Somewhere along the line, he saw a man with a flashlight and seized his arm. It was the conductor.\u0026nbsp; \"What happened?\" gasped Chalmers.\u0026nbsp; \"Split rail,\" the conductor answered impassively. \"The engine went off the track.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Off . . . ?”\u0026nbsp; \"On its side.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Anybody . . . killed?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. The engineer\u0027s all right. The fireman is hurt.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Split rail? What do you mean, split rail?\"\u0026nbsp; The conductor\u0027s face had an odd look: it was grim, accusing and closed. \"Rail wears out, Mr. Chalmers,\" he answered with a strange kind of emphasis. \"Particularly on curves.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Didn\u0027t you know that it was worn out?\"\u0026nbsp; \"We knew.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Well, why didn\u0027t you have it replaced?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It was going to be replaced. But Mr. Locey cancelled that.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who is Mr. Locey?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The man who is not our Operating Vice-President.\"\u0026nbsp; Chalmers wondered why the conductor seemed to look at him as if something about the catastrophe were his fault. \"Well . . . well, aren\u0027t you going to put the engine back on the track?\"\u0026nbsp; \"That engine\u0027s never going to be put back on any track, from the looks of it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But . . . but it\u0027s got to move us!\"\u0026nbsp; \"It can\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; Beyond the few moving flares and the dulled sounds of screams, Chalmers sensed suddenly, not wanting to look at it, the black immensity of the mountains, the silence of hundreds of uninhabited miles, and the precarious strip of a ledge hanging between a wall of rock and an abyss. He gripped the conductor\u0027s arm tighter.\u0026nbsp; \"But . . . but what are we going to do?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The engineer\u0027s gone to call Winston.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Call? How?\"\u0026nbsp; \"There\u0027s a phone couple of miles down the track.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Will they get us out of here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"They will.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But . . .\" Then his mind made a connection with the past and the future, and his voice rose to a scream for the first time: \"How long will we have to wait?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know,\" said the conductor. He threw Chalmers\u0027 hand off his arm, and walked away.\u0026nbsp; The night operator of Winston Station listened to the phone message, dropped the receiver and raced up the stairs to shake the station agent out of bed. The station agent was a husky, surly drifter who had been assigned to the job ten days ago, by order of the new division superintendent. He stumbled dazedly to his feet, but he was knocked awake when the operator\u0027s words reached his brain.\u0026nbsp; \"What?\" he gasped. \"Jesus! The Comet? . . . Well, don\u0027t stand there shaking! Call Silver Springs!\"\u0026nbsp; The night dispatcher of the Division Headquarters at Silver Springs listened to the message, then telephoned Dave Mitchum, the new superintendent of the Colorado Division.\u0026nbsp; \"The Comet?\" gasped Mitchum, his hand pressing the telephone receiver to his ear, his feet hitting the floor and throwing him upright, out of bed. \"The engine done for? The Diesel?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, sir.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh God! Oh, God Almighty! What are we going to do?\" Then, remembering his position, he added, \"Well, send out the wrecking train.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Call the operator at Sherwood to hold all traffic.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What have you got on the sheet?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The Army Freight Special, westbound. But it\u0027s not due for about four hours. It\u0027s running late.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ll be right down. . . . Wait, listen, get Bill, Sandy and Clarence down by the time I get there. There\u0027s going to be hell to pay!\"\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum had always complained about injustice, because, he said, he had always had bad luck. He explained it by speaking darkly about the conspiracy of the big fellows, who would never give him a chance, though he did not explain just whom he meant by \"the big fellows.\" Seniority of service was his favorite topic of complaint and sole standard of value; he had been in the railroad business longer than many men who had advanced beyond him; this, he said, was proof of the social system\u0027s injustice-though he never explained just what he meant by \"the social system.\" He had worked for many railroads, but had not stayed long with any one of them. His employers had had no specific misdeeds to charge against him, but had simply eased him out, because he said, \"Nobody told me to!\" too often. He did not know that he owed his present job to a deal between James Taggart and Wesley Mouch: when Taggart traded to Mouch the secret of his sister\u0027s private life, in exchange for a raise in rates, Mouch made him throw in an extra favor, by their customary rules of bargaining, which consisted of squeezing all one could out of any given trade. The extra was a job for Dave Mitchum, who was the brother-in-law of Claude Slagenhop, who was the president of the Friends of Global Progress, who were regarded by Mouch as a valuable influence on public opinion. James Taggart pushed the responsibility of finding a job for Mitchum onto Clifton Locey. Locey pushed Mitchum into the first job that came up-superintendent of the Colorado Division-when the man holding it quit without notice. The man quit when the extra Diesel engine of Winston Station was given to Chick Morrison\u0027s Special.\u0026nbsp; \"What are we going to do?\" cried Dave Mitchum, rushing, half-dressed and groggy with sleep, into his office, where the chief dispatcher, the trainmaster and the road foreman of engines were waiting for him.\u0026nbsp; The three men did not answer. They were middle-aged men with years of railroad service behind them. A month ago, they would have volunteered their advice in any emergency; but they were beginning to learn that things had changed and that it was dangerous to speak.\u0026nbsp; \"What in hell are we going to do?\"\u0026nbsp; \"One thing is certain,\" said Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher. \"We can\u0027t send a train into the tunnel with a coal-burning engine.\"\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum\u0027s eyes grew sullen: he knew that this was the one thought on all their minds; he wished Brent had not named it.\u0026nbsp; \"Well, where do we get a Diesel?\" he asked angrily.\u0026nbsp; \"We don\u0027t,\" said the road foreman.\u0026nbsp; \"But we can\u0027t keep the Comet waiting on a siding all night!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Looks like we\u0027ll have to,\" said the trainmaster. \"What\u0027s the use of talking about it, Dave? You know that there is no Diesel anywhere on the division.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But Christ Almighty, how do they expect us to move trains without engines?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Miss Taggart didn\u0027t,\" said the road foreman. \"Mr. Locey does.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Bill,\" asked Mitchum, in the tone of pleading for a favor, \"isn\u0027t there anything transcontinental that\u0027s due tonight, with any sort of a Diesel?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The first one to come,\" said Bill Brent implacably, \"will be Number 236, the fast freight from San Francisco, which is due at Winston at seven-eighteen A.M.\" He added, \"That\u0027s the Diesel closest to us at this moment. I\u0027ve checked.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What about the Army Special?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Better not think about it, Dave. That one has superiority over everything on the line, including the Comet, by order of the Army. They\u0027re running late as it is-journal boxes caught fire twice. They\u0027re\u0026nbsp; carrying munitions for the West Coast arsenals. Better pray that nothing stops them on your division. If you think we\u0027ll catch hell for holding the Comet, it\u0027s nothing to what we\u0027ll catch if we try to stop that Special.\"\u0026nbsp; They remained silent. The windows were open to the summer night and they could hear the ringing of the telephone in the dispatcher\u0027s office downstairs. The signal lights winked over the deserted yards that had once been a busy division point.\u0026nbsp; Mitchum looked toward the roundhouse, where the black silhouettes of a few steam engines stood outlined in a dim light.\u0026nbsp; \"The tunnel-\" he said and stopped.\u0026nbsp; \"-is eight miles long,\" said the trainmaster, with a harsh emphasis.\u0026nbsp; \"I was only thinking,\" snapped Mitchum.\u0026nbsp; \"Better not think of it,\" said Brent softly.\u0026nbsp; \"I haven\u0027t said anything!\"\u0026nbsp; \"What was that talk you had with Dick Horton before he quit?\" the road foreman asked too innocently, as if the subject were irrelevant.\u0026nbsp; \"Wasn\u0027t it something about the ventilation system of the tunnel being on the bum? Didn\u0027t he say that that tunnel was hardly safe nowadays even for Diesel engines?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why do you bring that up?\" snapped Mitchum. \"I haven\u0027t said anything!\" Dick Horton, the division chief engineer, had quit three days after Mitchum\u0027s arrival.\u0026nbsp; \"I thought I\u0027d just mention it,\" the road foreman answered innocently.\u0026nbsp; \"Look, Dave,\" said Bill Brent, knowing that Mitchum would stall for another hour rather than formulate a decision, \"you know that there\u0027s only one thing to do: hold the Comet at Winston till morning, wait for Number 236, have her Diesel take the Comet through the tunnel, then let the Comet finish her run with the best coal-burner we can give her on the other side.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But how late will that make her?\"\u0026nbsp; Brent shrugged. \"Twelve hours-eighteen hours-who knows?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Eighteen hours-for the Comet? Christ, that\u0027s never happened before!\"\u0026nbsp; \"None of what\u0027s been happening to us has ever happened before,\" said Brent, with an astonishing sound of weariness in his brisk, competent voice.\u0026nbsp; \"But they\u0027ll blame us for it in New York! They\u0027ll put all the blame on us!\"\u0026nbsp; Brent shrugged. A month ago, he would have considered such an injustice inconceivable; today, he knew better.\u0026nbsp; \"I guess . . .\" said Mitchum miserably, \"I guess there\u0027s nothing else that we can do.\"\u0026nbsp; \"There isn\u0027t, Dave,\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh God! Why did this have to happen to us?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who is John Galt?\"\u0026nbsp; It was half-past two when the Comet, pulled by an old switch engine, jerked to a stop on a siding of Winston Station. Kip Chalmers glanced out with incredulous anger at the few shanties on a desolate mountainside and at the ancient hovel of a station.\u0026nbsp; \"Now what? What in hell are they stopping here for?\" he cried, and rang for the conductor.\u0026nbsp; With the return of motion and safety, his terror had turned into rage. He felt almost as if he had been cheated by having been made to experience an unnecessary fear. His companions were still clinging to the tables of the lounge; they felt too shaken to sleep.\u0026nbsp; \"How long?\" the conductor said impassively, in answer to his question. \"Till morning, Mr. Chalmers.\"\u0026nbsp; Chalmers stared at him, stupefied. \"We\u0027re going to stand here till morning?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, Mr. Chalmers.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But I have a rally in San Francisco in the evening!\"\u0026nbsp; The conductor did not answer.\u0026nbsp; \"Why? Why do we have to stand? Why in hell? What happened?\"\u0026nbsp; Slowly, patiently, with contemptuous politeness, the conductor gave him an exact account of the situation. But years ago, in grammar school, in high school, in college, Kip Chalmers had been taught that man does not and need not live by reason.\u0026nbsp; \"Damn your tunnel!\" he screamed. \"Do you think I\u0027m going to let you hold me up because of some miserable tunnel? Do you want to wreck vital national plans on account of a tunnel? Tell your engineer that I must be in San Francisco by evening and that he\u0027s got to get me there!\"\u0026nbsp; \"How?\"\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s your job, not mine!\"\u0026nbsp; \"There is no way to do it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then find a way, God damn you!\"\u0026nbsp; The conductor did not answer.\u0026nbsp; \"Do you think I\u0027ll let your miserable technological problems interfere with crucial social issues? Do you know who I am? Tell that engineer to start moving, if he values his job!\"\u0026nbsp; \"The engineer has his orders.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Orders be damned! I give the orders these days! Tell him to start at once!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Perhaps you\u0027d better speak to the station agent, Mr. Chalmers. I have no authority to answer you as I\u0027d like to,\" said the conductor, and walked out.\u0026nbsp; Chalmers leaped to his feet. \"Say, Kip . . .\" said Lester Tuck uneasily, \"maybe it\u0027s true . . . maybe they can\u0027t do it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"They can if they have to!\" snapped Chalmers, marching resolutely to the door.\u0026nbsp; Years ago, in college, he had been taught that the only effective means to impel men to action was fear.\u0026nbsp; In the dilapidated office of Winston Station, he confronted a sleepy man with slack, worn features, and a frightened young boy who sat at the operator\u0027s desk. They listened, in silent stupor, to a stream of profanity such as they had never heard from any section gang.\u0026nbsp; \"-and it\u0027s not my problem how you get the train through the tunnel, that\u0027s for you to figure out!\" Chalmers concluded. \"But if you don\u0027t get me an engine and don\u0027t start that train, you can kiss good-bye to your jobs, your work permits and this whole goddamn railroad!\"\u0026nbsp; The station agent had never heard of Kip Chalmers and did not know the nature of his position. But he knew that this was the day when unknown men in undefined positions held unlimited power-the power of life or death.\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s not up to us, Mr. Chalmers,\" he said pleadingly. \"We don\u0027t issue the orders out here. The order came from Silver Springs. Suppose you telephone Mr. Mitchum and-\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who\u0027s Mr. Mitchum?\"\u0026nbsp; \"He\u0027s the division superintendent at Silver Springs. Suppose you send him a message to-\"\u0026nbsp; \"I should bother with a division superintendent! I\u0027ll send a message to Jim Taggart-that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do!\"\u0026nbsp; Before the station agent had time to recover, Chalmers whirled to the boy, ordering, \"You-take this down and send it at once!\"\u0026nbsp; It was a message which, a month ago, the station agent would not have accepted from any passenger; the rules forbade it; but he was not certain about any rules any longer: Mr. James Taggart, New York City. Am held up on the Comet at Winston, Colorado, by the incompetence of your men, who refuse to give me an engine. Have meeting in San Francisco in the evening of top-level national importance. If you don\u0027t move my train at once, I\u0027ll let you guess the consequences. Kip Chalmers.\u0026nbsp; After the boy had transmitted the words onto the wires that stretched from pole to pole across a continent as guardians of the Taggart track-after Kip Chalmers had returned to his car to wait for an answer-the station agent telephoned Dave Mitchum, who was his friend, and read to him the text of the message. He heard Mitchum groan in answer.\u0026nbsp; \"I thought I\u0027d tell you, Dave. I never heard of the guy before, but maybe he\u0027s somebody important.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know!\" moaned Mitchum. \"Kip Chalmers? You see his name in the newspapers all the time, right in with all the top-level boys, I don\u0027t know what he is, but if he\u0027s from Washington, we can\u0027t take any chances. Oh Christ, what are we going to do?\"\u0026nbsp; We can\u0027t take any chances-thought the Taggart operator in New York, and transmitted the message by telephone to James Taggart\u0027s home. It was close to six A.M. in New York, and James Taggart was awakened out of the fitful sleep of a restless night. He listened to the telephone, his face sagging. He felt the same fear as the station agent of Winston, and for the same reason.\u0026nbsp; He called the home of Clifton Locey. All the rage which he could not pour upon Kip Chalmers, was poured over the telephone wire upon Clifton Locey. \"Do something!\" screamed Taggart. \"I don\u0027t care what you do, it\u0027s your job, not mine, but see to it that that train gets through! What in hell is going on? I never heard of the Comet being held up! Is that how you run your department? It\u0027s a fine thing when important passengers have to start sending messages to me! At least, when my sister ran the place, I wasn\u0027t awakened in the middle of the night over every spike that broke in Iowa-Colorado, I mean!\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m so sorry, Jim,\" said Clifton Locey smoothly, in a tone that balanced apology, reassurance and the right degree of patronizing confidence. \"It\u0027s just a misunderstanding. It\u0027s somebody\u0027s stupid mistake. Don\u0027t worry, I’ll take care of it. I was, as a matter of fact, in bed, but I\u0027ll attend to it at once.\"\u0026nbsp; Clifton Locey was not in bed; he had just returned from a round of night clubs, in the company of a young lady. He asked her to wait and hurried to the offices of Taggart Transcontinental. None of the night staff who saw him there could say why he chose to appear in person, but neither could they say that it had been unnecessary. He rushed in and out of several offices, was seen by many people and gave an impression of great activity. The only physical result of it was an order that went over the wires to Dave Mitchum, superintendent of the Colorado Division: \"Give an engine to Mr. Chalmers at once. Send the Comet through safely and without unnecessary delay. If you are unable to perform your duties, I shall hold you responsible before the Unification Board. Clifton Locey.\"\u0026nbsp; Then, calling his girl friend to join him, Clifton Locey drove to a country roadhouse-to make certain that no one would be able to find him in the next few hours.\u0026nbsp; The dispatcher at Silver Springs was baffled by the order that he handed to Dave Mitchum, but Dave Mitchum understood. He knew that no railroad order would ever speak in such terms as giving an engine to a passenger; he knew that the thing was a show piece, he guessed what sort of show was being staged, and he felt a cold sweat at the realization of who was being framed as the goat of the show.\u0026nbsp; \"What\u0027s the matter, Dave?\" asked the trainmaster.\u0026nbsp; Mitchum did not answer. He seized the telephone, his hands shaking as he begged for a connection to the Taggart operator in New York, He looked like an animal in a trap.\u0026nbsp; He begged the New York operator to get him Mr. Clifton Locey\u0027s home. The operator tried. There was no answer. He begged the operator to keep on trying and to try every number he could think of, where Mr. Locey might be found. The operator promised and Mitchum hung up, but knew that it was useless to wait or to speak to anyone in Mr. Locey\u0027s department.\u0026nbsp; \"What\u0027s the matter, Dave?\"\u0026nbsp; Mitchum handed him the order-and saw by the look on the trainmaster\u0027s face that the trap was as bad as he had suspected.\u0026nbsp; He called the Region Headquarters of Taggart Transcontinental at Omaha, Nebraska, and begged to speak to the general manager of the region. There was a brief silence on the wire, then the voice of the Omaha operator told him that the general manager had resigned and vanished three days ago-\"over a little trouble with Mr. Locey,\" the voice added.\u0026nbsp; He asked to speak to the assistant general manager in charge of his particular district; but the assistant was out of town for the week end and could not be reached.\u0026nbsp; \"Get me somebody else!\" Mitchum screamed. \"Anybody, of any district! For Christ\u0027s sake, get me somebody who\u0027ll tell me what to do!\"\u0026nbsp; The man who came on the wire was the assistant general manager of the Iowa-Minnesota District.\u0026nbsp; \"What?\" he interrupted at Mitchum\u0027s first words. \"At Winston, Colorado? Why in hell are you calling me? . . . No, don\u0027t tell me what happened, I don\u0027t want to know it! . . . No, I said! No! You\u0027re not going to frame me into having to explain afterwards why I did or didn\u0027t do anything about whatever it is. It\u0027s not my problem! . . . Speak to some region executive, don\u0027t pick on me, what do I have to do with Colorado? . . . Oh hell, I don\u0027t know, get the chief engineer, speak to him!\"\u0026nbsp; The chief engineer of the Central Region answered impatiently, \"Yes? What? What is it?\"-and Mitchum rushed desperately to explain. When the chief engineer heard that there was no Diesel, he snapped, \"Then hold the train, of course!\" When he heard about Mr. Chalmers, he said, his voice suddenly subdued, \"Hm . . . Kip Chalmers? Of Washington? . . . Well, I don\u0027t know. That would be a matter for Mr. Locey to decide.\" When Mitchum said, \"Mr. Locey ordered me to arrange it, but-\" the chief engineer snapped in great relief, \"Then do exactly as Mr. Locey says!\" and hung up.\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum replaced the telephone receiver cautiously. He did not scream any longer. Instead, he-tiptoed to a chair, almost as if he were sneaking. He sat looking at Mr. Locey\u0027s order for a long time.\u0026nbsp; Then he snatched a glance about the room. The dispatcher was busy at his telephone. The trainmaster and the road foreman were there, but they pretended that they were not waiting. He wished Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher, would go home; Bill Brent stood in a corner, watching him.\u0026nbsp; Brent was a short, thin man with broad shoulders; he was forty, but looked younger; he had the pale face of an office worker and the hard, lean features of a cowboy. He was the best dispatcher on the system.\u0026nbsp; Mitchum rose abruptly and walked upstairs to his office, clutching Locey\u0027s order in his hand.\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum was not good at understanding problems of engineering and transportation, but he understood men like Clifton Locey. He understood the kind of game the New York executives were playing and what they were now doing to him. The order did not tell him to give Mr. Chalmers a coal-burning engine-just \"an engine.\" If the time came to answer questions, wouldn\u0027t Mr. Locey gasp in shocked indignation that he had expected a division superintendent to know that only a Diesel engine could be meant in that order? The order stated that he was to send the Comet through \"safely\"-wasn\u0027t a division superintendent expected to know what was safe?-\"and without unnecessary delay.\" What was\u0026nbsp; an unnecessary delay? If the possibility of a major disaster was involved, wouldn\u0027t a delay of a week or a month be considered necessary?\u0026nbsp; The New York executives did not care, thought Mitchum; they did not care whether Mr. Chalmers reached his meeting on time, or whether an unprecedented catastrophe struck their rails; they cared only about making sure that they would not be blamed for either. If he held the train, they would make him the scapegoat to appease the anger of Mr. Chalmers; if he sent the train through and it did not reach the western portal of the tunnel, they would put the blame on his incompetence; they would claim that he had acted against their orders, in either case. What would he be able to prove? To whom? One could prove nothing to a tribunal that had no stated policy, no defined procedure, no rules of evidence, no binding principles-a tribunal, such as the Unification Board, that pronounced men guilty or innocent as it saw fit, with no standard of guilt or innocence.\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum knew nothing about the philosophy of law; but he knew that when a court is not bound by any rules, it is not bound by any facts, and then a hearing is not an issue of justice, but an issue of men, and your fate depends not on what you have or have not done, but on whom you do or do not know. He asked himself what chance he would have at such a hearing against Mr. James Taggart, Mr. Clifton Locey, Mr. Kip Chalmers and their powerful friends.\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum had spent his life slipping around the necessity of ever making a decision; he had done it by waiting to be told and never being certain of anything. All that he now allowed into his brain was a long, indignant whine against injustice. Fate, he thought, had singled him out for an unfair amount of bad luck: he was being framed by his superiors on the only good job he had ever held. He had never been taught to understand that the manner in which he obtained this job, and the frame-up, were inextricable parts of a single whole.\u0026nbsp; As he looked at Locey\u0027s order, he thought that he could hold the Comet, attach Mr. Chalmers car to an engine and send it into the tunnel, alone. But he shook his head before the thought was fully formed: he knew that this would force Mr. Chalmers to recognize the nature of the risk; Mr. Chalmers would refuse; he would continue to demand a safe and non-existent engine. And more: this would mean that he, Mitchum, would have to assume responsibility, admit full knowledge of the danger, stand in the open and identify the exact nature of the situation-the one act which the policy of his superiors was based on evading, the one key to their game.\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum was not the man to rebel against his background or to question the moral code of those in charge. The choice he made was not to challenge, but to follow the policy of his superiors. Bill Brent could have- beaten him in any contest of technology, but here was an endeavor at which he could beat Bill Brent without effort. There had once been a society where men needed the particular talents of Bill Brent, if they wished to survive; what they needed now was the talent of Dave Mitchum.\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum sat down at his secretary\u0027s typewriter and, by means of two fingers, carefully typed out an order to the trainmaster and another to the road foreman. The first instructed the trainmaster to summon a locomotive crew at once, for a purpose described only as \"an emergency\"; the second instructed the road foreman to \"send the best engine available to Winston, to stand by for emergency assistance.\"\u0026nbsp; He put carbon copies of the orders into his own pocket, then opened the door, yelled for the night dispatcher to come up and handed him the two orders for the two men downstairs. The night dispatcher was a conscientious young boy who trusted his superiors and knew that discipline was the first rule of the railroad business. He was astonished that Mitchum should wish to send written orders down one flight of stairs, but he asked no questions, Mitchum waited nervously. After a while, he saw the figure of the road foreman walking across the yards toward the roundhouse. He felt relieved: the two men had not come up to confront him in person; they had understood and they would play the game as he was playing it.\u0026nbsp; The road foreman walked across the yards, looking down at the ground. He was thinking of his wife, his two children and the house which he had spent a lifetime to own. He knew what his superiors were doing and he wondered whether he should refuse to obey them. He had never been afraid of losing his job; with the confidence of a competent man, he had known that if he quarreled with one employer, he would always be able to find another. Now, he was afraid; he had no right to quit or to seek a job; if he defied an employer, he would be delivered into the unanswerable power of a single Board, and if the Board ruled against him, it would mean being sentenced to the slow death of starvation: it would mean being barred from any employment. He knew that the Board would rule against him; he knew that the key to the dark, capricious mystery of the Board\u0027s contradictory decisions was the secret power of pull. What chance would he have against Mr. Chalmers? There had been a time when the self-interest of his employers had demanded that he exercise his utmost ability.\u0026nbsp; Now, ability was not wanted any longer. There had been a time when he had been required to do his best and rewarded accordingly. Now, he could expect nothing but punishment, if he tried to follow his conscience. There had been a time when he had been expected to think.\u0026nbsp; Now, they did not want him to think, only to obey. They did not want him to have a conscience any longer. Then why should he raise his voice? For whose sake? He thought of the passengers-the three hundred passengers aboard the Comet. He thought of his children. He had a son in high school and a daughter, nineteen, of whom he was fiercely, painfully proud, because she was recognized as the most beautiful girl in town. He asked himself whether he could deliver his children to the fate of the children of the unemployed, as he had seen them in the blighted areas, in the settlements around closed factories and along the tracks of discontinued railroads. He saw, in astonished horror, that the choice which he now had to make was between the lives of his children and the lives of the passengers on the Comet. A conflict of this kind had never been possible before. It was by protecting the safety of the passengers that he had earned the security of his children; he had served one by serving the other; there had been no clash of interests, no call for victims. Now, if he wanted to save the passengers, he had to do it at the price of his children.\u0026nbsp; He remembered dimly the sermons he had heard about the beauty of self-immolation, about the virtue of sacrificing to others that which was one\u0027s dearest. He knew nothing about the philosophy of ethics; but he knew suddenly-not in words, but in the form of a dark, angry, savage pain-that if this was virtue, then he wanted no part of it.\u0026nbsp; He walked into the roundhouse and ordered a large, ancient coal burning locomotive to be made ready for the run to Winston.\u0026nbsp; The trainmaster reached for the telephone in the dispatcher\u0027s office, to summon an engine crew, as ordered. But his hand stopped, holding the receiver. It struck him suddenly that he was summoning men to their death, and that of the twenty lives listed on the sheet before him, two would be ended by his choice. He felt a physical sensation of cold, nothing more; he felt no concern, only a puzzled, indifferent astonishment. It had never been his job to call men out to die; his job had been to call them out to earn their living. It was strange, he thought; and it was strange that his hand had stopped; what made it stop was like something he would have felt twenty years ago-no, he thought, strange, only one month ago, not longer.\u0026nbsp; He was forty-eight years old. He had no family, no friends, no ties to any living being in the world. Whatever capacity for devotion he had possessed, the capacity which others scatter among many random concerns, he had given it whole to the person of his young brother -the brother, his junior by twenty-five years, whom he had brought up. He had sent him through a technological college, and he had known, as had all the teachers, that the boy had the mark of genius on the forehead of his grim, young face. With the same single-tracked devotion as his brother\u0027s, the boy had cared for nothing but his studies, not for sports or parties or girls, only for the vision of the things he was going to create as an inventor. He had graduated from college and had gone, on a salary unusual for his age, into the research laboratory of a great electrical concern in Massachusetts.\u0026nbsp; This was now May 28, thought the trainmaster. It was on May 1 that Directive 10-289 had been issued. It was on the evening of May 1 that he had been informed that his brother had committed suicide.\u0026nbsp; The trainmaster had heard it said that the directive was necessary to save the country. He could not know whether this was true or not; he had no way of knowing what was necessary to save a country. But driven by some feeling which he could not express, he had walked into the office of the editor of the local newspaper and demanded that they publish the story of his brother\u0027s death. \"People have to know it,\" had been all he could give as his reason. He had been unable to explain that the bruised connections of his mind had formed the wordless conclusion that if this was done by the will of the people, then the people had to know it; he could not believe that they would do it, if they knew. The editor had refused; he had stated that it would be bad for the country\u0027s morale.\u0026nbsp; The trainmaster knew nothing about political philosophy; but he knew that that had been the moment when he lost all concern for the life or death of any human being or of the country. He thought, holding the telephone receiver, that maybe he should warn the men whom he was about to call. They trusted him; it would never occur to them that he could knowingly send them to their death.\u0026nbsp; But he shook his head: this was only an old thought, last year\u0027s thought, a remnant of the time when he had trusted them, too. It did not matter now. His brain worked slowly, as if he were dragging his thoughts through a vacuum where no emotion responded to spur them on; he thought that there would be trouble if he warned anyone, there would be some sort of fight and it was he who had to make some great effort to start it. He had forgotten what it was that one started this sort of fight for. Truth? Justice? Brother-love? He did not want to make an effort. He was very tired. If he warned all the men on his list, he thought, there would be no one to run that engine, so he would save two lives and also three hundred lives aboard the Comet.\u0026nbsp; But nothing responded to the figures in his mind; \"lives\" was just a word, it had no meaning. He raised the telephone receiver to his ear, he called two numbers, he summoned an engineer and a fireman to report for duty at once.\u0026nbsp; Engine Number 306 had left for Winston, when Dave Mitchum came downstairs. \"Get a track motor car ready for me,\" he ordered, \"I\u0027m going to run up to Fairmount.\" Fairmount was a small station, twenty miles east on the line. The men nodded, asking no questions. Bill Brent was not among them. Mitchum walked into Brent\u0027s office. Brent was there, sitting silently at his desk; he seemed to be waiting.\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m going to Fairmount,\" said Mitchum; his voice was aggressively too casual, as if implying that no answer was necessary. \"They had a Diesel there couple of weeks ago . . . you know, emergency repairs or something. . . . I\u0027m going down to see if we could use it.\"\u0026nbsp; He paused, but Brent said nothing.\u0026nbsp; \"The way things stack up,\" said Mitchum, not looking at him, \"we can\u0027t hold that train till morning. We\u0027ve got to take a chance, one way or another. Now I think maybe this Diesel will do it, but that\u0027s the last one we can try for. So if you don\u0027t hear from me in half an hour, sign the order and send the Comet through with Number 306 to pull her.\"\u0026nbsp; Whatever Brent had thought, he could not believe it when he heard it. He did not answer at once; then he said, very quietly, \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What do you mean, no?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I won\u0027t do it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What do you mean, you won\u0027t? It\u0027s an order!\"\u0026nbsp; \"I won\u0027t do it.\" Brent\u0027s voice had the firmness of certainty unclouded by any emotion.\u0026nbsp; \"Are you refusing to obey an order?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I am.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But you have no right to refuse! And I\u0027m not going to argue about it, either. It\u0027s what I\u0027ve decided, it\u0027s my responsibility and I\u0027m not asking for your opinion. Your job is to take my orders.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Will you give me that order in writing?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why, God damn you, are you hinting that you don\u0027t trust me? Are you . . . ?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why do you have to go to Fairmount, Dave? Why can\u0027t you telephone them about that Diesel, if you think that they have one?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re not going to tell me how to do my job! You\u0027re not going to sit there and question me! You\u0027re going to keep your trap shut and do as you\u0027re told or I\u0027ll give you a chance to talk-to the Unification Board!\"\u0026nbsp; It was hard to decipher emotions on Brent\u0027s cowboy face, but Mitchum saw something that resembled a look of incredulous horror; only it was horror at some sight of his own, not at the words, and it had no quality of fear, not the kind of fear Mitchum had hoped for.\u0026nbsp; Brent knew that tomorrow morning the issue would be his word against Mitchum\u0027s; Mitchum would deny having given the order; Mitchum would show written proof that Engine Number 306 had been sent to Winston only \"to stand by,\" and would produce witnesses that he had gone to Fairmount in search of a Diesel; Mitchum would claim that the fatal order had been issued by and on the sole responsibility of Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher, it would not be much of a case, not a case that could bear close study, but it would be enough for the Unification Board, whose policy was consistent only in not permitting anything to be studied closely. Brent knew that he could play the same game and pass the frame-up on to another victim, he knew that he had the brains to work it out-except that he would rather be dead than do it.\u0026nbsp; It was not the sight of Mitchum that made him sit still in horror. It was the realization that there was no one whom he could call to expose this thing and stop it-no superior anywhere on the line, from Colorado to Omaha to New York. They were in on it, all of them, they were doing the same, they had given Mitchum the lead and the method. It was Dave Mitchum who now belonged on this railroad and he, Bill Brent, who did not.\u0026nbsp; As Bill Brent had learned to see, by a single glance at a few numbers on a sheet of paper, the entire trackage of a division-so he was now able to see the whole of his own life and the full price of the decision he was making. He had not fallen in love until he was past his youth; he had been thirty-six when he had found the woman he wanted. He had been engaged to her for the last four years; he had had to wait, because he had a mother to support and a widowed sister with three children. He had never been afraid of burdens, because he had known his ability to carry them, and he had never assumed an obligation unless he was certain that he could fulfill it. He had waited, he had saved his money, and now he had reached the time when he felt himself free to be happy. He was to be married in a few weeks, this coming June. He thought of it, as he sat at his desk, looking at Dave Mitchum, but the thought aroused no hesitation, only regret and a distant sadness-distant, because he knew that he could not let it be part of this moment.\u0026nbsp; Bill Brent knew nothing about epistemology; but he knew that man must live by his own rational perception of reality, that he cannot act against it or escape it or find a substitute for it-and that there is no other way for him to live.\u0026nbsp; He rose to his feet. \"It\u0027s true that so long as I hold this job, I cannot refuse to obey you,\" he said. \"But I can, if I quit. So I\u0027m quitting.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re what?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m quitting, as of this moment.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But you have no right to quit, you goddamn bastard! Don\u0027t you know that? Don\u0027t you know that I\u0027ll have you thrown in jail for it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"If you want to send the sheriff for me in the morning, I\u0027ll be at home. I won\u0027t try to escape. There\u0027s no place to go.\"\u0026nbsp; Dave Mitchum was six-foot-two and had the build of a bruiser, but he stood shaking with fury and terror over the delicate figure of Bill Brent. \"You can\u0027t quit! There\u0027s a law against it! I\u0027ve got a law! You can\u0027t walk out on me! I won\u0027t let you out! I won\u0027t let you leave this building tonight!\"\u0026nbsp; Brent walked to the door. \"Will you repeat that order you gave me, in front of the others? No? Then I will!\"\u0026nbsp; As he pulled the door open, Mitchum\u0027s fist shot out, smashed into his face and knocked him down.\u0026nbsp; The trainmaster and the road foreman stood in the open doorway.\u0026nbsp; \"He quit!\" screamed Mitchum. \"The yellow bastard quit at a time like this! He\u0027s a law-breaker and a coward!\"\u0026nbsp; In the slow effort of rising from the floor, through the haze of blood running into his eyes, Bill Brent looked up at the two men. He saw that they understood, but he saw the closed faces of men who did not want to understand, did not want to interfere and hated him for putting them on the spot in the name of justice. He said nothing, rose to his feet and walked out of the building.\u0026nbsp; Mitchum avoided looking at the others. \"Hey, you,\" he called, jerking his head at the night dispatcher across the room. \"Come here. You\u0027ve got to take over at once.\"\u0026nbsp; With the door closed, he repeated to the boy the story of the Diesel at Fairmount, as he had given it to Brent, and the order to send the Comet through with Engine Number 306, if the boy did not hear from him in half an hour. The boy was in no condition to think, to speak or to understand anything: he kept seeing the blood on the face of Bill Brent, who had been his idol. \"Yes, sir,\" he answered numbly Dave Mitchum departed for Fairmount, announcing to every yardman, switchman and wiper in sight, as he boarded the track motor car that he was going in search of a Diesel for the Comet.\u0026nbsp; The night dispatcher sat at his desk, watching the clock and the telephone, praying that the telephone would ring and let him hear from Mr. Mitchum. But the half-hour went by in silence, and whet there were only three minutes left, the boy felt a terror he could not explain, except that he did not want to send that order, He turned to the trainmaster and the road foreman, asking hesitantly, \"Mr. Mitchum gave me an order before he left, but I wonder whether I ought to send it, because I . . . I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right. He said-\"\u0026nbsp; The trainmaster turned away; he felt no pity: the boy was about the same age as his brother had been.\u0026nbsp; The road foreman snapped, \"Do just as Mr. Mitchum told you. You\u0027re not supposed to think,\" and walked out of the room.\u0026nbsp; The responsibility that James Taggart and Clifton Locey had evaded now rested on the shoulders of a trembling, bewildered boy. He hesitated, then he buttressed his courage with the thought that one did not doubt the good faith and the competence of railroad executives. He did not know that his vision of a railroad and its executives was that of a century ago.\u0026nbsp; With the conscientious precision of a railroad man, in the moment when the hand of the clock ended the half-hour, he signed his name to the order instructing the Comet to proceed with Engine Number 306, and transmitted the order to Winston Station.\u0026nbsp; The station agent at Winston shuddered when he looked at the order, but he was not the man to defy authority. He told himself that the tunnel was not, perhaps, as dangerous as he thought. He told himself that the best policy, these days, was not to think. When he handed their copies of the order to the conductor and the engineer of the Comet, the conductor glanced slowly about the room, from face to face, folded the slip of paper, put it into his pocket and walked out without a word.\u0026nbsp; The engineer stood looking at the paper for a moment, then threw it down and said, \"I\u0027m not going to do it. And if it\u0027s come to where this railroad hands out orders like this one, I\u0027m not going to work for it, either. Just list me as having quit.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But you can\u0027t quit!\" cried the station agent, \"They\u0027ll arrest you for it!\"\u0026nbsp; \"If they find me,\" said the engineer, and walked out of the station into the vast darkness of the mountain night.\u0026nbsp; The engineer from Silver Springs, who had brought in Number 306, was sitting in a corner of the room. He chuckled and said, \"He\u0027s yellow.\"\u0026nbsp; The station agent turned to him. \"Will you do it, Joe? Will you take the Comet?\"\u0026nbsp; Joe Scott was drunk. There had been a time when a railroad man, reporting for duty with any sign of intoxication, would have been regarded as a doctor arriving for work with sores of smallpox on his face. But Joe Scott was a privileged person. Three months ago, he had been fired for an infraction of safety rules, which had caused a major wreck; two weeks ago, he had been reinstated in his job by order of the Unification Board. He was a friend of Fred Kinnan; he protected Kinnan\u0027s interests in his union, not against the employers, but against the membership.\u0026nbsp; \"Sure,\" said Joe Scott. \"I\u0027ll take the Comet. I\u0027ll get her through, if I go fast enough.\"\u0026nbsp; The fireman of Number 306 had remained in the cab of his engine.\u0026nbsp; He looked up uneasily, when they came to switch his engine to the head end of the Comet; he looked up at the red and green lights of the tunnel, hanging in the distance above twenty miles of curves. But he was a placid, amicable fellow, who made a good fireman with no hope of ever rising to engineer; his husky muscles were his only asset.\u0026nbsp; He felt certain that his superiors knew what they were doing, so he did not venture any questions.\u0026nbsp; The conductor stood by the rear end of the Comet. He looked at the lights of the tunnel, then at the long chain of the Comet\u0027s windows. A few windows were lighted, but most of them showed only the feeble blue glow of night lamps edging the lowered blinds. He thought that he should rouse the passengers and warn them. There had been a time when he had placed the safety of the passengers above his own, not by reason of love for his fellow men, but because that responsibility was part of his job, which he accepted and felt pride in fulfilling. Now, he felt a contemptuous indifference and no desire to save them. They had asked for and accepted Directive 10-289, he thought, they went on living and daily turning away in evasion from the kind of verdicts that the Unification Board was passing on defenseless victims-why shouldn\u0027t he now turn away from them? If he saved their lives, not one of them would come forward to defend him when the Unification Board would convict him for disobeying orders, for creating a panic, for delaying Mr. Chalmers. He had no desire to be a martyr for the sake of allowing people safely to indulge in their own irresponsible evil.\u0026nbsp; When the moment came, he raised his lantern and signaled the engineer to start.\u0026nbsp; \"See?\" said Kip Chalmers triumphantly to Lester Tuck, as the wheels under their feet shuddered forward. \"Fear is the only practical means to deal with people.\"\u0026nbsp; The conductor stepped onto the vestibule of the last car. No one saw him as he went down the steps of the other side, slipped off the train and vanished into the darkness of the mountains.\u0026nbsp; A switchman stood ready to throw the switch that would send the Comet from the siding onto the main track. He looked at the Comet as it came slowly toward him. It was only a blazing white globe with a beam stretching high above his head, and a jerky thunder trembling through the rail under his feet. He knew that the switch should not be thrown. He thought of the night, ten years ago, when he had risked his life in a flood to save a train from a washout. But he knew that times had changed. In the moment when he threw the switch and saw the headlight jerk sidewise, he knew that he would now hate his job for the rest of his life.\u0026nbsp; The Comet uncoiled from the siding into a thin, straight line, and went on into the mountains, with the beam of the headlight like an extended arm pointing the way, and the lighted glass curve of the observation lounge ending it off.\u0026nbsp; Some of the passengers aboard the Comet were awake. As the train started its coiling ascent, they saw the small cluster of Winston\u0027s lights at the bottom of the darkness beyond their windows, then the same darkness, but with red and green lights by the hole of a tunnel on the upper edge of the windowpanes. The lights of Winston kept growing smaller, each time they appeared; the black hole of the tunnel kept growing larger. A black veil went streaking past the windows at times, dimming the lights: it was the heavy smoke from the coal-burning engine.\u0026nbsp; As the tunnel came closer, they saw, on the edge of the sky far to the south, in a void of space and rock, a spot of living fire twisting in the wind. They did not know what it was and did not care to learn.\u0026nbsp; It is said that catastrophes are a matter of pure chance, and there were those who would have said that the passengers of the Comet were not guilty or responsible for the thing that happened to them.\u0026nbsp; The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 1, was a professor of sociology who taught that individual ability is of no consequence, that individual effort is futile, that an individual conscience is a useless luxury, that there is no individual mind or character or achievement, that everything is achieved collectively, and that it\u0027s masses that count, not men.\u0026nbsp; The man in Roomette 7, Car No. 2, was a journalist who wrote that it is proper and moral to use compulsion \"for a good cause,\" who believed that he had the right to unleash physical force upon others-to wreck lives, throttle ambitions, strangle desires, violate convictions, to imprison, to despoil, to murder-for the sake of whatever he chose to consider as his own idea of \"a good cause,\" which did not even have to be an idea, since he had never defined what he regarded as the good, but had merely stated that he went by \"a feeling\"-a feeling unrestrained by any knowledge, since he considered emotion superior to knowledge and relied solely on his own \"good intentions\" and on the power of a gun.\u0026nbsp; The woman in Roomette 10, Car No. 3, was an elderly schoolteacher who had spent her life turning class after class of helpless children into miserable cowards, by teaching them that the will of the majority is the only standard of good and evil, that a majority may do anything it pleases, that they must not assert their own personalities, but must do as others were doing.\u0026nbsp; The man in Drawing Room B, Car No, 4, was a newspaper publisher who believed that men are evil by nature and unfit for freedom, that their basic instincts, if left unchecked, are to lie, to rob and to murder one another-and, therefore, men must be ruled by means of lies, robbery and murder, which must be made the exclusive privilege of the rulers, for the purpose of forcing men to work, teaching them to be moral and keeping them within the bounds of order and justice.\u0026nbsp; The man in Bedroom H, Car No. 5, was a businessman who had acquired his business, an ore mine, with the help of a government loan, under the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.\u0026nbsp; The man in Drawing Room A, Car No. 6, was a financier who had made a fortune by buying \"frozen\" railroad bonds and getting his friends in Washington to \"defreeze\" them.\u0026nbsp; The man in Seat 5, Car No, 7, was a worker who believed that he had \"a right\" to a job, whether his employer wanted him or not.\u0026nbsp; The woman in Roomette 6, Car No. 8, was a lecturer who believed that, as a consumer, she had \"a right\" to transportation, whether the railroad people wished to provide it or not.\u0026nbsp; The man in Roomette 2, Car No. 9, was a professor of economics who advocated the abolition of private property, explaining that intelligence plays no part in industrial production, that man\u0027s mind is conditioned by material tools, that anybody can run a factory or a railroad and it\u0027s only a matter of seizing the machinery.\u0026nbsp; The woman in Bedroom D, Car No. 10, was a mother who had put her two children to sleep in the berth above her, carefully tucking them in, protecting them from drafts and jolts; a mother whose husband held a government job enforcing directives, which she defended by saying, \"I don\u0027t care, it\u0027s only the rich that they hurt. After all, I must think of my children.\"\u0026nbsp; The man in Roomette 3, Car No. 11, was a sniveling little neurotic who wrote cheap little plays into which, as a social message, he inserted cowardly little obscenities to the effect that all businessmen were scoundrels.\u0026nbsp; The woman in Roomette 9, Car No. 12, was a housewife who believed that she had the right to elect politicians, of whom she knew nothing, to control giant industries, of which she had no knowledge.\u0026nbsp; The man in Bedroom F, Car No. 13, was a lawyer who had said, \"Me? I\u0027ll find a way to get along under any political system.\"\u0026nbsp; The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 14, was a professor of philosophy who taught that there is no mind-how do you know that the tunnel is dangerous?--no reality-how can you prove that the tunnel exists?-no logic-why do you claim that trains cannot move without motive power?-no principles-why should you be bound by the law of cause and-effect?-no rights-why shouldn\u0027t you attach men to their jobs by force?-no morality-what\u0027s moral about running a railroad?-no absolutes-what difference does it make to you whether you live or die, anyway? He taught that we know nothing-why oppose the orders of your superiors?-that we can never be certain of anything-how do you know you\u0027re right?-that we must act on the expediency of the moment-you don\u0027t want to risk your job, do you?\u0026nbsp; The man in Drawing Room B, Car No. 15, was an heir who had inherited his fortune, and who had kept repeating, \"Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal?\"\u0026nbsp; The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 16, was a humanitarian who had said, \"The men of ability? I do not care what or if they are made to suffer. They must be penalized in order to support the incompetent. Frankly, I do not care whether this is just or not. I take pride in not caring to grant any justice to the able, where mercy to the needy is concerned.\"\u0026nbsp; These passengers were awake; there was not a man aboard the train who did not share one or more of their ideas. As the train went into the tunnel, the flame of Wyatt\u0027s Torch was the last thing they saw on earth. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551/46038.html","bookId":1296,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:41:03 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:41:03 AM"}
