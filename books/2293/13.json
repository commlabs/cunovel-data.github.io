You relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to unzip. It marked the second time in my life I’d seen Rob’s hand on his zipper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sick of it. “Let me help you.” I sprang up and around him, gripping my star between fingertip and thumb, and in one swift flick, I slashed his pants front to back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the—?” His voice was a high-pitched squeak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed away, watching in amusement. “By the way, you touch your pants one more time in front of me, I swear to you, it’ll be your last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted at his crotch, making sure everything was intact. “What the fuck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let myself laugh. “You seemed so anxious to air it out. I thought I’d give you a hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached around, and I saw the moment he realized there was a giant gap where the seat of his pants should’ve been. “You little bitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax,” I told him, mimicking his earlier instruction to me. “You said I shouldn’t mess with Trainees.” I gave him an innocent shrug. “You’re not hurt. I’m better with my shuriken than that. Besides, you helped.” I flicked my eyes toward the seat of his pants. “Small target and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll pay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had problems so much bigger than Rob-the-teenaged-Trainee, I found it hard to muster a care. “Will I?” I began to jog backward away from him. “I’m not the one returning to campus with a giant hole in my pants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a grand mood as I headed to Watcher Priti’s class. I passed Tracer Otto on the path and bit my lip not to smirk at the sight of his bandaged throat. Mei-Ling had stabbed the guy with her violin bow as he abducted her. I hadn’t fully believed Ronan when he told me, but the proof was right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a problem, Acari Drew?” Otto’s German accent was thick when he was angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem,” I quickly replied, darting my eyes down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting myself back under control, I kept my head down the rest of the way. I’d endured quite enough interaction with my peers for one day—there was no need to go looking for any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpeditionary Skills Training was held outside, on a stretch of sandy beach, and by the time I reached it, I’d pulled myself together. I’d handled the Masha incident. I’d investigated a murder scene and put some boneheaded boy in his place. I’d even gotten in a bit of roomie bonding. Maybe this was how normal college girls felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t yet found any clues to the actual identity of the murderer, but I’d taken the first step, and first steps felt good. First steps were empowering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a halfway decent mood for the first time in a while, but it did a nosedive when I felt him. When I saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden. Standing next to Priti on the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he looked ready to teach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER ELEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden spun his head, his eyes fixing on me the moment I stepped from the rocks onto the beach. Instant longing thrummed through me at the sight of him. The gnawing in my belly became hot fingers, twining and teasing through me enough to falter my step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked about as pleased to see me as I was to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet carried me toward him. It was stupid, but I couldn’t help myself. Like breathing, it was something I couldn’t have stopped if I wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery muscle in his body seized taut, the evidence of which was obvious—not only was he super-buff to begin with, but he wasn’t wearing a jacket over his tight white T-shirt. I’d have sworn his pecs actually cast their own shadows. It did nothing to help my addled state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSand had spilled into my sneaker, and I concentrated on the cool, damp grit. “Hi,” I said, my voice impressively calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a tight nod. “Acari.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice echoed through me, and all my hard-won calm of a moment before shattered. “I didn’t know you’d be here.” The words spilled out of me. Anger, desperation, relief—competing emotions made my voice crack. Oh God, had I really just spoken like that to a vampire in front of everyone? I quickly tried to amend it by saying, “That is, it’s a pleasure to see you again, Master McCloud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence around us seemed infinite as I felt people’s shocked stares boring into me, though it was probably only a moment that passed before Watcher Priti said, “Acari Drew, are you well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced a neutral expression. “I…Yes…I’m sorry. I have a headache, is all. I missed lunch,” I added quickly, lying to explain it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed to mollify her. She peered hard at me. “How many meals have you missed? You look pale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just the one.” I fisted my hands to stop the trembling. “But I’ve been working out more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know how important our meals are,” she said with equal concern and scold in her voice. I was a Watcher Priti favorite. She really, honestly liked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked her, too. But just then that meant nothing to me—all I was able to register was how close she was standing to Carden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was jealousy to the nth degree and it felt like madness, like acid was searing a hole through my insides. I feared the throbbing in my head would make my skull shatter. I fought to keep my face bland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Priti seemed clueless as to my sudden, overwhelming urge claw her eyes out. “I gather you met Master McCloud on your mission,” she said. “I’ve asked him to be our special guest today. He’ll be taking us rock climbing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we’re acquainted.” I smiled, sure it looked more like a teeth-baring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden’s eyes were on me, intense and unreadable, like they might peer into my soul. Was he paler than usual, too? I thought he might be. I had to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze went to the horizon, gray and vast, interrupted only by the gigantic pillars of rock that rose from the sea like chimney stacks. Here, the sea churned, black water and white froth that pummeled and roiled, powerful enough to have punched ruts into the ancient granite over the centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing reassured me: At least we weren’t going to have to go in the water. People didn’t go into this water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a reason Priti used this particular beach for her classes, and it was the same reason Ronan never surfed here. Inlets like Crispin’s Cove were protected—land cradled the water on either side, making for more manageable surf. It also meant rocky beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this bit of coastline jutted bravely into the sea, fully subjected to the punishing waves—waves that, across generations, had battered the shoreline into sand. It was the favorite spot of many teachers, and good for things like wind sprints or hand-to-hand combat while knee-high in the breakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan wouldn’t surf here. The waves were erratic and unpredictable beasts, cresting and smashing into the sea stacks. Not a great ride if you’re on a board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good afternoon, my little birds, and welcome to Expeditionary Skills Training.” Priti’s voice brought me back to reality. She always sounded so shiny, a lethal fighter with a sunny disposition. “Different missions demand different skills. As Acari Drew can tell us”—she gave me an appreciative smile that I didn’t deserve—“some missions require a facility with language or disguise. Others require no more than the simple ability to survive in the wild, and those are the skills we’ll be addressing this term. Basics like shelter, navigation, and”—she smiled brightly at Carden—“rock climbing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden took over. Or rather, he bowled me over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was used to the flirty, naughty-boy Carden. This Carden was different. This Carden was pure Vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, arms crossed at his chest and legs slightly parted, straight and solid, like an echo of the granite pillars behind him. He commanded the class, and every eye on that beach was glued to him. “In a survival situation, there are three things you need to address above all others. I call them the three H’s. Heat. H20. Hunger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget hatred.” Some Acari had said it in an attempt at humor or flirtation—I wasn’t sure which. She looked impressed with herself and her own bored superiority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden slowly swung his gaze to her, like a wolf sizing up prey. “Aye. Hatred—an easy answer. But it’s the easy answers that kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl’s face fell, her superior look replaced by a mix of contempt, resentment, and fear. In a few words, he’d turned her sass into a deficiency. Like she’d made a joke, and now we could cross her off the list because she clearly wouldn’t survive the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Carden now, I thought it miraculous that I’d found myself in his good graces. Was it only the bond? Would he have been just as disdainful with me if we didn’t have this chemical connection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hatred is easy,” he continued. “Anyone can feel it. It’s the rare person who’ll face a life-or-death situation without emotion. Without panic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, it felt like he was the one without emotion. He was utterly removed from me, more like them than he’d ever been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to get your mind right,” he said calmly, “if you’re to survive this.” He pointed to the water at his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. Were we going to go in the water after all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tuned in to the roar of the sea, a raging hum that filled my head. Its power was so great, it’d punched holes through those towering granite pillars. It had ground boulders into the sand beneath our feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes you have control over your situation. Sometimes you can find water easily. Sometimes shelter presents itself.” He began to walk around us, catching our eyes, addressing each one of us. “But sometimes you’ll have no control. Sometimes your situation will control you. Forget food or heat; sometimes all you’ll have is your will to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every one of you has faced a competitor in the ring and you were the ones who walked out alive. Facing nature is no less than that. When on a mission, you must view the outdoors as you would an opponent. See your natural surroundings as a threat. Because if you let nature catch you unawares, she will kill you as surely as any enemy.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-fever-the-watchers-3/page-13.html","bookId":2293,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM"}
