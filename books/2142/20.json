{"id":95802,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\u003cp\u003eWinter had already settled in far to the north, on the higher foothills of the Spine of the World. Cold winds brought stinging sheets of snow, often moving horizontally more than vertically. Drizzt and Innovindil kept their cowls pulled low and tight, but still the crisp snow stung their faces, and the brilliance of the snowcap had Drizzt squinting his sensitive eyes even when the sun was not brightly shining. The drow would have preferred to move after dark, but it was simply too cold, and he, Innovindil, and Sunset had to spend the dark hours huddled closely near a fire night after night. He couldn\u0027t believe how dramatically the shift in the weather had come, considering that it was still autumn back in the region of Mithral Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe going was slow - no more than a few miles a day at most, and that only if they were not trying to climb higher along the icy passes. On a few occasions, they had dared to use Sunset to fly them up over a particularly difficult ridge, but the wind was dangerously strong for even the pegasus\u0027s powerful wings. Beyond that, the last thing the pair wanted was to be spotted by Gerti and her army of behemoths!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many days have passed?\" Drizzt asked Innovindil as they sat for a break and a midday meal one gray afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tenday and six?\" the elf answered, obviously as unsure of the actual time they had spent chasing Gerti as was Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it seems as if we have walked across the seasons,\" said the drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer never comes to the mountains, and up here, autumn and spring are what we in the lower lands would call winter, to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked back to the south as Innovindil responded, and that view reminded him of just how high up they had come. The landscape opened wide before him, sloping down and spreading so completely that it appeared to flatten out below him. In viewing that, it occurred to Drizzt that if the ground was bare and less broken, he could start a round stone rolling there and it would bounce all the way to Mithral Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re getting far ahead of us,\" Drizzt remarked. \"Perhaps we should be on our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re bound for Shining White, to be sure,\" Innovindil replied. \"We will find it, do not doubt. I have seen the giant lair many times from Sunset\u0027s back.\" She motioned to the northwest, higher up in the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will we even be able to get through the passes?\" Drizzt asked, looking back up at the steel gray sky, clouds heavy with the promise of even more snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One way or another,\" she said. The drow took comfort in Innovindil\u0027s clear determination, in her scowl that seemed every bit as forceful and stoic as his own. \"They treat Sunrise lovingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frost giants appreciate beauty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs do I, Drizzt thought but did not say. Beauty, strength, and heart combined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered all of that as he looked at Innovindil, but the thought itself sent his mind rushing back to an image of another female companion he had once known. There were many similarities, Drizzt knew, but he needn\u0027t look farther than Innovindil\u0027s pointy ears and sharply angled eyebrows to remember that there were great differences, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnovindil pulled herself up from beside the low-burning fire and began collecting her pack and supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we can put some distance behind us before the snow begins,\" she said as she strapped on her sword and dagger. \"With this wind, we\u0027ll not move through the storm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt didn\u0027t reply other than a slight nod, which Innovindil was too busy to even notice. The drow just watched her going about her tasks, enjoying the flow of her body and the sweep of her long golden hair as gusts of wind blew through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of his days immediately following the fall of Shallows, when he had hidden in a cave, rolling the one-horned helm of his dead friend in his hands. The emptiness of that time assailed him again, reminding him of how far he\u0027d come. Drizzt had given in to the anger and the pain, had accepted a sense of complete hopelessness for perhaps the first time in all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnovindil and Tarathiel had brought him from that dark place, with patience and calm words and simple friendship. They had tolerated his instinctive defenses, which he\u0027d thrown up to rebuff their every advance. They had accepted his explanation of Ellifain\u0027s death without suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt Do\u0027Urden knew that he could never replace Bruenor, Catti-brie, Regis, and Wulfgar; those four were as much a part of who he was as any friend could ever hope. But maybe he didn\u0027t have to replace them. Maybe he could satisfy his emotional needs around the holes, if not filling in the holes themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the promise of Innovindil, he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move swifter,\" Kaer\u0027lic instructed in her broken command of the Dwarvish tongue. She had gleaned a few words of the language in her years on the surface, and with its many hard consonant sounds, the language bore some similarities to the drow\u0027s own, and even more to the tongue of the svirfneblin, which Kaer\u0027lic spoke fluently. To get her point across, even if her words were not correct, the drow priestess kicked poor Fender on the back, sending him stumbling ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nearly fell, but battered though he was, he was too stubborn for that. He straightened and looked back, narrowing his gray eyes under his bushy brows in a threatening scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaer\u0027lic jammed the handle of her mace into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFender hit the ground hard, coughing blood, and he spat out a tooth. He tried to scream at the priestess, but all that came through his expertly slashed throat was a wheezing and fluttering sound like a burst of wind through a row of hanging parchments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With all care,\" Tos\u0027un said to his companion. \"The more you injure him, the longer it will take for us to be away.\" As he finished, the male drow glanced back to the south, as if expecting a fiery chariot or a host of warriors to rush over him. \"We should have left the wretch with Proffit. The trolls would have eaten him and that would have been the end of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Lady Alustriel and her army would have rescued him as they overran Proffit, and wouldn\u0027t he be quick in telling them all about a pair of dark elves roaming the land?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we should have just killed him and been done with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaer\u0027lic paused and spent a moment scrutinizing her companion. She allowed her expression to show her disappointment in him, for truly, after all those years, she expected more from the warrior of House Barrison Del\u0027Armgo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould will get nothing more from him than we have already gleaned,\" Tos\u0027un said, his tone uncertain and revealing that he knew he was trying an awkward dodge. \"And we will need no barter with the orc king - he will be glad that we have returned to him, even though the news we bear will hardly be to his liking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The news of Proffit\u0027s downfall and the reclamation of Nesme will outrage him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he is smart enough to separate the message from the messenger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" said Kaer\u0027lic. \"But you presume that King Obould is still alive, and that his forces have not been scattered and overrun. Has it occurred to you that perhaps we are returning to a northland where Bruenor Battlehammer is king once more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat unsettling thought had occurred to Tos\u0027un, obviously, and he glanced past Kaer\u0027lic and kicked poor Fender as the dwarf tried to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I see Donnia again, I will slap her for leading us down this horrid road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we see Donnia and Ad\u0027non again, we will all need to find a new road to travel, I fear,\" Kaer\u0027lic replied, emphasizing that important first word. \"Or perhaps Obould continues to press and to conquer. Perhaps this is all going better than any of us ever dared hope, despite the setback along the northern banks of the Trollmoors. If Obould has secured Mithral Hall, will even Lady Alustriel find the forces to drive him out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that event more desirable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question seemed ridiculous on the surface, of course, but before Kaer\u0027lic snapped off a retort, she remembered her last encounter with the orc king. Confident, dangerously so, and imperious, he hadn\u0027t asked her and Tos\u0027un to go south with Proffit. He had ordered them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see what we shall see,\" was all the priestess replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her attention back to Fender and jerked him upright from his crouch, then sent him on his way with a rough shove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the northeast, they could see the shining top of Fourthpeak, seeming no more than a day\u0027s march.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere lay their answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith pieces of orc still hanging from the ridges of his plate mail armor, it seemed hard to take Thibbledorf Pwent very seriously. But in a confusing time of regret and despair, Bruenor Battlehammer could have found no better friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we hold the riverbank all the way down to the south, then them Felbarrans and other allies might be getting across out o\u0027 the durned giants\u0027 range,\" Pwent calmly explained to Bruenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two stood on the riverbank watching the work across the way on the eastern side, where the Felbarrans were already laying the foundation for a bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But will we be able to stretch our line?\" Bruenor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah! Won\u0027t take much,\" came the enthusiastic reply. \"Ain\u0027t seen no stupid orcs south o\u0027 here at all, and they can\u0027t be coming in from the west cause o\u0027 the mountain. Only way for them dogs to get down here is the north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words prompted both dwarves to turn and look up that way, to the mountain spur, the line of rocks sloping down to the river\u0027s edge. Many dwarves were up there, constructing a wall from the steep mountainside to the tower Wulfgar and Bruenor had taken. Their goal was to tighten the potential area of approach as much as possible so that the orc force couldn\u0027t simply swarm over them. Once that wall was set and fortified, the tower would serve as an anchor and the wall would be extended all the way to the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the time being, the ridgeline east of the tower was dotted by lookouts, and held by the Moonwood elves, their deadly bows ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never thinked I\u0027d be happy to see a bunch o\u0027 durned fairies,\" Pwent grumbled, and a much-needed grin creased Bruenor\u0027s face, a grin all the wider because of the truth of those words. Had not Nikwillig led the Moonwood elves south in force, Bruenor doubted that the dwarves would have won the day. At best, they would have been able to somehow get back inside Mithral Hall and secure the tunnels. At worst, all would have been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scope of the risk they had taken in coming out had never truly registered to King Bruenor until that moment when he had been battling at the riverbank at the southern base of the mountain arm, centering the three groupings of dwarven forces. With Wulfgar north and Pwent and the main force south, Bruenor had been struck by how tentative their position truly had been, and only then had the dwarf king come to realize how much they had gambled in coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027re the ferry plans coming along?\" he asked, needing to move on, to look forward. It had been a victory, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Them Felbarrans\u0027re planning to string the raft so it\u0027s not free floating,\" Pwent explained. \"Too much rough water south o\u0027 here to chance one getting away. We should be getting it up in two or three days. Then we can get them humans out o\u0027 the hall, and start bringing the proper stones across to start building this side o\u0027 the bridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And bring King Emerus across,\" came another voice, and the two turned to see the approach of Jackonray Broadbelt, one arm in a sling from a spear stab he\u0027d suffered in the fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emerus\u0027s coming?\" Bruenor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lost near to a thousand boys,\" Jackonray said grimly. \"No dwarf king\u0027d let that pass without consecrating the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me own priests\u0027ve already done it, and the river, too,\" Bruenor assured him. \"And the blessings of yer own and of Emerus himself will only make the road to Moradin\u0027s Halls all the easier for them brave boys that went down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye been there, so they\u0027re saying,\" said Jackonray. \"Moradin\u0027s Halls, I mean. A palace as grand as the tales, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor swallowed hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, me king looked Moradin in the eye and said, \u0027Ye send me back to kill them stinkin\u0027 orcs!\u0027 \" Pwent roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackonray nodded and grinned wide, and Bruenor let it go at that. The tales of his afterlife were flying wildly, he knew, with Cordio and the other priests shouting them and embellishing them loudest of all. But for Bruenor, there was nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the tales. Just the suppositions and the grand descriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he been at Moradin\u0027s side?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf king honestly did not know. He remembered the fight at Shallows. He remembered hearing Catti-brie\u0027s voice, as if from far, far away. He remembered a feeling of warmth and comfort, but all of it was so vague to him. The first clear image he could conjure after the disaster at Shallows had been the face of Regis, as if the halfling and his magical ruby pendant had reached right into his soul to stir him from his deep slumber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027d be missing that kind o\u0027 fun?\" Pwent was asking when Bruenor tuned back into the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized that Jackonray was hardly listening, and was instead just standing and staring at Bruenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be honored to see yer great King Emerus,\" Bruenor assured him, and he saw the Felbarran relax. \"He can say his farewells to his boys and give his honor to Nikwillig o\u0027 Felbarr, right after I\u0027m giving him the honor of Mithral Hall. \u0027Twas Nikwillig who won the day, not to doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a meeting long overdue, yerself and King Emerus,\" Jackonray agreed. \"And we\u0027ll get King Harbromm from Adbar down here soon enough. Let\u0027s see them stupid orcs stand against the three kingdoms!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill \u0027em all!\" Pwent roared, startling his two companions and drawing the attention of everyone nearby, and being dwarves, they of course took up the cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all cheering again, except for Cottie Cooperson, of course, who never even smiled anymore, let alone cheered. Word had come down the tunnels that the eastern gate was open and the way would soon be clear to ferry the refugees across the Surbrin and to the tamer lands southeast. Before winter, they would all be in Silverymoon. And from there, in the spring, they could go out, free of the dark stones of Mithral Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose cheers followed Delly Curtie as she carried Colson along the corridor from the gathering hall. Inside, she had been all smiles, offering support and shoulder pats, assuring Cottie that she\u0027d rebuild her life and maybe even have more children. She had gotten only a broken and somewhat sour look in response, for the brief moment that Cottie had lifted her teary-eyed gaze from the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut there, Delly found it hard to break any kind of a smile. In there, she supported the cheers, but outside they cut at her heart. They would all be going across the Surbrin soon, leaving her as one of only four humans in Mithral Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to keep her expression stoic when she entered her private chambers to find Wulfgar inside, pulling a blood-stained tunic over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it yer own?\" Delly asked, rushing to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held Colson tight against her hip with one arm, while her other hand played over the barbarian\u0027s muscular frame, examining him for any serious wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood of orcs,\" Wulfgar said, and he reached across and gently lifted Colson from the woman\u0027s grasp. His face lit up as he brought the toddler up high to stare into her eyes, and Colson responded with a giggle and a wriggle, and a face beaming with happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her dour mood, Delly couldn\u0027t hold back her warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s secured to the river, they\u0027re saying,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, from the mountain to the river and all along to the south. Pwent and his gang are finishing up any pockets of orcs even now. There won\u0027t likely be any living by morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027ll be floating the ferry then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar glanced away from Colson just long enough to show his curiosity at the woman\u0027s tone, and Delly knew that her voice had been a bit too eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will begin stringing the guide ropes tomorrow, yes, but I know not how long the process will take. Are the folk of the razed lands anxious to be on their way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t ye be, yerself, if Bruenor wasn\u0027t yer own father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Wulfgar turned to show her his perplexed expression. He started to nod, but just shrugged instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are no child of Bruenor,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am the wife of Wulfgar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar brought Colson down to his hip, and when the toddler whined and wriggled, he set her down to the floor and let her go. He came up straight before Delly, facing her directly, and placed his huge hands on her slender shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish to cross the river,\" he stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My place is with Wulfgar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I cannot leave,\" Wulfgar said. \"We have only begun to break free of Obould\u0027s grasp, and now that we have a way beyond Mithral Hall\u0027s doors, I must learn the fate of my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly didn\u0027t interrupt him, for she knew all of it, of course, and Wulfgar was merely reaffirming the truth of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the Surbrin east of Mithral Hall is more secure, have King Bruenor find you a place working out there, in the sun. I agree that we are not built as dwarves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The walls\u0027re closing in tight on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Wulfgar assured her, and he pulled her close. \"I know. When this is done - by summer, we hope - you and I will journey to all the cities you long to see. You will come to love Mithral Hall all the more if it is your home and not your prison.\" As he finished, he pulled her closer, wrapping his strong arms around her. He kissed her on top of her head and whispered promises that things would get better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly appreciated the words and the gestures, though in her mind, they hardly diminished the echoes of the cheers of the people who would soon be leaving the smoky dark tunnels of King Bruenor\u0027s domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t tell that to Wulfgar, though, she knew. He was trying to understand and she appreciated that. But in the end, he couldn\u0027t. His life was in Mithral Hall. His beloved friends were there.
