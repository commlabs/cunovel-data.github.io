From a group of roughly 30 people, the Black Iron Guards were completely wiped out, and Murphy was the only acolyte that survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the city lord and the Grand Knight, Viscount Jackson, was severely injured at this moment, and his life was in peril.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the source of them all was this huge Mankestre snake!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"City lord? Right, Leylin! Hurry and look at Jackson!\" Murphy slapped his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only thought of him now?\" Leylin was rather speechless, and walked around the huge snake corpse, coming to the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViscount Jackson was lying on his back on the ground and his chest was sunken in a cavity. On the corners of his lips were traces of blood, and he was in an unconscious state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin hurriedly took a look, \"3 broken ribs and the arm and leg bones are all also broken. As for the rest they are fine. With the vitality of a Grand Knight, he should be conscious in a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good! This is the only good news I\u0027ve heard all day today!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurphy walked towards that huge, lifeless snake, and said, \"This seems to be a Mankestre snake which has not yet grown to its adult stage. If it was an adult withering huge snake, it could be very likely that the water content in our bodies would have been sucked dry the very moment we entered the cave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge Mankestre snake\u0027s head fell onto the floor, and a pair of eye-shaped pearls were pierced by the pyramid shaft, and dazzling fluid flowed out from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so, the materials on this huge snake, would also be worth thousands of magic crystals!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurphy caressed the yellow-brown scales of the huge snake as he muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the other eye of the Mankestre snake opened! Its gaze, filled with hatred, immediately landed on Murphy. It opened its jaws, and the razor-sharp teeth was about to snap Murphy into two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis huge snake was not completely dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier it had feigned its death, and right now, it finally revealed its razor-sharp teeth and was about to kill this repulsive human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst such an attack, Murphy was completely not protected and he stood there stunned, not moving at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight when the snow-white teeth was about to land on Murphy, a silver chain suddenly flew out and wrapped itself on Murphy\u0027s waist, pulling him out of danger\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black arrow directly pierced the other eye of the snake, and the Mankestre snake continuously writhed and finally ceased moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Huff! Huff! Huff! *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurphy panted violently, \"Ley... Leylin, thank you! I owe you my life!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem! You gave your support to me back then too, didn\u0027t you?\" Leylin smiled as his gaze fixed on the huge snake, up until when the A.I. Chip\u0027s voice sounded, [Target has completely lost all signs of life] did he heave a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the detection of the A.I. Chip, although there were no more energy movements from the huge snake earlier, there was still a thermal response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, many kinds of creatures must be dead for a while before all thermal signs completely vanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, because of that, Leylin was even more vigilant. Besides, intentionally or accidentally, he led Murphy forward and finally verified whether the large snake was truly dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a pity! If this Mankestre snake were to die before, its other eye would have absolutely been valued over 1000 magic crystals, but right now, the value of the whole corpse is greatly reduced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was somewhat helpless at he looked to Murphy, who was at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the attack earlier- you actually did not dodge it, which makes me rather surprised!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unexpected flush reddened Murphy\u0027s cheeks, \"After using the rune shackles, my spiritual force and magic power are greatly weakened. In this period, I am just another old geezer on the street....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regards to Leylin, who saved him earlier, right now it could be said that Murphy trusted him greatly and actually even shared such a secret with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright! Let\u0027s hurry and harvest the materials of this Mankestre snake, and then return to Extreme Night City!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin sized up the chaotic scene. Leylin and the three of them had absolutely no way to move those corpses on the ground, so they could only return back to Extreme Night City and ask people to retrieve these corpses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the death of the huge Mankestre snake, this area should no longer pose a threat in future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haha... This time Leylin, your contributions have been the most, so you should be allowed to harvest the best material!\" Murphy smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcerning this matter, Leylin did not have any notions of killing Murphy and claiming all the loot for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurphy did help him earlier, and on the other hand, right now Murphy and him were the only two acolytes left, so he would definitely monopolise a large portion of the resources, thus he did not have to take a risk and kill people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the whole Mankestre snake, the most valuable ingredient would be its eyes, after which the remaining materials would only add up to a total of 1000 to 2000 magic crystals, which was not enough to bewitch Leylin yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf right now there was some rare materials worth ten thousand magic crystals, who knew if Leylin would harbour some bad intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Decent scales, combined with the snake skin, should be able to produce many sets of soft armour.\" Leylin went forward and unsheathed his cross blade, before dissecting the huge snake. Murphy too helped by his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment of being busy, Leylin and Murphy had harvested some of the more valuable portions of the huge snake. As for the remaining items, they could only be transported with help from the city lord\u0027s castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Gu Lu Lu * The axles of the carriage resounded continuously, and Viscount Jackson opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am...still alive?\" What entered his vision was a sky filled with resplendent starlight, and he felt his body rising and falling in accordance with the movements of the horse carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViscount Jackson discovered that his chest was already bandaged, and a refreshing feeling dispersed the pain, which showed that the healing process was extremely professional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was it that saved me?\" A doubt crossed Viscount Jackson\u0027s mind, and he tried hard to untangle his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"City lord! You are finally awake!\" A face with a white beard and white eyebrows appeared in front of Viscount Jackson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it? Do you still retain your memories?\" Murphy shook his finger in front of Viscount Jackson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it you who saved me? How are the others?\" Viscount Jackson struggled to speak, and his voice sounded hoarse, like a ruined bellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t me, but Leylin who saved you!\" Murphy pointed at Leylin who was driving, \"We three are the only survivors of the whole group... After exiting the woods, it took me a while to obtain this spacious horse carriage....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all dead?\" Viscount Jackson flung his head to the side and an unexplainable sorrow welled from the bottom of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Viscount! It seems like you are alright now!\" Leylin turned back, and tossed a green bottled potion, \"This is a healing potion, I hope it will be of use to you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurphy caught it, and fed it into the mouth of Viscount Jackson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter taking the potion, Viscount Jackson only felt a hot wave surging through his four limbs, and he finally regained some energy from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Towards Leylin\u0027s generosity and grace of saving my life, I will definitely repay you when we return!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If possible, please give me all of the Hove Violet Leaves in the castle. That would be the greatest recompense!\" Leylin raised his request without a tinge of restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\" Jackson was stunned, before immediately agreeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the advance of the horse carriage, the silhouette of Extreme Night City gradually appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few soldiers were still guarding the post, scrutinising the people that came and went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson looked at the distant scene, and his eyes quivered, and finally two streams of tears flowed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city lord\u0027s castle\u0027s reconnoiter group had perished completely. Even news of Viscount Jackson, as a Grand Knight, having been seriously injured had spread and immediately caused an uproar in Extreme Night City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after two days, the news did not die down. Instead, it even spread throughout the area,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the city lord of Extreme Night City, Viscount Jackson always used his status as a Grand Knight to suppress many dark factions. However, when the news of him being injured spread, it caused several ripples and undercurrents inside the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, the strength of the city castle was waning, even the few acolytes who were friendly towards Viscount Jackson had died. Jackson who was nurturing his grief had to face with all these, and was rather overwhelmed by all these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin who stayed in the villa outside the city heard some of the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, since he had returned from the venture, he always holed himself in the experiment lab, and even refused many invitations from the city lord\u0027s castle and other factions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the bright light, Leylin stared; his eyes fixated on a petri-dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the surface of the glass petri-dish, a small red lump of flesh continuously swelled, and from it grew many tentacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin picked up another pipette, and placed a drop of the yellow potion on the lump of meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Sssii! * The meat dissolved, and turned into a puddle of crimson-red with yellowish blood fluid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have finally managed to purify it, the primordial blood essence of the huge snake!\" Leylin looked at the petri-dish, as if seeing the most precious treasure in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A.I. Chip! Scan composition!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! Mission establishing, scanning in progress...]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[The list of genes has been generated, comparing to database....]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"99.8%......\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! Similarity of the blood essence with a normal huge python: 99.8%! Determined as the blood essence of original huge pythons! After remodelling in the later stage, there were new types of genes...]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip continuously reported the conclusions, and even projected the list of genes in front of Leylin\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the multicoloured image, the blood essence of the huge Mankestre snake that Leylin saw earlier was actually the same with regular huge pythons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed! This huge python is the result of an experiment by magicians!\" Leylin nodded his head. He still remembered clearly that after the A.I. Chip had scanned the huge python, it had added the words half-adult to its name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if not for the accuracy of the A.I. Chip down to the atomic level, Leylin would never unravel the secret behind it. Even other magicians would not be able to realise the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two more days, and that area should be calm again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin informed his subordinates that he was going to undergo a very long duration of experimentation and that they are not to bother him with any matters and then he secretly left the villa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-67\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-69\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-68","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
