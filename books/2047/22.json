She leaped out of bed and went into the living area, not stopping to turn on the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tommy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loft was quiet. She checked the answering machine: no messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to do this again, she thought. I can\u0027t handle another night of worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d cleaned up the mess from the police search the night before, put lemon oil on the wood, scrubbed out the sinks and the tubs, and watched cable TV until dawn. All the time she thought about what Tommy had said about sharing, about being with someone who could understand what you saw and how you felt. She wanted that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted someone who could run the night with her, someone who could hear the buildings breathe and watch the sidewalks glow with heat just after sundown. But she wanted Tommy. She wanted love. She wanted the blood-high and she wanted sex that touched her heart. She wanted excitement and she wanted security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to be part of the crowd, but she wanted to be an individual. She wanted to be human, but she wanted the strength, the senses, and the mental acuity of the vampire. She wanted it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I had a choice, she thought, if that medical student could cure me, would I go back to being human? It would mean that Tommy and I could stay together, but he would never know the feeling of being a god, and neither would I. Never again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I leave; what then? I\u0027m alone. More alone than I\u0027ve ever been. I hate being alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped pacing and went to the window. The cop from the night before was out there, sitting in a brown Dodge, watching. The other cop had followed Tommy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tommy, you jerk. Call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop would know where Tommy was. But how to get him to tell? Seduce him? Use the Vulcan nerve pinch? Sleeper hold?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should just go up there and knock on the door, Rivera thought. \"Inspector Alphonse Rivera, San Francisco PD. If you have a few minutes, I\u0027d like to talk to you about being dead. How was it? Who did it? Did it piss you off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe adjusted himself in the car seat and took a sip from his coffee. He was trying to pace his smoking. No more than four cigarettes an hour. He was in his forties now and he couldn\u0027t handle the four-pack-a-night stakeouts\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;going home with his throat raw, his lungs seared, and a vicious ache in his sinuses. He checked his watch to see if enough time had passed since he\u0027d last lit up. Almost. He rolled down the car window and something caught him by the throat, cutting off his breath. He dropped his coffee, feeling the scald in his lap as he reached in his jacket for his gun. Something caught his hand and held it like a bear trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand on his throat relaxed a bit and he sucked in a short breath. He tried to turn his head and the clamp on his throat cut off his breath again. A pretty face came through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Jody said. She loosened her grip on his throat a degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Rivera croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feel the grip on your wrist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera felt the bear trap on his wrist tighten, his hand went numb, and his whole arm lit up with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Jody said. \"I\u0027m pretty sure I can crush your windpipe before you could move, but I wanted you to be sure too. You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera tried to nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Your partner followed Tommy last night. Do you know where they are now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Rivera attempted to nod. On the seat next to him, the cell phone chirped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe released his arm, snatched the gun out of his shoulder holster, flipped off the safety, and pointed it at his head, all before he could draw a single breath. \"Take me there,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElijah Ben Sapir watched the red dots moving around on the video screen above his face. He had awakened feeling gleeful about killing the fledgling\u0027s toy boy, then he saw that his home had been invaded. He was hit with an emotion so rare it took him a while to recognize it. Fear. It had been a long time since he\u0027d been afraid. It felt good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dots on the screen were moving around on the stern of the boat, scrambling in and out of the main cabin above. Every few seconds a dot would disappear off the screen, then reappear. They were getting in and out of a raft at the stern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire reached up and flipped a series of toggle switches. The big diesels on either side of his vault roared to life. Another toggle and an electric winch began grinding in the anchor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move, move, move!\" Tommy shouted into the cabin. \"The engines started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry came through the hatch carrying a bronze statue of a ballerina. Tommy waited at the stern of the yacht with Drew. Troy Lee, Lash, Jeff, Glint, and the Emperor and his troops were already in the raft, trying to find room to move around the paintings and statues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over,\" Tommy said, taking the statue from Barry as the squat diver went over the side into the arms of the waiting Animals, almost capsizing the raft. Tommy threw the statue down to the Emperor, who caught it and went to the floor of the raft with its weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy threw a leg over the railing, and looked back. \"Light it, Drew. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew bent and held his lighter to the end of a wax-coated strip of cloth that ran across the stern deck and through the hatch to the main cabin. He watched the flame follow the trail for a few feet, then stood and joined Tommy at the rail. \"It\u0027s going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went over the rail backward and the Animals obliged them by stepping aside and letting them both hit the floor of the raft unimpeded. The raft lurched and righted itself. Tommy fought for breath to give a command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paddle, men!\" the Emperor shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Animals began to beat the water with their paddles. There was a loud clunking noise from the yacht as the transmission engaged and the raft was rocked as the twin screws engaged and began pushing the yacht away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rivera,\" Rivera said into the cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The yacht is moving,\" Cavuto said. \"I think I just aided these guys in looting it.\" He unzipped a leather case on the car seat, revealing a huge chrome-plated automatic pistol, a Desert Eagle.50-caliber. It fired bullets roughly the weight of a small dog and kicked like a jackhammer. One shot could reduce a cinder block to gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way,\" Rivera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the girl?\" Cavuto slammed a clip into the Desert Eagle, dropped another one into his jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027m at Van Ness and Lombard. I\u0027ll be there in about three minutes. Don\u0027t call in backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;oh Jesus Christ!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fucking thing just blew up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fountain of flame shot from the stern of the Sanguine II, a second passed, and the rest of the yacht disappeared in a cloud of flame that rose into the sky above her. She had cleared the breakwater and was perhaps three hundred yards out into the bay when the fuse reached Drew\u0027s incendiary cocktail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raft had just made the dock when the explosion went off. Tommy leaped onto the dock and watched the mushroom cloud dissipate. The shock wave rolled in and Tommy reached back to the raft and caught the Emperor before he went into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebris rained down around them. A pool of fire and unexploded diesel fuel spread out across the water, illuminating the whole area with a dancing bright orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a party boat, or what?\" Drew shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Animals scrambled out of the raft onto the dock and began handing up the objets d\u0027art. Tommy stood aside and watched the burn. Bummer cowered in the Emperor\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think we got him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff handed the Degas ballerina to Troy and looked over his shoulder. \"Fucking A, we got him. Nice mix, Drew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew took a bow and almost went over the edge of the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor said. \"I can\u0027t help but think that the explosion may have attracted the attention of the authorities, gentlemen. I would recommend a speedy retreat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew looked at the burning slick. \"I wish I had some acid. This would be great on acid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff jumped down into the raft and handed up the last painting, the Miro. He looked past Troy Lee, who was wrestling up the heavy frame, and said, \"Whoops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Troy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff nodded past him and the Animals turned around. Cavuto had a very large, very shiny pistol pointed at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one move!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t. The spearguns were stacked on the dock. Glint held the shotgun loosely at his side as he prayed. He dropped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it,\" Cavuto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" said Clint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true, he did,\" Tommy said. \"And before you asked. He should get extra credit for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto motioned with the pistol. \"Everybody down. On your faces. Now!\" The Animals dropped. Lazarus barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor stepped forward. \"Officer, these young men have\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now!\" Cavuto screamed. The Emperor dropped to the dock with the Animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screens went dark an instant before he was slammed against the side of the vault. He tumbled inside, feeling his flesh burn on the steel with every turn. The vault glowed red with the heat and had filled with smoke from the seared wires and the vampire\u0027s clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few seconds the tumbling stopped. The vampire was jammed into one end of the vault, his face against his knees. His skin was stinging and he tried to will it to heal, but it had been days since he had fed, so the healing came slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe located the lid by finding the smashed CRT and radar screens. Salt water sprayed in a fine mist from behind the screens. He pushed on the lid but it didn\u0027t move. He felt for the latches and released them, then heaved against the lid with force that would have crumpled a car fender, yet the lid stayed fast. The heat of the explosion had welded it shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have killed him last week, the vampire thought. This is what I get for indulging my pleasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached into the broken CRT, looking for the source of the spraying water, then concentrated his will and went to mist. The transition was slow, weak as he was, but when he had finally lost his solid form he followed the path of the water and wormed his way through the pinhole to the open ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vault lay on the bottom in a hundred and twenty feet of water and as soon as the vampire escaped, the pressure of four atmospheres condensed him to his solid shape. He tried to force himself to mist, failed, then swam toward the orange glow at the surface, thinking, The boy dies first, then a new suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke the surface in the midst of the flame slick, then scissor-kicked hard enough to bring himself completely out of the water and tried to go to mist. His limbs dissolved in the air, their vapor whipped by the flame and standing out white in the rolling black diesel smoke, but he could not hold. He fell back into the water, followed by a vortex of vapor that condensed back to solid form under water. Frustrated and angry, he began the swim around the breakwater toward the yacht club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto panned the Desert Eagle back and forth across the heads of the prostrated Animals as he moved forward to get their weapons. Lazarus growled and backed away as the big cop approached. Sirens sounded in the distance. Crew members and yacht owners were popping out of the hatches of nearby yachts like curious prairie dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside!\" Cavuto shouted, and the yachters ducked for cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto heard footsteps on the dock behind him and swung quickly around. The gate guard, looking down the cavelike barrel of the Eagle, stopped as if he\u0027d hit a force field. Cavuto swung back to cover the Animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver his shoulder Cavuto said, \"Go back to the gate and call nine-one-one. Tell them to send me some backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" the guard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, scumbags, you\u0027re under arrest. And if any of you even twitches, I\u0027ll turn you into a red stain. You have the right...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire came out of the water like a wet comet and landed on the dock behind the Animals. He was burned black and his clothes hung in sooty shreds. Cavuto fired without thinking and missed. The vampire looked up long enough to grin at him, then reached down and snatched Tommy by the back of his shirt and yanked him up like a rag doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto aimed and fired again. The second shot hit the vampire in the thigh, taking out a three-inch chuck of flesh. The vampire dropped Tommy, turned on Cavuto, and leaped. The third bullet caught the vampire in the abdomen, the impact spraying flesh and spinning him in the air like a football. He landed in a heap at Cavuto\u0027s feet. The big cop tried to back away to get another shot off, but before he could aim, the vampire snatched the gun out of his hand, taking most of the skin off his trigger finger. He leaped backward, clawing inside his jacket for his detective special as the vampire tossed the Desert Eagle over his shoulder and climbed to his feet. \"You are a dead man,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto watched the gaping wounds in the vampire\u0027s leg and stomach pulsing, bubbling, and filling with smoke. He caught the butt of his revolver just as the vampire leaped, his fingers outstretched to drive into Cavuto\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto ducked, heard a hiss and a loud thunk, and looked up, amazed that he was still alive. The vampire had stopped an inch from him. A gleaming spear through his leg had pinned him to the dock. The black kid stood a few yards away, a gas-powered speargun in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire wrenched himself around and clawed at the spear. Cavuto yanked out his gun, but with his damaged finger he ended up flinging it off the dock. He heard the sound of tires behind him, then a car coming down the dock. A second spear thunked through the vampire\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy threw the speargun aside. The Animals were all on their feet. \"Troy, throw me the sword!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy Lee picked up the fighting sword from the deck and threw it at Tommy. Tommy sidestepped; the sword whizzed by him and clattered on the dock near Cavuto, who was standing motionless, stunned at almost seeing his own death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Handle first, you doofus,\" Tommy said as he ran after the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire yanked the spear out of his shoulder and reached for the one in his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor picked up his wooden sword from the deck and charged the vampire. Lash caught him by the collar, yanking him aside as Barry fired a third spear, hitting the vampire in the hip. Jeff let go with a blast from the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire jerked with the impact of the shot and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy dived for the fighting sword at Cavuto\u0027s feet. The big cop lifted him to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" Cavuto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t kill those people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m figuring that out,\" Cavuto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brown car skidded to a stop on the dock. Tommy looked up for an instant, then turned and headed toward the vampire, who was clawing at the spear in his leg. His wounds bubbled and seethed with vapor; his body was trying to heal even as new damage was inflicted on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy raised the sword over the vampire\u0027s head and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" It was Jody\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy opened his eyes. Jody was on her knees, shielding the vampire, who had given up the struggle and was waiting for the final blow. \"No,\" Jody said. \"Don\u0027t kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy lowered the sword. Jody looked at Jeff, who still held the shotgun. \"No,\" she said. Jeff looked at Tommy, who nodded. Jeff lowered the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill the fiend, now!\" cried the Emperor, still struggling against Lash\u0027s hold on his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jody said. She pulled the spear out of the vampire\u0027s leg and he screamed. She patted his head. \"One more,\" she said quietly. She yanked the spear out of his hip and he gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody propped the vampire up on her lap. The Animals and Cavuto stood watching, not sure what to do. Clint prayed quietly, barely audible over the approaching siren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood,\" the vampire said. He looked into Jody\u0027s eyes. \"Yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me that sword, Tommy.\" Jody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and raised the sword to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" She covered the vampire with her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Jody, he\u0027s killed people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know anything, Tommy. They were all going to die anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody turned to Cavuto. \"Tell him. All the victims were terminally ill, weren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto nodded. \"The coroner said that none of them had more than a few months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy was almost in tears. \"He killed Simon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simon had AIDS, Tommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way. Not Simon. Simon was the animal of the Animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was hiding it from you guys. He was scared to death. Now, please, give me the sword.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, get out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy reared back for the killing blow. He felt a hand on his shoulder, then another one catch his sword arm and pull it down. He looked around to see the Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him go, son. The measure of a man\u0027s power is the depth of his mercy. Give me the sword. The killing is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor worked the sword out of Tommy\u0027s grip and handed it to Jody. She took it, ran the blade across her wrist, then held the wound to the vampire\u0027s mouth. He took her arm in his hands and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody looked at Cavuto. \"Your partner is handcuffed to the wheel of the car. Get him and walk away before anyone else gets here. I need the car. I don\u0027t want to be followed either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto dropped back into cop mode. \"Bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go get your partner and go. Do you want to explain this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All this.\" Jody pulled her arm out of the vampire\u0027s mouth and gestured around the dock. \"Look, the murders will stop. I promise. We\u0027re leaving and we\u0027re never coming back. So let it drop. And leave Tommy and these guys alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or what?\" Cavuto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody cradled the old vampire and lifted him as she stood up. \"Or we\u0027ll come back.\" She carried the vampire to the cruiser and put him in the back seat and crawled in with him. Rivera was sitting in the front seat. Cavuto came to the side of the car and handed his handcuff key through the window to Rivera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you,\" Rivera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto nodded. \"We\u0027re fucked, you know? We have to let them go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera unlocked the handcuffs and got out of the car. He stood next to Cavuto, not sure what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody stuck her head out the back window of the cruiser. \"Come on, Tommy, you drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy turned to the Emperor, who nodded for him to go, then to the Animals. \"You guys, get that stuff off the dock. In Troy\u0027s car. Get out of here. I\u0027ll call you at the store tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy shrugged, got in the car, and started it. \"What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the loft, Tommy. He needs a dark place to heal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not comfortable with this, Jody. I want you to know that. I\u0027d like to know what your relationship is to this guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pulled off the dock, leaving the Animals scrambling around collecting the art and the two policemen staring at them in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I love you, Tommy, but I need someone who\u0027s like me. Someone who understands. You know how that is, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you run off with the first rich older guy that comes along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the only one, Tommy.\" She stroked the vampire\u0027s burned hair. \"I don\u0027t have any choice. I hate being alone. And if he died, then I\u0027d never know about what I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you two are going away? You\u0027re leaving me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could think of some other way. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d break my heart.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1/page-22.html","bookId":2047,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:46 PM"}
