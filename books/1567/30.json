Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,\" said Luna, sounding mildly interested. \"That was noisier than I though it would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories. Luna\u0027s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna\u0027s feet appeared out of nowhere,; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. there were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she might be dead!\" he shouted with delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh look,\" whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. \"They\u0027re pleased!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah... great...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort\u0027s mind.... He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave.... He had chosen to make sure of the locker before coming...but that would not take him long....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: \"Where do Vanished objects go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno, do I? Shut it!\" snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother , Amycus, \"Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven\u0027t got Potter ¨C d\u0027you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!\" Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the stair case to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying ¨C to get¨C through this damned ¨C door!\" shouted Amycus. \"Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But isn\u0027t your sister in there\" asked Professor McGonagall. \"Didn\u0027t Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn\u0027t wake up half the castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ain\u0027t answering, you old besom! You open it! Darn! Do it, now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly, if you wish it,\" said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness, There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do Vanished objects go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into non being, which is to say, everything,\" replied Professor McGonagall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicely phrased,\" replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ve they done, the little whelps?\" he screamed. \"I\u0027ll Cruciate the lot of \u0027em till they tell me who did it ¨C and what\u0027s the Dark Lord going to say?\" he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, \"We haven\u0027t got him, and they\u0027ve gone and killed her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s only Stunned,\" said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to examine Alecto. \"She\u0027ll be perfectly all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No she bludgering well won\u0027t!\" bellowed Amycus. \"Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She\u0027s gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we\u0027ve got Potter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Got Potter\u0027?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"What do you mean, \u0027got Potter\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower! Potter belongs in my House!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We was told he might come in here!\" said Carrow. \"I dunno why, do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can push it off on the kids,\" said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty. \"Yeah, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do. We\u0027ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there\" ¨C he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories ¨C \" and we\u0027ll say they forced her to pres her Mark, and that\u0027s why he got a false alarm.... He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the difference between truth and lie, courage and cowardice,\" said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, \"a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a case of what you\u0027ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time\u0027s over. It\u0027s us what\u0027s in charge here now, and you\u0027ll back me up or you\u0027ll pay the price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he spat in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, \"Crucio!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. \"I see what Bellatrix meant,\" said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, \"you need to really mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter!\" whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. \"Potter ¨C you\u0027re here! What¨C? How¨C?\" She struggled to pull herself together. \"Potter, that was foolish!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He spat at you,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter, I ¨C that was very ¨C gallant of you ¨C but don\u0027t you realize ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I do,\" Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. \"Professor McGonagall, Voldemort\u0027s on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?\" asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. The appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it makes any difference what we call him,\" Harry told Luna. \"He already knows where I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a distant part of Harry\u0027s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat.... He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must flee,\" whispered Professor McGonagall, \"Now Potter, as quickly as you can!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" said Harry, \"There\u0027s something I need to do. Professor, so you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not ¨C hasn\u0027t it been lost for centuries?\" She sat up a little straighter \"Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to,\" said Harry. \"Professor, there\u0027s something hidden here that I\u0027m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem¨C if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sound of movement, of clinking glass. Amycus was coming round. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, \"Imperio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows\u0027 predicament. \"if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface¨C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter, are you all right.\" said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching Luna\u0027s shoulder to steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time\u0027s running out, Voldemort\u0027s getting nearer, Professor, I\u0027m acting on Dumbledore\u0027s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we\u0027ve got to get the students out while I\u0027m searching the castle ¨C It\u0027s me Voldemort wants, but he won\u0027t care about killing a few more or less, not now¨C\" not now he knows I\u0027m attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re acting on Dumbledore\u0027s orders?\" she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this ¨C this object.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly, \"we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"¨Cand if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a way,\" said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog\u0027s Head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter, we\u0027re talking about hundreds of students¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won\u0027t be interested in anyone who\u0027s Disapparating out of Hog\u0027s Head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something in that,\" she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. \"Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You\u0027d better put that Cloak back on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. the Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them. Professor McGonagall\u0027s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had descended two more floors when another set of quiet joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder\u0027s Map, but before he could take it our, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, \"Who\u0027s there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is I,\" said a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him. He had forgotten the details of Snape\u0027s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are the Carrows?\" he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was under the impression,\" said Snape, \"That Alecto had apprehended an intruder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And what gave you that impression?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape mad a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but naturally,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication, I forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have some objection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I heard a disturbance,\" said Professor McGonagall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? But all seems calm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape looked into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have. I must insist¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed. Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a touch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape¨C Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers. Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast¨C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minerva!\" said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. \"You\u0027ll do no more murder at Hogwarts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlitwick\u0027s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter. With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers. Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, \"Coward! COWARD!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happened, what\u0027s happened?\" asked Luna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He jumped,\" said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean he\u0027s dead?\" Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick\u0027s and Sprout\u0027s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s not dead,\" said McGonagall bitterly. \"Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat like shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing. Slughorn had just caught up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\" he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. \"My dear boy... what a surprise...Minerva, do please explain...Severus...what...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our headmaster is taking a short break,\" said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor!\" Harry shouted his hand on his forehead, He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort lept from it with murder in his heart¨C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor, we\u0027ve got to barricade the school, he\u0027s coming now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,\" she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped. Slughorn let out a low groan. \"Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore\u0027s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You realize , of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?\" squeaked Flitwick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can hold him up.\" said Professor Sprout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Pomona,\" said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. \"I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, \"Tentacula, Devil\u0027s Snare. And Snargaluff pods...yes, I\u0027d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can act from here,\" said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor,\" Harry said, approaching the little Charms master. \"Professor, I\u0027m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"¨CProtego Horribillis ¨C the diadem of Ravenclaw?\" squeaked Flitwick. \"A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only meant ¨C do you know where it is?

Long since lost, boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!\" said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My word,\" he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. \"What a to-do! I\u0027m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also.\" said Professor McGonagall. \"If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minerva!\" he said, aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,\" interrupted Professor McGonagall. \"Go and wake your students, Horace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter. He and Luna stayed after Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piertotum¨Coh, for heaven\u0027s sake, Filch, not now¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting \"Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re supposed to be you blithering idiot!\" shouted McGonagall. \"Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"P-Peeves?\" stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven\u0027t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now ¨C Piertotum Locomator!\" cried Professor McGonagall. And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hogwarts is threatened!\" shouted Professor McGonagall. \"Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry, some of them smaller, others larger than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Potter,\" said McGonagall. \"you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall ¨C I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Potter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry Potter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was him, I swear, I just saw him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement, Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wh¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, what\u0027s happening?\" said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voldemort\u0027s on his way, they\u0027re barricading he school ¨C Snape\u0027s run for it ¨C What are you doing here?

Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re underage!\" Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached \"I won\u0027t permit it!

Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up no the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, \"Am I too late? Has it started. I only just found out, so I ¨C I ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension. \"So¨C \u0027ow eez leetle Teddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin blinked at her, startled.

Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-30.html","bookId":1567,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:13 PM"}
