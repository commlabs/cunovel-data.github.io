I couldn\u0027t understand, couldn\u0027t make sense of what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body tried to reject the pain, and I was sucked again and again into a blackness that cut out whole seconds or maybe even minutes of the agony, making it that much harder to keep up with reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to separate them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-reality was black, and it didn\u0027t hurt so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality was red, and it felt like I was being sawed in half, hit by a bus, punched by a prize fighter, trampled by bulls, and submerged in acid, all at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality was feeling my body twist and flip when I couldn\u0027t possibly move because of the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality was knowing there was something so much more important than all this torture, and not being able to remember what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality had come on so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne moment, everything was as it should have been. Surrounded by people I loved. Smiles. Somehow, unlikely as it was, it seemed like I was about to get everything I\u0027d been fighting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then one tiny, inconsequential thing had gone wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d watched as my cup tilted, dark blood spilling out and staining the perfect white, and I\u0027d lurched toward the accident reflexively. I\u0027d seen the other, faster hands, but my body had continued to reach, to stretch___\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside me, something had yanked the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipping. Breaking. Agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness had taken over, and then washed away to a wave of torture. I couldn\u0027t breathe - I had drowned once before, and this was different; it was too hot in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePieces of me shattering, snapping, slicing apart___\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoices, this time, shouting, as the pain came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The placenta must have detached!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething sharper than knives ripped through me - the words, making sense in spite of the other tortures. Detached placenta - I knew what that meant. It meant that my baby was dying inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him out!\" I screamed to Edward. Why hadn\u0027t he done it yet? \"He can\u0027t breathe! Do it now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The morphine - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to wait, to give me painkillers, while our baby was dying?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Now - ,\" I choked, unable to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack spots covered the light in the room as a cold point of new pain stabbed icily into my stomach. It felt wrong - I struggled automatically to protect my womb, my baby, my little Edward Jacob, but I was weak. My lungs ached, oxygen burned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain faded away again, though I clung to it now. My baby, my baby, dying___\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long had passed? Seconds or minutes? The pain was gone. Numb. I couldn\u0027t feel. I still couldn\u0027t see, either, but I could hear. There was air in my lungs again, scraping in rough bubbles up and down my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay with me now, Bella! Do you hear me? Stay! You\u0027re not leaving me. Keep your heart beating!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob? Jacob, still here, still trying to save me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course,I wanted to tell him. Of course I would keep my heart beating. Hadn\u0027t I promised them both?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to feel my heart, to find it, but I was so lost inside my own body. I couldn\u0027t feel the things I should, and nothing felt in the right place. I blinked and I found my eyes. I could see the light. Not what I was looking for, but better than nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my eyes struggled to adjust, Edward whispered, \"Renesmee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenesmee?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the pale and perfect son of my imagination? I felt a moment of shock. And then a flood of warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenesmee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI willed my lips to move, willed the bubbles of air to turn into whispers on my tongue. I forced my numb hands to reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me... Give her to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light danced, shattering off Edward\u0027s crystal hands. The sparkles were tinged with red, with the blood that covered his skin. And more red in his hands. Something small and struggling, dripping with blood. He touched the warm body to my weak arms, almost like I was holding her. Her wet skin was hot\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- as hot as Jacob\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes focused; suddenly everything was absolutely clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenesmee did not cry, but she breathed in quick, startled pants. Her eyes were open, her expression so shocked it was almost funny. The little, perfectly round head was covered in a thick layer of matted, bloody curls. Her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eirises were a familiar - but astonishing - chocolate brown. Under the blood, her skin looked pale, a creamy ivory. All besides her cheeks, which flamed with color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tiny face was so absolutely perfect that it stunned me. She was even more beautiful than her father. Unbelievable. Impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Renesmee,\" I whispered. \"So... beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impossible face suddenly smiled - a wide, deliberate smile. Behind the shell-pink lips was a full complement of snowy milk teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned her head down, against my chest, burrowing against the warmth. Her skin was warm and silky, but it didn\u0027t give the way mine did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was pain again - just one warm slash of it. I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was gone. My angel-faced baby was nowhere. I couldn\u0027t see or feel her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo!I wanted to shout. Give her back to me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the weakness was too much. My arms felt like empty rubber hoses for a moment, and then they felt like nothing at all. I couldn\u0027t feel them. I couldn\u0027t feel me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackness rushed over my eyes more solidly than before. Like a thick blindfold, firm and fast. Covering not just my eyes but also my self with a crushing weight. It was exhausting to push against it. I knew it would be so much easier to give in. To let the blackness push me down, down, down to a place where there was no pain and no weariness and no worry and no fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it had only been for myself, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to struggle very long. I was only human, with no more than human strength. I\u0027d been trying to keep up with the supernatural for too long, like Jacob had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this wasn\u0027t just about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I did the easy thing now, let the black nothingness erase me, I would hurt them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward. Edward. My life and his were twisted into a single strand. Cut one, and you cut both. If he were gone, I would not be able to live through that. If I were gone, he wouldn\u0027t live through it, either. And a world without Edward seemed completely pointless. Edward had to exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob - who\u0027d said goodbye to me over and over but kept coming back when I needed him. Jacob, who I\u0027d wounded so many times it was criminal. Would I hurt him again, the worst way yet? He\u0027d stayed for me, despite everything. Now all he asked was that I stay for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was so dark here that I couldn\u0027t see either of their faces. Nothing seemed real. That made it hard not to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept pushing against the black, though, almost a reflex. I wasn\u0027t trying to lift it. I was just resisting. Not allowing it to crush me completely. I wasn\u0027t Atlas, and the black felt as heavy as a planet; I couldn\u0027t shoulder it. All I could do was not be entirely obliterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was sort of the pattern to my life - I\u0027d never been strong enough to deal with the things outside my control, to attack the enemies or outrun them. To avoid the pain. Always human and weak, the only thing I\u0027d ever been able to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo was keep going. Endure. Survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been enough up to this point. It would have to be enough today. I would endure this until help came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Edward would be doing everything he could. He would not give up. Neither would I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the blackness of nonexistence at bay by inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t enough, though - that determination. As the time ground on and on and the darkness gained by tiny eighths and sixteenths of my inches, I needed something more to draw strength from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t pull even Edward\u0027s face into view. Not Jacob\u0027s, not Alice\u0027s or Rosalie\u0027s or Charlie\u0027s or Renee\u0027s or Carlisle\u0027s or Esme\u0027s... Nothing. It terrified me, and I wondered if it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt myself slipping - there was nothing to hold on to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo!I had to survive this. Edward was depending on me. Jacob. Charlie Alice Rosalie Carlisle Renee Esme...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenesmee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, though I still couldn\u0027t see anything, suddenly I could feel something. Like phantom limbs, I imagined I could feel my arms again. And in them, something small and hard and very, very warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy baby. My little nudger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had done it. Against the odds, I had been strong enough to survive Renesmee, to hold on to her until she was strong enough to live without me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat spot of heat in my phantom arms felt so real. I clutched it closer. It was exactly where my heart should be. Holding tight the warm memory of my daughter, I knew that I would be able to fight the darkness as long as I needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warmth beside my heart got more and more real, warmer and warmer. Hotter. The heat was so real it was hard to believe that I was imagining it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHotter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncomfortable now. Too hot. Much, much too hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike grabbing the wrong end of a curling iron - my automatic response was to drop the scorching thing in my arms. But there was nothing in my arms. My arms were not curled to my chest. My arms were dead things lying somewhere at my side. The heat was inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burning grew - rose and peaked and rose again until it surpassed anything I\u0027d ever felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the pulse behind the fire raging now in my chest and realized that I\u0027d found my heart again, just in time to wish I never had. To wish that I\u0027d embraced the blackness while I\u0027d still had the chance. I wanted to raise my arms and claw my chest open and rip the heart from it - anything to get rid of this torture. But I couldn\u0027t feel my arms, couldn\u0027t move one vanished finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames, snapping my leg under his foot. That was nothing. That was a soft place to rest on a feather bed. I\u0027d take that now, a hundred times. A hundred snaps. I\u0027d take it and be grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby, kicking my ribs apart, breaking her way through me piece by piece. That was nothing. That was floating in a pool of cool water. I\u0027d take it a thousand times. Take it and be grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire blazed hotter and I wanted to scream. To beg for someone to kill me now, before I lived one more second in this pain. But I couldn\u0027t move my lips. The weight was still there, pressing on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized it wasn\u0027t the darkness holding me down; it was my body. So heavy. Burying me in the flames that were chewing their way out from my heart now, spreading with impossible pain through my shoulders and stomach, scalding their way up my throat, licking at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy couldn\u0027t I move? Why couldn\u0027t I scream? This wasn\u0027t part of the stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind was unbearably clear - sharpened by the fierce pain - and I saw the answer almost as soon as I could form the questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morphine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like a million deaths ago that we\u0027d discussed it - Edward, Carlisle, and I. Edward and Carlisle had hoped that enough painkillers would help fight the pain of the venom. Carlisle had tried with Emmett, but the venom had burned ahead of the medicine, sealing his veins. There hadn\u0027t been time for it to spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d kept my face smooth and nodded and thanked my rarely lucky stars that Edward could not read my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0027d had morphine and venom together in my system before, and I knew the truth. I knew the numbness of the medicine was completely irrelevant while the venom seared through my veins. But there\u0027d been no way I was going to mention that fact. Nothing that would make him more unwilling to change me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t guessed that the morphine would have this effect - that it would pin me down and gag me. Hold me paralyzed while I burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew all the stories. I knew that Carlisle had kept quiet enough to avoid discovery while he burned. I knew that, according to Rosalie, it did no good to scream. And I\u0027d hoped that maybe I could be like Carlisle. That I would believe Rosalie\u0027s words and keep my mouth shut. Because I knew that every scream that escaped my lips would torment Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it seemed like a hideous joke that i was getting my wish fulfilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I couldn\u0027t scream, how could I tell them to kill me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I wanted was to die. To never have been born. The whole of my existence did not outweigh this pain. Wasn\u0027t worth living through it for one more heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me die, let me die, let me die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, for a never-ending space, that was all there was. Just the fiery torture, and my soundless shrieks, pleading for death to come. Nothing else, not even time. So that made it infinite, with no beginning and no end. One infinite moment of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only change came when suddenly, impossibly, my pain was doubled. The lower half of my body, deadened since before the morphine, was suddenly on fire, too. Some broken connection had been healed - knitted together by the scorching fingers of the flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe endless burn raqed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could have been seconds or days, weeks or years, but, eventually, time came to mean something again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree things happened together, grew from each other so that I didn\u0027t know which came first: time restarted, the morphine\u0027s weight faded, and I got stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the control of my body come back to me in increments, and those increments were my first markers of the time passing. I knew it when I was able to twitch my toes and twist my fingers into fists. I knew it, but I did not act on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the fire did not decrease one tiny degree - in fact, I began to develop a new capacity for experiencing it, a new sensitivity to appreciate, separately, each blistering tongue of flame that licked through my veins - I discovered that I could think around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could remember why I shouldn\u0027t scream. I could remember the reason why I\u0027d committed to enduring this unendurable agony. I could remember that, though it felt impossible now, there was something that might be worth the torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis happened just in time for me to hold on when the weights left my body. To anyone watching me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere would be no change. But for me, as I struggled to keep the screams and thrashing locked up inside my body, where they couldn\u0027t hurt anyone else, it felt like I\u0027d gone from being tied to the stake as I burned, to gripping that stake to hold myself in the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had just enough strength to lie there unmoving while I was charred alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hearing got clearer and clearer, and I could count the frantic, pounding beats of my heart to mark the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could count the shallow breaths that gasped through my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could count the low, even breaths that came from somewhere close beside me. These moved slowest, so I concentrated on them. They meant the most time passing. More even than a clock\u0027s pendulum, those breaths pulled me through the burning seconds toward the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to get stronger, my thoughts clearer. When new noises came, I could listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were light footsteps, the whisper of air stirred by an opening door. The footsteps gotcloser, and I felt pressure against the inside of my wrist. I couldn\u0027t feel the coolness of the fingers. The fire blistered away every memory of cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still no change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightest pressure, breath against my scorched skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no scent of the morphine left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella? Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew, beyond all doubt, that if I unlocked my teeth I would lose it - I would shriek and screech and writhe and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrash. If I opened my eyes, if I so much as twitched a finger - any change at all would be the end of my control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella? Bella, love? Can you open your eyes? Can you squeeze my hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressure on my fingers. It was harder not to answer this voice, but I stayed paralyzed. I knew that the pain in his voice now was nothing compared to what it could be. Right now he only feared that I was suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe... Carlisle, maybe I was too late.\" His voice was muffled; it broke on the word late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy resolve wavered for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to her heart, Edward. It\u0027s stronger than even Emmett\u0027s was. I\u0027ve never heard anything so vital. Shell be perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I was right to keep quiet. Carlisle would reassure him. He didn\u0027t need to suffer with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And her - her spine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her injuries weren\u0027t so much worse than Esme\u0027s. The venom will heal her as it did Esme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s so still. I must have done something wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or something right, Edward. Son, you did everything I could have and more. I\u0027m not sure I would have had the persistence, the faith it took to save her. Stop berating yourself. Bella is going to be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA broken whisper. \"She must be in agony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know that. She had so much morphine in her system. We don\u0027t know the effect that will have on her experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint pressure inside the crease of my elbow. Another whisper. \"Bella, I love you. Bella, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted so much to answer him, but I wouldn\u0027t make his pain worse. Not while I had the strength to hold myself still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough all this, the racking fire went right on burning me. But there was so much space in my head now. Room to ponder their conversation, room to remember what had happened, room to look ahead to the future, with still endless room left over to suffer in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso room to worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was my baby? Why wasn\u0027t she here? Why weren\u0027t they talking about her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m staying right here,\" Edward whispered, answering an unspoken thought. \"They\u0027ll sort it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An interesting situation,\" Carlisle responded. \"And I\u0027d thought I\u0027d seen just about everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll deal with it later. We\u0027ll deal with it.\" Something pressed softly to my blistering palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure, between the five of us, we can keep it from turning into bloodshed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed. \"I don\u0027t know which side to take. I\u0027d love to flog them both. Well, later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what Bella will think - whose side she\u0027ll take,\" Carlisle mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne low, strained chuckle. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll surprise me. She always does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle\u0027s footsteps faded away again, and I was frustrated that there was no further explanation. Were they talking so mysteriously just to annoy me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to counting Edward\u0027s breaths to mark the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen thousand, nine hundred forty-three breaths later, a different set of footsteps whispered into the room. Lighter. More... rhythmic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange that I could distinguish the minute differences between footsteps that I\u0027d never been able to hear at all before today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much longer?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t be long now,\" Alice told him. \"See how clear she\u0027s becoming? I can see her so much better.\" She sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still feeling a little bitter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thanks so much for bringing it up,\" she grumbled. \"You would be mortified, too, if you realized that you were handcuffed by your own nature. I see vampires best, because I am one; I see humans okay, because I was one. But I can\u0027t see these odd half-breeds at all because they\u0027re nothing I\u0027ve experienced. Bah!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Focus, Alice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Bella\u0027s almost too easy to see now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long moment of silence, and then Edward sighed. It was a new sound, happier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s really going to be fine,\" he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t so sanguine two days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t see right two days ago. But now that she\u0027s free of all the blind spots, it\u0027s a piece of cake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you concentrate for me? On the clock - give me an estimate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice sighed. \"So impatient. Fine. Give me a sec - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuiet breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Alice.\" His voice was brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long?Couldn\u0027t they at least say it aloud for me? Was that too much to ask? How many more seconds would I burn? Ten thousand? Twenty? Another day - eighty-six thousand, four hundred? More than that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to be dazzling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward growled quietly. \"She always has been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice snorted. \"You know what I mean. Look at her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward didn\u0027t answer, but Alice\u0027s words gave me hope that maybe I didn\u0027t resemble the charcoal briquette I felt like. It seemed as if I must be just a pile of charred bones by now. Every cell in my body had been razed to ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Alice breeze out of the room. I heard the swish of the fabric she moved, rubbing against itself. I heard the quiet buzz of the light hanging from the ceiling. I heard the faint wind brushing against the outside of the house. I could hear everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, someone was watching a ball game. The Mariners were winning by two runs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my turn\" I heard Rosalie snap at someone, and there was a low snarl in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, now,\" Emmett cautioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened for more, but there was nothing but the game. Baseball was not interesting enough to distract me from the pain, so I listened to Edward\u0027s breathing again, counting the seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-one thousand, nine hundred seventeen and a half seconds later, the pain changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the good-news side of things, it started to fade from my fingertips and toes. Fading slowly, but at least it was doing something new. This had to be it. The pain was on its way out...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the bad news. The fire in my throat wasn\u0027t the same as before. I wasn\u0027t only on fire, but I was now parched, too. Dry as bone. So thirsty. Burning fire, and burning thirst...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso bad news: The fire inside my heart got hotter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was that possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heartbeat, already too fast, picked up - the fire drove its rhythm to a new frantic pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle,\" Edward called. His voice was low but clear. I knew that Carlisle would hear it, if he were in or near the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire retreated from my palms, leaving them blissfully pain-free and cool. But it retreated to my heart, which blazed hot as the sun and beat at a furious new speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle entered the room, Alice at his side. Their footsteps were so distinct, I could even tell that Carlisle was on the right, and a foot ahead of Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" Edward told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loudest sound in the room was my frenzied heart, pounding to the rhythm of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" Carlisle said. \"It\u0027s almost over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy relief at his words was overshadowed by the excruciating pain in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wrists were free, though, and my ankles. The fire was totally extinguished there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon,\" Alice agreed eagerly. \"I\u0027ll get the others. Should I have Rosalie... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes - keep the baby away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? No. No! What did he mean, keep my baby away? What was he thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers twitched - the irritation breaking through my perfect facade. The room went silent besides the jack-hammering of my heart as they all stopped breathing for a second in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand squeezed my wayward fingers. \"Bella? Bella, love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I answer him without screaming? I considered that for a moment, and then the fire ripped hotter still through my chest, draining in from my elbows and knees. Better not to chance it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Til bring them right up,\" Alice said, an urgent edge to her tone, and I heard the swish of wind as she darted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then - oh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart took off, beating like helicopter blades, the sound almost a single sustained note; it felt like it would grind through my ribs. The fire flared up in the center of my chest, sucking the last remnants of the flames from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erest of my body to fuel the most scorching blaze yet. The pain was enough to stun me, to break through my iron grip on the stake. My back arched, bowed as if the fire was dragging me upward by my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI allowed no other piece of my body to break rank as my torso slumped back to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became a battle inside me - my sprinting heart racing against the attacking fire. Both were losing. The fire was doomed, having consumed everything that was combustible; my heart galloped toward its last beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire constricted, concentrating inside that one remaining human organ with a final, unbearable surge. The surge was answered by a deep, hollow-sounding thud. My heart stuttered twice, and then thudded quietly again just once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound. No breathing. Not even mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, the absence of pain was all I could comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I opened my eyes and gazed above me in wonder. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-21.html","bookId":2026,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM"}
