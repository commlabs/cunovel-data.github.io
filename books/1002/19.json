He wore a potato-colored coat, and abrown woolpakol on his head\"Can I tell them who\u0027s here?\"Then Babi\u0027s hand was on Laila\u0027s shoulder, and he gentlypulled her from the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why don\u0027t you go upstairs, Laila. Go on.\"As she moved toward the steps, Laila heard the visitor say toBabi that he had news from Panjshir. Mammy was in theroom now too. She had one hand clamped over her mouth,and her eyes were skipping from Babi to the man in thepakolLaila peeked from the top of the stairs. She watched thestranger sit down with her parents. He leaned toward them.\n\u003cbr\u003e Said a few muted words. Then Babi\u0027s face was white, andgetting whiter, and he was looking at his hands, and Mammywas screaming, screaming, and tearing at her hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *The next morning, the day ofthefaiiha, a flock of neighborhoodwomen descended on the house and took charge ofpreparations for thekhatm dinner that would take place afterthe funeral Mammy sat on the couch the whole morning, herfingers working a handkerchief, her face bloated. She wastended to by a pair of sniffling women who took turns pattingMammy\u0027s hand gingerly, like she was the rarest and mostfragile doll in the world. Mammy did not seem aware of theirpresence.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila kneeled before her mother and took her hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mammy.\"Mammy\u0027s eyes drifted down. She blinked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll take care of her, Laila jan,\" one of the women saidwith an air of self-importance. Laila had been to funerals beforewhere she had seen women like this, women who relished allthings that had to do with death, official consolers who let noone trespass on their self-appointed duties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s under control. You go on now, girl, and do somethingelse. Leave your mother be.\"Shooed away, Laila felt useless. She bounced from one roomto the next. She puttered around the kitchen for a while. Anuncharacteristically subdued Hasina and her mother came. Sodid Giti and her mother. When Giti saw Laila, she hurriedover, threw her bony arms around her, and gave Laila a verylong, and surprisingly strong, embrace. When she pulled back,tears had pooled in her eyes. \"I am so sorry, Laila,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila thanked her. The three girls sat outside in the yard untilone of the women assigned them the task of washing glassesand stacking plates on the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e Babi too kept walking in and out of the house aimlessly,looking, it seemed, for something to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Keep him away from me.\" That was the only time Mammysaid anything all morning.\n\u003cbr\u003e Babi ended up sitting alone on a folding chair in the hallway,looking desolate and small Then one of the women told him hewas in the way there. He apologized and disappeared into hisstudy.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *That apternoon, the men went to a hall in Karteh-Seh thatBabi had rented for thefatiha. The women came to the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila took her spot beside Mammy, next to the living-roomentrance where it was customary for the family of the deceasedto sit. Mourners removed their shoes at the door, nodded atacquaintances as they crossed the room, and sat on foldingchairs arranged along the walls. Laila saw Wajma, the elderlymidwife who had delivered her. She saw Tariq\u0027s mother too,wearing a black scarf over the wig. She gave Laila a nod anda slow, sad, close-lipped smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e From a cassette player, a man\u0027s nasal voice chanted versesfrom the Koran. In between, the women sighed and shiftedand sniffled. There were muted coughs, murmurs, and,periodically, someone let out a theatrical, sorrow-drenched sob.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rasheed\u0027s wife, Mariam, came in. She was wearing ablackhijab. Strands of her hair strayed from it onto her brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e She took a seat along the wall across from Laila.\n\u003cbr\u003e Next to Laila, Mammy kept rocking back and forth. Lailadrew Mammy\u0027s hand into her lap and cradled it with both ofhers, but Mammy did not seem to notice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you want some water, Mammy?\" Laila said in her ear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you thirsty?\"But Mammy said nothing. She did nothing but sway back andforth and stare at the rug with a remote, spiritless look.\n\u003cbr\u003e Now and then, sitting next to Mammy, seeing the drooping,woebegone looks around the room, the magnitude of thedisaster that had struck her family would register with Laila.\n\u003cbr\u003e The possibilities denied. The hopes dashed.\n\u003cbr\u003e But the feeling didn\u0027t last. It was hard to feel,really feel,Mammy\u0027s loss. Hard to summon sorrow, to grieve the deathsof people Laila had never really thought of as alive in the firstplace. Ahmad and Noor had always been like lore to her. Likecharacters in a fable. Kings in a history book.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was Tariq who was real, flesh and blood. Tariq, who taughther cusswords in Pashto, who liked salted clover leaves, whofrowned and made a low, moaning sound when he chewed,who had a light pink birthmark just beneath his left collarboneshaped like an upside-down mandolin.\n\u003cbr\u003e So she sat beside Mammy and dutifully mourned Ahmad andNoor, but, in Laila\u0027s heart, her true brother was alive and well.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53238.html","bookId":1002,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:05 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:05 AM"}
