The car!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to stay awake, had to keep the car on the road. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flew open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was already off the road. The Ford had gone roving over the open prairie, where there was almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing to hit except sagebrush and tumble-weeds. It had ended up with its front bumper against a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprickly pear, bending the cactus at an impossible angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was very quiet. She looked around and found that she could see the light of Chess\u0027s house,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind her and to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine was off. Hannah turned the key in the ignition, but only got a grinding sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what? Should I get out and walk?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to concentrate on her body, to figure out how she felt. She ought to feel terrible-after all, she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elost blood and swallowed who knew what kind of poison from Thierry\u0027s veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead she only felt strangely dizzy, slightly dreamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can walk. I\u0027m fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding on to her length of dowel, she got out of the car and started toward the light. She could hardly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeel the rough ground and the bluestem grass under her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had gone about a hundred yards toward the light when she heard a wolf howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such a distinctive sound-and so incongruous. Hannah stopped in her tracks. For a wild moment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe wondered if coyotes howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was ridiculous. It was a wolf, just like the wolves that had attacked her at Paul\u0027s. And she didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave anything made of silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust keep walking, she thought. She didn\u0027t need the cool wind voice to tell her that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in her lightheaded state, she was frightened. She\u0027d seen the savagery of teeth and claws close up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the part of her that was Hana of the Three Rivers had a gut-deep fear of wild animals that the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecivilized Hannah Snow could never begin to approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped her stick in a clammy palm and kept walking grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe howl sounded again, so close that Hannah jumped inside her skin. Her eyes darted, trying to pick\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eobjects out in the darkness. She felt as if she could see better than usual at night-could the vampire blood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave done that? But even with her new vision, she couldn\u0027t spot anything moving. The world around her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas deserted and eerily quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the stars were very far away. They blazed in the sky with a cold blue light as if to show how distant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were from human affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could die here and they\u0027d go right on shining, Hannah thought. She felt very small and very\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunimportant-and very alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard a breath drawn behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny. The wolf howls had been so loud, and this was so soft... and yet it was much more terrifying. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas close-intimate. A personal sound that told her she definitely wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah whirled with her stick held ready. Her skin was crawling and she could feel a wash of acid from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher stomach, but she meant to fight for her life. She was at one with the cool wind voice; her heart was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edark and cold and steely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall figure was standing there. Starlight reflected off pale blond hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah leveled her stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter? Come back for more?\" she said, and she was pleased to find her voice steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHusky, but steady. She waved her stick at him to show what kind of \"more\" she meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Thierry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked-different from the last time she\u0027d seen him. His expression was different. His dark eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed pensive again, the sort of expression a star might have if it cared about anything that was going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon underneath it. Infinitely remote, but infinitely sad, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should you care?\" A wave of dizziness went through her. She fought it off-and saw that he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estepping toward her, hand reaching out. She whipped the stick up to the exact level of his hand, an inch\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom his palm. She was impressed with herself for how fast she did it. Her body was moving the way it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad with the werewolves, instinctively and smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose I had a life as a warrior, she mused. I think that\u0027s where the cool wind voice comes from, just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe way the crystal voice comes from Hana of the Three Rivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do care,\" Thierry said. His voice said he didn\u0027t expect her to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah laughed. The combination of her dizziness and her body instinct was having an odd effect. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efelt brashly, stupidly overconfident. Maybe this is what drunk feels like, she thought, her mind wandering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain. \"Hannah-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah made the stick whistle in the air, stopping him from coming any closer to her. \"Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said. There were tears in her eyes. \"Do you think that you can just attack me and then come back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand say I\u0027m sorry\u0027 and it\u0027s all going to be okay? Well, it isn\u0027t. If there was ever anything between us, it\u0027s all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover now. There is no second chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see his face tense. A muscle twitched in ~ his tight jaw. But the strangest thing was that she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould have sworn he had tears in his eyes, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt infuriated her. How dare he pretend to be hurt by her, after what he\u0027d done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you.\" She spat the words with a force that startled even her. \"I don\u0027t need you. I don\u0027t want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou. And I\u0027m telling you for the third time, keep the hell away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had opened his mouth as if he were about to say something, but when she got to \u0027I don\u0027t need, you,\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe suddenly shut it. When she finished, he looked away, across the shortgrass prairie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe that\u0027s best,\" he said almost inaudibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you to keep away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you to hate me.\" He looked at her again. Hannah had never seen eyes like that before. They were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimpossibly distant and shattered and still... like the peace after a war that killed everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah, I came to tell you that I am going away,\" he went on. His voice was like his eyes, bloodless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand quenched. \"I\u0027m going home. I won\u0027t bother you again. And you\u0027re right; you don\u0027t need me. You can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elive a long and happy life without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he expected her to be impressed, she wasn\u0027t. She wouldn\u0027t believe words from him anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just one thing.\" He hesitated. \"Before I go, would you let me look at you? At your neck. I want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto make sure that\"-another fleeting hesitation-\"that I didn\u0027t hurt you when I attacked you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah laughed again, a short, sharp bark of a laugh. \"How stupid do you think I am? I mean, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again and heard an edge of hysteria in it. \"If you want to do something for me, you can turn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound and go. Go away forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\" There was so much strain on his face. \"I promise. I\u0027m just worried about you getting indoors\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore you faint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can take care of myself. I don\u0027t need any help from you.\" Hannah was feeling dizzier by the minute, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe tried not to let it show. \"If you would just leave, I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, she knew she wasn\u0027t going to be fine. The gray spots were swarming in front of her eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to pass out soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I\u0027d better start for Chess\u0027s, she thought. It was insanity to turn her back on him, but it was worse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einsanity to stand here until she collapsed at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving now,\" she said, trying to sound clear and precise and unlike someone who was about to fall\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover unconscious. \"And I don\u0027t want you to follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not faint, I will not faint, she told herself grimly. She swung her stick and tried to take deep breaths\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the cool night air. But tufts of grass seemed to be trying to trip her up with every step and the entire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elandscape seemed to rock every time she looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ... will... not... faint. She knew her life depended on it. The ground seemed rubbery now, as if her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeet were sinking into it and then rebounding. And where was the light that marked Chess\u0027s house? It had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomehow gotten over to the right of her. She corrected her course and stumbled on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not faint....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then her legs simply melted. She didn\u0027t have legs. The rest of her fell slowly toward the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah managed to break her fall with her arms. Then everything was still and dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t go out completely. She was floating in darkness, feeling woozy even though she was lying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown, when she sensed someone beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she thought. Get the stick. He\u0027ll bite you; he\u0027ll kill you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t move. Her hand wouldn\u0027t obey her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a gentle hand brush her hair off her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a touch on her neck. But it was only gentle fingers, running lightly over the skin where she\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebitten tonight. They felt like a doctor\u0027s fingers, exploring to diagnose. She heard a sigh that sounded like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erelief, and then the fingers trailed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be all right.\" Thierry\u0027s voice came to her softly. She realized he didn\u0027t think she could hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she was unconscious. \"As long as you stay away from vampires for the next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that a threat? Hannah didn\u0027t understand. She braced herself for the piercing pain of teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she felt him touch her again, just his fingertips brushing her face. The touch was so immeasurably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egentle. So tender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Hannah thought. She wanted to move, to kick him away. But she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those delicate fingers were moving on, tracing her features one by one. With the lightest of touches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat sent helpless chills through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate you, Hannah thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe touch followed the curve of her eyebrow, trailed down her cheek to her birthmark. Hannah shivered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einwardly. It sketched the line of her jaw, then moved to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skin was so sensitive here. Thierry\u0027s fingers traced the outline of her lips, the join between upper and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elower. The chills became a fluttering inside Hannah. Her heart swelled with love and longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t feel this way. I hate you. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a voice was whispering in her mind, a voice she hadn\u0027t heard in what seemed like a long time. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrystal voice, soft but ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel him. Does this feel like that other one? Sense him. Does he smell the same, sound the same... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah didn\u0027t know what to make of the words and didn\u0027t want to. She just wanted Thierry to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fingers brushed over her eyelashes, thumb stroking over the fragile skin of her eyelids as if to keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem shut. Then she felt him bend closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm lips touched her forehead. Again, just the barest touch. Then they were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, Hannah,\" Thierry whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt herself lifted. She was being carried in strong gentle arms, moving swiftly and smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was harder for her to stay conscious than it had been before. She had a strange feeling of tranquillity,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof security. But she fought to open her eyes just a crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to see his hands. She didn\u0027t think there had been enough time for the pencil wound to heal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompletely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the pencil wound was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her eyes wouldn\u0027t open-not until she felt herself being lowered and placed on solid ground. Then she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emanaged to lift heavy eyelids and dart a glance at his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge burned through her-but she didn\u0027t have any strength left. She felt her eyes lapsing shut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain. Dimly, very far away, she could hear the faint echo of a doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a soft voice in her head. You don\u0027t have to be afraid anymore. I\u0027m going away-and so is she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t go. Wait. I have to talk to you. I have to ask you ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she could feel cold air all around her and she knew he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later she heard the door open, and the sound of Chess\u0027s mother gasping. She was on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClovises\u0027 doorstep. People were shaking her, talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah wasn\u0027t interested in any of it. She let the darkness take her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was when she let go completely that she began to dream. She was Hana of the Three Rivers and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas seeing the end of her own life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the bruised and bloody figure of Thierry rising up to kill his torturers. She felt it as her turn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecame. She looked up and saw his savage face, saw the animal light in his eyes. She felt her life flow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw the end of the story. The glimpse of the corridor through time, the recognition of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoulmate. The forgiveness and the promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then just shadows. But Hannah slept peacefully in the shadows until morning, unafraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing Hannah saw when she woke up was a pair of glowing green cat-eyes looking down at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel?\" Chess asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was lying in Chess\u0027s bed. Sunlight was streaming in the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... can\u0027t tell yet,\" Hannah said. Disjointed images were floating in her head, not quite forming a whole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epicture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found you last night,\" Chess said. \"You ran your dad\u0027s car off the road, but you managed to make it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere before you collapsed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... yeah. I remember.\" She did remember; the pieces of the puzzle suddenly clicked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya. Thierry. The attack. The car. Thierry again. And finally her dream. Her own voice saying, \"I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforgive you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he was gone. He\u0027d gone home, wherever home was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never felt so confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah, what happened? Are you sick? We didn\u0027t know whether to take you to a hospital last night or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat. But you didn\u0027t have a fever and you seemed to be breathing fine-so my mom said you could just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esleep a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sick.\" This was the time to tell Chess everything. After all, that was the reason she\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erunning to Chess in the first place last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now... now in the bright morning light, she didn\u0027t want to tell Chess. It wasn\u0027t just that it might put\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess in danger, either from Thierry or the Night World in general. It was that Hannah didn\u0027t need to talk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout it; she could cope on her own. It wasn\u0027t Chess\u0027s problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don\u0027t even know the truth yet, Hannah thought. But that is going to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah, are you even listening to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027m sorry. And I\u0027m okay; I felt kind of dizzy last night, but now I\u0027m better. Can I use your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ephone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to call Paul-you know, the psychologist. I need to see him, fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped up, steadied herself against a brief wave of giddiness, and walked past Chess, who was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatching her in bewilderment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Paul said. \"No, it\u0027s absolutely out of the question.\" He waved his hands, then patted his pockets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enervously, coming up empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul, please. I have to do this. And if you won\u0027t help me, I\u0027ll try it on my own. I think self-hypnosis\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshould work. I\u0027ve been doing a pretty good job of dreaming the past lately, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... too... dangerous.\" Paul said each word separately, then sank into his chair, hands at his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etemples. \"Don\u0027t you remember what happened the last time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt sorry for him. But she said ruthlessly, \"If I do it on my own, it may be even more dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight? At least if you hypnotize me you can be there to wake me up. You can throw a glass of water in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emy face again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up sharply. \"Oh, yeah? And what if it doesn\u0027t work this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah dropped her eyes. Then she raised them and looked at Paul directly. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadmitted quietly. \"But I\u0027ve still got to try. I have to know the truth. If I don\u0027t, I really think I may go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einsane.\" She didn\u0027t say it melodramatically. It was a simple statement of fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul groaned. Then he grabbed a pen and started chewing on it, glancing around the room. \"What is it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat you would want to know? Just presuming that I agreed to help you.\" His voice sounded squashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt a surge of relief. \"I want to know about this woman who keeps warning me,\" she said. \"Her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ename is Maya. And I want to know how I die in my other lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, terrific. That sounds like fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to do it.\" She took a deep breath. She wouldn\u0027t let herself look away from him, even though she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould feel the warmth as her eyes filled. \"Look, I know you don\u0027t understand. And I can\u0027t explain to you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow important it is to me. But it is ... important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence, then Paul said, \"All right. All right. But only because I think it\u0027s safer for you to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith somebody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah whispered, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she blinked and unfolded a piece of paper. \"I wrote down some questions for you to ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. Wonderful. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be getting your degree in psychology soon.\" But he took the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah walked over to the couch and got herself settled. She shut her eyes, telling her muscles to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Paul said. His voice was very slightly unsteady, but Hannah could tell he was trying to make it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoothing. \"I want you to imagine a beautiful violet light...\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-11.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
