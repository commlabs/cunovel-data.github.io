{"id":700,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER VIII IN THE ARBOUR","content":"We must go back to three o\u0027clock. At three o\u0027clock Bobby, walking in the garden smoking a cigarette, had crossed the front of the arbour—Arbour No. 1. The grass path, soundless as a Turkey carpet, did not betray his footsteps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were two people in the arbour and they were \"canoodling\"—Simon and Julia Delyse. She was keeping her hand in, perhaps, or the attraction Simon had always had for her had betrayed her into allowing him to hold her hand. Anyhow, he was holding it. Bobby looked at her, and Julia snatched her hand away. Simon laughed; he seemed to think it a good joke, and his vain soul was doubtless pleased with having got the better of Bobby with Bobby\u0027s girl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobby passed on, saying, \"I beg your pardon.\" It was the only thing he could think of to say. Then, when out of hearing, he too laughed. He had got the better of Julia. That brooding presence would brood no more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An hour later Simon, walking in the garden alone and in meditation, reached the bowling-green. He drew close to Arbour No. 2. The grass silencing his footsteps, he passed the arbour opening and looked in. The two people there did not see him for a moment, then they unlocked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was Cerise and Bobby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Simon stood, mouth open, stock still, cigar dropped on grass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had laughed when Bobby had caught him with Julia. He did not laugh now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shock of the poaching business had left him untouched, unshaken, but Cerise, in some strange way, was his centre of gravity, his compass, and sometimes his rudder. He loved Cerise; the other girls were phantoms. Perhaps Cerise was the only real thing in his mental state.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment he stood, his hand to his head like a man stunned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobby ran to him and caught him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where am I?\" said Uncle Simon. \"Oh—oh—I see.\" He leaned heavily on Bobby, looking about him in a dazed way like a man half awakened. Madame Rossignol, who had just come out of the hotel, seeing his condition, ran towards him, and Simon, as though recognising a guardian angel, held out his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Bobby and the old lady gently, very gently, began to lead him back to the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As they drew near the back entrance three men, one following the other, came out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Simon stopped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had recognised Tidd; he seemed also to recognise more fully his own position and to remember. Bobby felt his hand tightly clasping his own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, this is Mr. Tidd,\" said Simon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Pettigrew,\" said Tidd, \"where are my papers—the papers in the case of Renshaw?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tidd v. Renshaw,\" said Simon\u0027s accurate mind. \"They are in the top left-hand drawer of my bureau in Charles Street, Westminster.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53128.html","bookId":24,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:31:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:31:17 AM"}
