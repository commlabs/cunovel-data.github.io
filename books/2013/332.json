You must not speak of dragons. No dragons, do you understand?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Edur shrugged. ‘That topic had not even occurred to me-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, but in a way it has, and continues to do so. The spirit of Emurlahnis. Scabandari. Father Shadow. This haunts you, as it does all the Tiste Edur. The matter is delicate, you see. Very delicate, for both you and my guest. I must needs rely upon your restraint, or there will be trouble. Calamity, in fact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I shall do my best, sir. A moment-what is your name?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man reached for the latch. ‘My name is for no-one, Bruthen Trana. Best know me by one of my many titles. The Letherii one will do. You may call me Knuckles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the latch and pushed open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin was a vast circular chamber-far too large for the modest tower’s wall that Bruthen Trana had seen from outside. Whatever ceiling existed was lost in the gloom. The stone-tiled floor was fifty or more paces across. As Knuckles stepped inside, the glow from his lantern burgeoned, driving back the shadows. Opposite them, abutting the curved wall, was a raised dais on which heaps of silks, pillows and furs were scattered; and seated at the edge of that dais, leaning forward with forearms resting on thighs, was a giant. An ogre or some such demon, bearing the same hue of skin as Knuckles yet stretched over huge muscles and a robust frame of squat bones. The hands dangling down over the knees were disproportionately oversized even for that enormous body. Long, unkempt hair hung down to frame a heavy-featured face with deep-set eyes-so deep that even the lantern’s light could spark but a glimmer in those ridge-shelved pits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My guest,’ Knuckles murmured. ‘Kilmandaros. Most gentle, I assure you, Bruthen Trana. When… distracted. Come, she is eager to meet you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey approached, footfalls echoing in this waterless chamber. Knuckles shifted his route slightly towards a low marble table on which sat a dusty bottle of wine. ‘Beloved,’ he called to Kilmandaros, ‘see who the house has brought to us!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stuff it with food and drink and send it on its way,’ the huge woman said in a growl. ‘I am on the trail of a solution, scrawny whelp of mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana could now see, scattered on the tiles before Kilmandaros, a profusion of small bones, each incised in patterns on every available surface. They seemed arrayed without order, nothing more than rubbish spilled out from some bag, yet Kilmandaros was frowning down at them with savage concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The solution,’ she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How exciting,’ Knuckles said, procuring from somewhere a third goblet into which he poured amber wine. ‘Double or nothing, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh yes, why not? But you owe me the treasuries of a hundred thousand empires already, dear Setch-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Knuckles, my love.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Dear Knuckles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am certain it is you who owes me, Mother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For but a moment longer,’ she replied, now rubbing those huge hands together. ‘I am so close. You were a fool to offer double or nothing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, my weakness,’ Knuckles sighed as he walked over to Bruthen Trana with the goblet. Meeting the Tiste Edur’s eyes, Knuckles winked. ‘The grains run the river, Mother,’ he said. ‘Best hurry with your solution.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fist thundered on the dais. ‘Do not make me nervous!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe echoes of that impact were long in fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros leaned still further, glowering down at the array of bones. ‘The pattern,’ she whispered, ‘yes, almost there. Almost…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘1 feel magnanimous,’ Knuckles said, ‘and offer to still those grains… for a time. So that we may be true hosts to our new guest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant woman looked up, a sudden cunning in her expression. ‘Excellent idea, Knuckles. Make it so!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gesture, and the wavering light of the lantern ceased Its waver. All was still in a way Bruthen Trana could not define-after all, nothing had changed. And yet his soul knew, somehow, that the grains Knuckles had spoken of were time, its passage, its unending journey. He had just, with a single gesture of one hand, stopped time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least in this chamber. Surely not everywhere else. And yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros leaned back with a satisfied smirk and fixed her small eyes on Bruthen Trana. ‘I see,’ she said. ‘The house anticipates.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We are as flitting dreams to the Azath,’ Knuckles said. ‘Yet, even though we are but momentary conceits, as our sorry existence might well be defined, we have our uses.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-332.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
