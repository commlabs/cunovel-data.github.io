And if there was, why hadn\u0027t any of the witnesses mentioned her before? The clerk who sold the bus tickets had told him there were only seven passengers. Robert was convinced that the Hungarian carnival owner had made a mistake. It would have been easy to ignore it, to assume that it was untrue, but Robert\u0027s training would not permit it. He had been too well disciplined. Bushfekete\u0027s story had to be checked out. How? Robert thought about it. Hans Beckerman. The bus driver will know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed a call to Sunshine Tours. The office was closed. There was no listing in Kappel for a Hans Beckerman. I\u0027m going to have to go back to Switzerland and settle this, Robert thought. I can\u0027t leave any loose ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late at night when Robert arrived in Zurich. The air was cold and crisp and there was a full moon. Robert rented a car and took the now familiar drive to the little village of Kappel. He drove past the church and pulled up in front of Hans Beckerman\u0027s home, convinced that he was on a wild goose chase. The house was dark. Robert knocked on the door and waited. He knocked again, shivering in the cold night air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs Beckerman finally answered the door. She was wearing a faded flannel robe. \"Bitte?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs Beckerman, I wonder if you remember me? I\u0027m the reporter who\u0027s writing an article on Hans. I\u0027m sorry to bother you so late, but it\u0027s important that I speak to your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were greeted with silence. \"Mrs Beckerman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hans is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert felt a small shock go through him. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... I\u0027m sorry. How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His car went over the side of the mountain.\" Her voice was filled with bitterness. \"The Dummkopf Polizei said it was because he was full of drugs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drugs?\" I\u0027m sorry I cannot offer you a drink. Ulcers. The doctors cannot even give me drugs to relieve the pain. lam allergic to all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police said it was an accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they perform an autopsy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did, and they found drugs. It makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no answer. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry, Mrs Beckerman. I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed, and Robert stood there, alone in the cold night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne witness was gone. No ... two. Leslie Mothershed had died in afire. Robert stood there for a long time. Two witnesses dead. He could hear the voice of his instructor at the Farm: There\u0027s one more thing I want to discuss today. Coincidence. In our work, there is no such animal. It usually spells danger. If you keep running into the same person again and again, or if you keep spotting the same automobile when you\u0027re on the move, cover your ass. You\u0027re probably in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably in trouble. Robert was caught up in a series of conflicting emotions. What had happened had to be coincidences, and yet ... I\u0027ve got to check out the mystery passenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first call was to Fort Smith, Canada. A distraught woman\u0027s voice answered the telephone. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"William Mann, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice said, tearfully, \"I\u0027m sorry. My husband is ... is no longer with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He committed suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuicide? That hard-headed banker? What the hell is going on? Robert wondered. What he was thinking was inconceivable, and yet ... He began making one phone call after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Schmidt, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ach! The professor died in an explosion in his laboratory ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to speak to Dan Wayne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor devil. His prize stallion kicked him to death last ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laslo Bushfekete, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The carnival\u0027s closed. Laslo is dead ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fritz Mandel, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fritz was killed in a freak accident ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alarms were going full blast now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olga Romanchanko.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The poor girl. And she was so young ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m calling to check on Father Patrini.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The poor soul passed away in his sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to speak to Kevin Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kevin was murdered ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead. Every one of the witnesses dead. And he was the one who had found them and identified them. Why had he not known what was going on? Because the bastards had waited until he was out of each country before executing their victims. The only one he had reported to was General Milliard. We must not involve anyone else in this mission ... I want you to report your progress to me every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had used him to finger the witnesses. What was behind all this? Otto Schmidt had been killed in Germany, Hans Beckerman and Fritz Mandel in Switzerland. Olga Romanchanko in Russia, Dan Wayne and Kevin Parker in America, William Mann in Canada, Leslie Mothershed in England, Father Patrini in Italy, and Laslo Bushfekete in Hungary. That meant that the security agencies in more than half a dozen countries were engaged in the biggest cover-up in history. Someone at a very high level had decided that all the witnesses to the UFO crash must die. But who? And why? It was an international conspiracy and he was in the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriority: get under cover. It was hard for Robert to believe that they intended to kill him, too. He was one of them. But until he knew for certain, he could not take any chances. The first thing he had to do was to get a phony passport. That meant Ricco in Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert caught the next plane out and found himself fighting to stay awake. He had not realized how exhausted he was. The pressure of the last fifteen days, in addition to all the jet lag, had left him drained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe landed at the Leonardo da Vinci airport, and when he walked into the terminal, the first person he saw was Susan. He stopped, in shock. Her back was to him and for a moment he thought he might be mistaken. And then he heard her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I have a car picking me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert moved to her side. \"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, startled. \"Robert! What ... what a coincidence! But what a lovely surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were in Gibraltar,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled uneasily. \"Yes. We\u0027re on our way there. Monte had some business here to take care of first. We\u0027re leaving tonight. What are you doing in Rome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning for my life. \"I\u0027m finishing up on a job.\" It\u0027s my last. I\u0027ve quit, darling. We can be together from now on, and nothing will ever separate us again. Leave Monte and come back to me. But he could not bring himself to say the words. He had done enough to her. She was happy in her new life. Leave it alone, Robert thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching him. \"You look tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I\u0027ve been running around a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked into each other\u0027s eyes, and the magic was still there. The burning desire, and the memories, and the laughter, and the yearning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan took his hand in hers and said softly, \"Robert. Oh, Robert. I wish we ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that moment, a burly man in a chauffeur\u0027s uniform walked up to Susan. \"The car is ready, Mrs Banks.\" And the spell was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" She turned to Robert. \"I\u0027m sorry. I have to go now. Please take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" He watched her leave. There were so many things he wanted to say to her. Life has a lousy sense of timing. It had been wonderful seeing Susan again but what was it that was troubling him? Of course! Coincidence. Another coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a taxi to the Hassler Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome back, Commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have a bellman take up your bags.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" Robert looked at his watch. Ten p.m. He was tempted to go upstairs and get some sleep, but he had to arrange his passport first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be going to my room right away,\" Robert said. \"I would appreciate it if you would have my bags sent up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Robert turned to leave, the elevator door opened and half a dozen Shriner fraternity men came pouring out, laughing and chattering. They had obviously had a few drinks. One of them, a stout, red-faced man, waved to Robert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi there, buddy ... having a good time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" Robert said. \"Just wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert walked through the lobby to the taxi stand outside. As he started to get into the taxi, he noticed an inconspicuous grey Opel parked across the street. It was too inconspicuous. It stood out among the large, luxurious automobiles around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Via Monte Grappa,\" Robert told the taxi driver. During the drive, Robert looked out of the rear window. No grey Opel. I\u0027m getting jumpy, he thought. When they arrived at Via Monte Grappa, Robert got out at the corner. As he started to pay the driver, he saw, out of the corner of his eye, the grey Opel half a block down the street, yet he could have sworn it had not followed him. He started walking, moving away from the car, strolling slowly, stopping to look in shop windows. In the reflection of a store window, he saw the Opel, moving slowly behind him. When Robert reached the next corner, he noticed that it was a one-way street. He turned into it, going against the heavy traffic. The Opel hesitated at the corner, then sped away to pick Robert up at the other end. Robert reversed direction and walked back to Via Monte Grappa. The Opel was nowhere in sight. Robert hailed a taxi. \"Via Monticelli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building was old and unprepossessing, a relic of better days. Robert had visited it many times before, on various missions. He walked down three basement steps and knocked on the door. An eye appeared at the peephole, and a moment later the door was flung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roberto!\" a man exclaimed. He threw his arms around Robert. \"How are you, mio amico?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker was a fat man in his sixties with white, unshaven stubble, thick eyebrows, yellowed teeth and several chins. He closed the door behind him and locked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Ricco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicco had no second name. For a man like me, he liked to boast, one name is enough. Like Garbo. \"What can I do for you today, my friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m working on a case,\" Robert said, \"and I\u0027m in a hurry. Can you fix me up with a passport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicco smiled. \"Is the Pope Catholic?\" He waddled over to a cabinet in the corner and unlocked it. \"What country would you like to be from?\" He pulled out a handful of passports with different-coloured covers, and sorted through them. \"We have a Greek passport, Turkish, Yugoslavian, English ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"American,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicco pulled out a passport with a blue cover. \"Here we are. Does the name of Arthur Butterfield appeal to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ll stand over by the wall, I will take your picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert moved over to the wall. Ricco opened a drawer and took out a Polaroid camera. A minute later, Robert was looking at a picture of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t smiling,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicco looked at him, puzzled. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t smiling. Take another one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicco shrugged. \"Sure. Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert smiled while the second passport picture was taken. He looked at it and said, \"That\u0027s better.\" He casually slipped the first picture into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now comes the high-tech part,\" Ricco announced. Robert watched as Ricco walked over to a work bench where there was a laminating machine. He placed the picture on the inside of the passport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert moved to a table covered with pens, ink and other paraphernalia, and slipped a razor blade and a small bottle of glue into his jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicco was studying his handiwork. \"Not bad,\" he said. He handed the passport to Robert. \"That will be five thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And well worth it,\" Robert assured him, as he peeled off ten five-hundred-dollar bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always a pleasure doing business with you people. You know how I feel about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert knew exactly how he felt. Ricco was an expert cobbler who worked for half a dozen different governments, and was loyal to none. He put the passport in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck, Mr Butterfield.\" Ricco smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the door closed behind Robert, Ricco reached for the telephone. Information was always worth money to someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, twenty yards down the street, Robert took the new passport out of his pocket and buried it in a trash can. Chaff. The technique he had used as a pilot to lay false trails for enemy missiles. Let them look for Arthur Butterfield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grey Opel was parked half a block away. Waiting. Impossible. Robert was sure that the car was the only tail they had on him. He was certain the Opel had not followed him, and yet it kept finding him. They had to have some way of keeping track of him. There was only one answer: they were using some kind of homing device. And he had to be carrying it. Attached to his clothes? No. They had had no opportunity. Captain Dougherty had stayed with him while he packed, but he would not have known what clothes Robert would take. Robert made a mental inventory of what he was carrying ... cash, keys, a wallet, handkerchief, credit card. The credit card! I doubt if I\u0027ll need that, General. Take it. And keep it with you at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sneaky sonofabitch. No wonder they had been able to find him so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grey Opel was no longer in sight. Robert took out the card and examined it. It was slightly thicker than an ordinary credit card. By squeezing it, he could feel an inner layer. They would have a remote control to activate the card. Good, Robert thought. Let\u0027s keep the bastards busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were several trucks parked along the street, loading and unloading goods. Robert examined the licence plates. When he came to a red truck with French plates, he looked around to make sure he was not observed, and tossed the card in the back of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flagged down a taxi. \"Hassler, perfavore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the lobby, Robert approached the concierge. \"See if there\u0027s a flight out of here tonight to Paris, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly, Commander. Do you prefer any particular airline?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. The first flight out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be happy to arrange it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Robert walked over to the hotel clerk. \"My key, please. Room 314. And I\u0027ll be checking out in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Commander Bellamy.\" The clerk reached in a pigeonhole and pulled out a key and an envelope. \"There\u0027s a letter here for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert stiffened. The envelope was sealed, and addressed simply: Commander Robert Bellamy. He fingered it, feeling for plastique or any metal inside. Carefully, he opened it. Inside was a printed card advertising an Italian restaurant. It was innocent enough. Except, of course, for his name on the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you happen to remember who gave you this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the clerk said apologetically, \"but we have been so busy this evening ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not important. The man would have been faceless. He would have picked up the card somewhere, slipped it into the envelope and stood by the desk, watching to see the room number of the slot that the envelope was placed in. He would be upstairs now, in Robert\u0027s room, waiting. It was time to see the face of the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert became aware of raised voices and turned to watch the Shriners he had seen earlier, entering the lobby, laughing and singing. They had obviously had a few more drinks. The portly man said, \"Hi there, pal. You missed a great party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s mind was racing. \"You like parties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoo hoo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a real live one going on upstairs,\" Robert said. \"Booze, girls - anything you want. Just follow me, fellows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the American spirit, pal.\" The man clapped Robert on the back. \"You hear that, boys? Our friend here is throwing a party!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crowded into the elevator together and rode up to the third floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shriner said, \"These Italians sure know how to live it up. I guess they invented orgies, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to show you a real orgy,\" Robert promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed him down the hall to his room. Robert put the key in the lock and turned to the group. \"Are you all ready to have some fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a chorus of \"yeses\" ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert turned the key, pushed the door open, and stepped to one side. The room was dark. He snapped on the light. A tall, thin stranger was standing in the middle of the room with a Mauser, equipped with a silencer, half drawn. The man looked at the group with a startled expression, and quickly shoved the gun back in his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Where\u0027s the booze?\" one of the Shriners demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert pointed to the stranger. \"He has it. Go get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group surged toward the man. \"Where\u0027s the liquor, buddy? ... Where are the girls? ... Let\u0027s get this party on the road ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thin man was trying to get through to Robert, but the crowd was blocking his way. He watched helplessly as Robert bolted out of the door. He took the stairs two at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs in the lobby, Robert was moving toward the exit when the concierge called out, \"Oh, Commander Bellamy, I made your reservation for you. You are on Air France flight 312 to Paris. It leaves at one a.m.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Robert said hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was out of the door, into the small square overlooking the Spanish Steps. A taxi was discharging a passenger. Robert stepped into it. \"Via Monte Grappa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had his answer now. They intended to kill him. They\u0027re not going to find it easy. He was the hunted now instead of the hunter, but he had one big advantage. They had trained him well. He knew all their techniques, their strengths, and their weaknesses, and he intended to use that knowledge to stop them. First, he had to find a way to throw them off his trail. The men after him would have been given a story of some kind. They would have been told he was wanted for smuggling drugs, or for murder, or espionage. They would have been warned: He\u0027s dangerous. Take no chances. Shoot to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert said to the taxi driver, \"Roma Termini.\" They were hunting for him, but they would not have had enough time to disseminate his photograph. So far, he was faceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe taxi pulled up at Via Giovanni Giolitti 36, and the driver announced, \"Stazione Termini, signore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just wait here a minute.\" Robert sat in the taxi, studying the front of the railway station. There seemed to be only the usual activity. Everything appeared to be normal. Taxis and limousines were arriving and departing, discharging and picking up passengers. Porters were loading and unloading luggage. A policeman was busily ordering cars to move out of the restricted parking zone. But something was disturbing Robert. He suddenly realized what was wrong with the picture. Parked directly in front of the station, in a no-parking zone, were three unmarked sedans, with no one inside. The policeman ignored them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve changed my mind,\" Robert said to the driver. \"Via Veneto 110/A.\" It was the last place anyone would look for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American Embassy and consulate are located in a pink stucco building facing the Via Veneto, with a black wrought-iron fence in front of it. The embassy was closed at this hour, but the passport division of the consulate was open on a twenty-four-hour basis, to handle emergencies. In the foyer on the first floor, a marine sat behind a desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine looked up as Robert approached. \"May I help you, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Robert said. \"I want to inquire about getting a new passport. I lost mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you an American citizen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine indicated an office at the far end. \"They\u0027ll take care of you in there, sir. Last door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were half a dozen people in the room applying for passports, reporting lost passports, and getting renewals and visas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I need a visa to visit Albania? I have relatives there ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need this passport renewed by tonight. I have a plane to catch ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what happened to it. I must have left it in Milan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They grabbed my passport right out of my purse ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert stood there, listening. Stealing passports was a thriving cottage industry in Italy. Someone here would be getting a new passport. At the head of the line was a well-dressed, middle-aged man being handed an American passport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here is your new passport, Mr Cowan. I\u0027m sorry you had such a bad experience. I\u0027m afraid there are a lot of pickpockets in Rome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll sure see to it that they don\u0027t get hold of this one,\" Cowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do that, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert watched Cowan put the passport in his jacket pocket and turn to leave. Robert stepped ahead of him. As a woman brushed by, Robert lunged into Cowan, as though he had been pushed, almost knocking him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m terribly sorry,\" Robert apologized. He leaned over and straightened the man\u0027s jacket for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Cowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert turned and walked into the public men\u0027s room down the hall, the stranger\u0027s passport in his pocket. He looked around to make sure he was alone, then went into one of the booths. He took out the razor blade and bottle of glue he had stolen from Ricco. Very carefully, he slit the top of the plastic and removed Cowan\u0027s photograph. Next, he inserted the picture of himself that Ricco had taken. He glued the top of the plastic slot closed, and examined his handiwork. Perfect. He was now Henry Cowan. Five minutes later, he was out in the Via Veneto, getting into a taxi. \"Leonardo da Vinci.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was twelve thirty when Robert arrived at the airport. He stood outside, looking for anything unusual. On the surface, everything appeared to be normal. No police cars, no suspicious-looking men. Robert entered the terminal, and stopped just inside the door. There were various airline counters scattered around the large terminal. There seemed to be no one loitering or hiding behind posts. He stayed where he was, wary. He could not explain it, even to himself, but somehow, everything seemed too normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room was an Air France counter. You are on Air France flight 312 to Paris. It leaves at one a.m. Robert walked past the counter and approached a woman in uniform behind the Alitalia counter. \"Good evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening. Can I help you, signore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Robert said. \"Would you please page Commander Robert Bellamy to come to the courtesy telephone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly,\" she said. She picked up a microphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few feet away, a fat middle-aged woman was checking a number of suitcases, heatedly arguing with an airline attendant about overweight fees. \"In America, they never charged me for overweight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, madam. But if you wish all these bags to go on, you must pay for excess baggage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert moved closer. He heard the attendant\u0027s voice over the loudspeaker. \"Will Commander Robert Bellamy please come to the white courtesy telephone. Commander Robert Bellamy, please come to the white courtesy telephone.\" The announcement echoed throughout the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man holding a carry-on bag was walking past Robert. \"Excuse me ...\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear my wife paging me but ...\" he indicated the woman\u0027s bags, \"I can\u0027t leave my luggage.\" He pulled out a ten-dollar bill and handed it to the man. \"Would you please go over to that white telephone and tell her I\u0027ll pick her up at our hotel in an hour? I\u0027d really appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked at the ten-dollar bill in his hand. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert watched him walk over to the courtesy telephone and pick it up. He held the receiver to his ear and said, \"Hello ... hello ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next moment, four large men in black suits appeared from nowhere and closed in, pinning the hapless man to the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do this quietly,\" one of the men said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you\u0027re doing? Get your hands off me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make a fuss, Commander. There\u0027s no point ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander? You\u0027ve got the wrong man! My name is Melvyn Davis. I\u0027m from Omaha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not play games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute! I\u0027ve been set up. The man you want is over there!\" He pointed to where Robert had been standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the terminal, an airport bus was getting ready to depart. Robert boarded it, mingling with the other passengers. He sat at the back of the bus, concentrating on his next move\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was desperate to talk to Admiral Whittaker, to try to get answers about what was going on, to learn who was responsible for killing innocent people because they had witnessed something they were not supposed to have seen. Was it General Hilliard? Dustin Thornton? Or Thornton\u0027s father-in-law, Willard Stone, the man of mystery? Could he be involved in this in some way? Was it Edward Sanders, the Director of NSA? Did it go as high as the President? Robert needed answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus trip into Rome took an hour. When the bus stopped in front of the Eden Hotel, Robert disembarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to get out of the country, Robert thought. There was only one man in Rome he could trust. Colonel Francesco Cesar, head of SIFAR, the Italian Secret Service. He was going to be Robert\u0027s escape from Italy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Cesar was working late. Messages had been flashing back and forth among foreign security agencies, and they all involved Commander Robert Bellamy. Colonel Cesar had worked with Robert in the past and he was very fond of him. Cesar sighed as he looked at the latest message in front of him. Terminate. And as he was reading it, his secretary came into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander Bellamy is on line one for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Cesar stared at her. \"Bellamy? Himself? Never mind.\" He waited until the secretary left the room, then snatched up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ciao, Francesco. What the hell is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me, amico. I\u0027ve been getting all kinds of urgent communiques about you. What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" Robert said. \"And I haven\u0027t time. What have you heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027ve gone private. That you\u0027ve been turned, and are singing like a canary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you\u0027ve made a deal with the Chinese and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ. That\u0027s ridiculous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because an hour later they\u0027d be hungry for more information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Robert, this is nothing to joke about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about it, Francesco. I\u0027ve just sent ten innocent people to their deaths. I\u0027m scheduled to be number eleven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in Rome. I can\u0027t seem to get out of your fucking city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cacatura?\" There was a thoughtful silence. \"What can I do to help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me to a safe house where we can talk, and I can figure out how to get away. Can you arrange that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but you must be careful. Very careful. I will pick you up myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert breathed a deep sigh of relief. \"Thanks, Francesco. I really appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you Americans say, you owe me one. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lido bar in Trastevere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait right there. I\u0027ll see you in exactly one hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, amico.\" Robert replaced the receiver. It was going to be a long hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, two unmarked cars coasted to a stop ten yards from the Lido bar. There were four men in each car and they were all carrying automatic weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Cesar got out of the first car. \"Let\u0027s do this quickly. We don\u0027t want anyone else to get hurt. Andaente al dietro, subito.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the men silently went around to cover the back of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Bellamy watched from the rooftop of the building across the street as Cesar and his men raised their weapons and charged into the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, you bastards, Robert thought grimly, we\u0027ll play it your way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-38.html","bookId":2363,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM"}
