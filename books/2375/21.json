One more thing was swept out of her control, adding to the growing pile. Maybe she was wearing some giant galactic KICK ME sign. That would explain a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” asked Caleb, crossing the office toward her. Concern narrowed his black eyes and made her want to either punch him or beg him for a hug. She did neither, just sat there, trying to stay composed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hotel canceled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t have reservations for tonight. I didn’t want to sleep in the same place twice,” he told her in a near whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bugs. In the flurry of activity, she’d almost forgotten about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not that hotel. The hotel that agreed to host the art auction for free. They canceled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLana didn’t want to tel him that Oran had struck again. Shame burned bright in her cheeks, she knew, but she didn’t want to say it. Knowing she was embarrassed and teling him why were two different things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb took hold of her hand, his calused fingers gentle. He just held her hand, waiting for her to speak. She hated that about him—that silent patience that urged her to spil her guts better than demanding ever could. It was hopeless to try to fight him. She had to pick and choose her battles carefuly, because there just wasn’t enough energy left in her to fight them al, or to keep up with al of the lies each battle created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a friend who runs the place, which is why I managed to convince the hotel to let us use the space in exchange for free advertising. The only catch was that if anyone else wanted to book at least half the rooms in the hotel, I’d have to reschedule my event. Tomorrow was the last day before they couldn’t bump me anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But someone reserved the rooms?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not just someone. Oran.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oran? Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s throwing his engagement party the same day as the auction. Guess he figured that Brittney was a good candidate for a wife, after al. There isn’t room for both events, and Oran is wiling to pay big bucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you teling me that your ex-fiancé booked his engagement party to interfere with your auction? On purpose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLana nodded, humiliation burning her cheeks. “Probably. I didn’t fal al over myself accepting his advances the other day. This is obviously his way of punishing me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me his address and I’l have a talk with him.” The words were steady, but she heard the anger that strung them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Don’t you dare interfere. I’ve made my peace about him and that’s the end of it. Let him think he’s won some imaginary battle. I don’t care anymore. I’l figure something out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you should postpone the auction. There’s a lot happening right now, and a big public event might not be the best thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLana felt panic wel up from deep inside her. If she gave up on the auction, she’d have nothing left to work for. The foundation would crumble, and she’d have to find another reason to get out of bed in the morning. The possibility that she might not be able to find that reason was more than just scary, it terrified her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I need to do this.” She heard the desperation in her voice and wished she could hide her feelings better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb gave her a slow nod, and she could tel by the carefuly neutral expression on his face that he’d seen her panic. “Okay, so we do this. Together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no. Not that sweet voice of temptation again. She could not lean on him. He’d leave soon, and then what would she do? How would she get along on her own? It was best if she didn’t relax at al. She had so little control in her life that if she let go even a little, she’d never recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, but I’ve got it under control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb knelt down in front of her and reached out. His big hands swalowed hers, the tanned skin of his fingers dark against the paler skin of her wrists. His touch was warm. Comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it, she could not do this. She could not give in to that lure of comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me help,” he said, ducking his head so he could look into her eyes. “You have al kinds of volunteers at the youth center. I’l just be one more. What’s the harm in that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea the temptation he was, so steady and confident in the midst of her chaotic world. Al she had to do was grab a hold and let his strength add to the last dwindling reserves of her own. He was such a dangerous seduction, puling at her senses as if he’d been made just for that purpose. Everything about him appealed to her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—those sinfuly dark eyes, the way he used his size to shield rather than intimidate her, his quiet patience. The devil himself couldn’t have devised a more appealing temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t get in your way,” he said. She felt the calused pad of his thumb rasp over the back of her hand, and it sent little jolts of sensation streaking up her arms. Right to her heart. Just like the rest of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLana closed her eyes in defeat. What use was it to fight him? He’d just win in the end, anyway. She was tired of fighting. She was just plain tired in general. At least if Caleb helped her through the auction, the kids would have the funding they needed. If she had to figure out a way to live without his help when he left, then she’d do it for the kids. When he left, they’d stil need her, and she’d stil be here to help them. One way or another. She wasn’t sure what that way would be, but she’d figure it out later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. You can help, but you’re taking orders from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb gave her a grin. “Yes, ma’am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And my first order is for you to never cal me ‘ma’am’ again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb was pleased with his progress. Lana trusted him enough to let him help with her beloved foundation, which was more than he’d ever dreamed. He knew how much it meant to her, or rather, how much the kids she helped meant to her. He’d seen the way she doted on them at the youth center—the way they cheered and clung to her when she showed up. The fact that she’d alow him to help her keep that love going was enough to put a smile in his heart. He was sure now that she didn’t hate him, which was a miracle, but one he was wiling to accept with great satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb wasn’t going to let her down. He didn’t know the first thing about charity auctions, but he knew plenty about organizing men toward a common goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearly four when the bels on the office door jingled. Grant Kent came stroling in, his long-legged stride casual as a Sunday drive. Sun bounced off Grant’s blond hair, which was tousled as if he’d just gotten out of bed. Likely with some wiling woman he’d passed on his way into town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant had a way with the ladies that Caleb could only marvel at. It wasn’t just that he got a lot of women, it’s that he couldn’t seem to help it. Ladies flocked to him. It was enough to make a man question his sanity—or at least physics. There was definitely some sort of warp in the space–time–chick continuum around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLana looked up as Grant walked in, the phone plastered to her ear as it had been for the past hour. She was trying to find an alternate hotel, with little success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Caleb felt his gut tighten with jealousy. Never before had he cared that Grant was a ladies’ man, but he did now. He didn’t want Grant going anywhere near Lana with his magic dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoothly, Caleb stepped up, putting his body squarely between Grant and Lana. Or at least he thought he’d been smooth. Grant just grinned as he shook Caleb’s hand and puled him into a hard hug. “Possessive much?” asked Grant quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb puled away from the hug but held his position, blocking Lana from sight. As soon as Grant got one look at her, he’d want to pursue her and al that sweet, classic beauty. What man wouldn’t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you won’t mind if I go introduce myself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s on the phone,” said Caleb, his voice hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’l get off soon enough.” The double meaning of Grant’s words were clear, his tone teasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l cut off any body part of yours that touches her,” warned Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, so I was wrong about the possessive thing. Thanks for clearing that up.” Grant’s golden eyes were glittering with amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant went on tiptoe and leaned over to see past Caleb’s body. “She’s cute, but she looks a little stressed. Either you haven’t nailed her yet or you’re not very good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant some pointers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck off, Kent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant just laughed and puled Caleb into another man-hug. “God, I’ve missed you. You wouldn’t believe what they’ve had me doing the past few months, but I’l have to tel you later, when I’ve cleared this place. Al those extra eyes and ears make me nervous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you bring a team with you?” asked Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever was watching and listening to Lana already knew they knew about the surveilance, so there was no reason not to discuss the sweep Grant was here to do. Caleb knew better than to ask whom he’d come with when there was stil a chance that everything they said was being listened to. The men Monroe sent would not be just any soldiers. They’d be Delta Force, with plenty of secrets to keep, including their names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When wil you start the sweep?” asked Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant jerked his head toward where Lana chatted on the phone with yet another hotel, trying to find a place to hold her auction. “Depends on the woman’s constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink she can stomach watching this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb had witnessed the kind of emotions that went along with learning that a person’s privacy had been invaded. They felt violated. Betrayed. Angry and afraid. Caleb would have preferred not to subject Lana to that, but he knew the woman never backed down from a bad situation. “She’s tougher than she looks,” said Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant grunted. “Wouldn’t be hard. She looks like she’d fal over if you shouted too loud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb turned and stared at Lana, trying to see what Grant did. Sure, she wasn’t a bodybuilder or anything, but there was a quiet sort of strength about her. A steel beneath the softness that Caleb had seen with his own eyes. Maybe that was the difference. Caleb had seen Lana through the worst kind of hel a person could suffer, and she’d never given up. Grant had no idea what she was capable of, and for some reason, it gave Caleb a little spurt of satisfaction. He and Lana had a connection. Maybe not a fun one, but the kind that was born of pain and fear and survival. Even if Grant did seduce her, there was no way he’d ever be able to match that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me talk to her,” said Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wouldn’t dream of doing it any other way, buddy. I’l get the gear and be back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb nodded absently, stil staring at Lana. He loved looking at her—loved the way her shiny dark hair swung around her face, how she’d tuck a wayward lock behind her ear only to have it slip out again a second later. He loved the way her dark lashes covered her eyes when she was trying not to let him catch her watching him. He loved the sweet curve of her cheek and how a real smile would cause those twin dimples to show up out of nowhere. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-control-delta-force-2/page-21.html","bookId":2375,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:51 AM"}
