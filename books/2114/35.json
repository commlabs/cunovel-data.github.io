Not mine. Having infused breath into him, I was ready to contribute blood, but my type wasn\u0027t compatible, they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, they said I should never be a blood donor. This was bitter news, now and for the future. They said my blood had an unknown trace element that might be lethal to others. Could have been from a childhood illness. So, if the vamp boys in the group homes had succeeded in biting me, would they have gotten a case of whatever my unorthodox anonymous blood could pass on? And what about Undead Ted, the vampire newscaster whose blood had poisoned my dog, Achilles? He\u0027d sucked down a drop of my tainted blood. Had he paid a price?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had notified Hector Nightwine that Quicksilver and I were necessary guests for now. A messenger had brought over Quicksilver\u0027s dishes and food and my laptop. There was a suitcase of comfortable clothes that even matched. I suspected Godfrey\u0027s fine CinSim hand had supervised the Enchanted Cottage staff for this task and felt strangely comforted by this care package from \"home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicksilver stayed by my side, by Ric\u0027s imported hospital bed. He\u0027d lay his long nose on the hospital blanket near the foot for hours, and whine occasionally. He sensed my weariness, my despair at Ric\u0027s ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose pale blue eyes would turn my way, a sickle of white along each pupil like a waning moon, under a worry-wrinkled sky of silver fur. Dog-loyal. Keeping watch with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew his problem. The constant coming-and-going of medical personnel kept Quick from using his healing lick therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was determined to spare Ric more scars to remind him of being helpless and tormented. When the nurses took a break or changed shifts, I pulled back the covers to let Quick swipe a lick or two over Ric\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe myriad puffy red sores from the vampire tsetse fly bites were scabbing over, so this hit-and-run licking kept the nurses murmuring satisfaction that Ric \"was healing nicely,\" without alerting them to the outside help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor had been relieved that Ric didn\u0027t test positive for being \"infected\" by \"sleeping sickness\" from the fly bites, unaware that these vampire tsetse flies didn\u0027t carry any parasites to infect his system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic murmured awareness when Quicksilver braced his huge paws on the mattress edge to lave his face with warm, wet swipes. Quick\u0027s big tongue made an ideal canine washcloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, one quiet hour when we were alone, I pulled the sheets down to Ric\u0027s hips and the usual green hospital gown up to his neck. Quicksilver immediately braced his paws on the mattress again to thoroughly lave the almost solid carapace of scabs forming on Ric\u0027s abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leech marks on his groin and legs had already faded. I was relieved. I doubt Ric would have appreciated a crotch bath from Quicksilver, conscious or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic\u0027s neck was another matter and no job for Quick. The gauze bandage awkwardly taped to the spot leached Rorschach blots of blood and required changing hourly. The nurses wouldn\u0027t let me touch the dressing, nor Ric, who was drugged into a twilight state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched each clean bandage slowly darken with leaking blood and studied the resulting blot like Caressa Teagarden reading tea leaves. Once the image reminded me of the African continent. Once it looked like the profile of John Barrymore, no, Johnny Depp. Another time like a teapot. Another like a starfish. Then the wad of gauze would be changed and a fresh canvas was taped to his neck without my glimpsing the wound beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing it once had been enough. I\u0027d eyed a huge, bloody hole, not a mere double-fang gash, but a gouge. I hated to think how many vampires had supped there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my own hands as I leaned forward in the bedside chair after the nurse left, wringing them in an agony of guilt. Had the small sensual ritual of our love affair opened a road to an empire of vampires?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I, playing mock-vampire at that easily excited site, somehow extended an invitation to the unhuman? The ancient Egyptian vampires had used that small bruise, used the blood beneath the skin as a highway to Hell, playing on Ric\u0027s sleeping innocence, plundering his lifeblood bit by bit as torture, draining him to the brink of death. If I hadn\u0027t, if we hadn\u0027t, maybe...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him sleep and your conscience as well. You both need a long rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I thought it was Irma, back from going underground during the battle with the undead. I appreciated the lack of distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo such luck. I turned to see Grizelle looming behind me in her imposing human form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve returned from taking your dog out. He refuses to relieve himself here and spirit cannot conquer body forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been so hypnotized watching Ric that I\u0027d never noticed any comings and goings except as remote irritations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is a valiant warrior,\" she went on matter-of-factly, \"but even great warriors must piss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A valiant warrior?\" I wasn\u0027t surprised because I\u0027d seen Quicksilver at the attack, but I was amazed the great Grizelle would bestow any praise on me and mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a canine,\" she added with a wave of her ebony hand. The long lacquered fingernails for an instant seemed to lengthen into actual, awesome claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Quick, worried. He was giving Grizelle that mischievous canine grin that said he reveled in her grudging respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so worried about everyone and every thing I loved now, maybe because I loved only two-and one lay like a sleeping prince in a forest of metal stands and snaking plastic tubing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I carried him naked from that dungeon,\" Grizelle continued a low whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Thank you,\" I whispered back with that same sickroom intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need your thanks. You need to understand what I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His wounds, except for the throat tear, were superficial, but his back is a maze of whip welt scars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed to realize that what Ric had fought to keep secret from me was casual knowledge to this bizarre unhuman shapeshifter and Snow flunky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but he can\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are old, outer scars,\" she went on, \"but they still sear his mind. He now has new, inner scars, and they have seared his soul. You have only revived him to feel them fully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he should be dead, unfeeling, or undead, with no soul to feel anything instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve no idea what you\u0027ve done, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saved him, I hope, maybe at the cost of my own soul. I don\u0027t know yet what that demonic Brimstone Kiss did to me, and I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ll deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant, what you\u0027ve done to my master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI embraced myself to contain a shiver. I didn\u0027t know which scared me more: this intimidating goddess of a woman-cat calling Snow her \"master,\" or her hints and allegations about the state of Ric\u0027s and my mere human souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I\u0027ve done to him! Your \u0027master\u0027 has forced me to taint everything I hold most dear just to slake his own ego.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrizelle was silent for a long while. When she spoke, it was closer to a growl than a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re strong enough to wrest this man back from the Land of the Wandering Dead, you\u0027re strong enough to undo the damage you\u0027ve done. If you live long enough yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess she meant that as a pep talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had plenty of time to think, sitting there beside Ric\u0027s hospital-style bed. My discovery of the hidden vampire empire at the Karnak and its interest in raising truly \"ancient\" vamps would shake the city to its supernatural foundations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCesar Cicereau and his werewolf mob were the biggest losers. They\u0027d won the werewolf-vampire war for the city decades ago, but a powerful vampire strain had been building secretly and subterraneously all along. The Karnak was far more than a new hotel-casino on the Strip. It was a visible announcement that the vamps were back, big-time: not assimilated vamps, or pseudo vamp wannabes, or even newly evolved \"daylight\" vamps like Sansouci. These were ruthless, Old World, blood-thirsty, power-hungry vamps with ambition and access to new Millennium Revelation methods of blended science and magic to raise more of their kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy sending Sansouci and support forces to Snow, Cicereau admitted the times were changing. I could see a lot of new alliances, and contentions, arising between everyone from Snow and Cicereau to Hector Nightwine and the CinSims to Howard Hughes and everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Snow? If I could get my head around our personal wrangle, I\u0027d admit he\u0027d probably been the most up-and-coming force in pre-Karnak Vegas. In some ways he struck me as a kind of guardian, but one whose hands were tied. He hadn\u0027t played Brimstone Kiss with me as simply a sexual game, which was some comfort. It was a \"job interview\" of sorts. He was searching for a woman unsusceptible to the orgasmic kiss. I, with my virginal and murky non-sexual background, must have seemed a darned good candidate for resisting the Kiss. Which I had, but not enough to suit him, and not enough to avoid passing it on as a life-restoring force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky for Ric you agreed to the smooch, Irma said softly in the back of my mind, but we didn\u0027t totally resist the ecstasy, sister. My toes are still curling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, I told her. I\u0027m thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Ric is recovered, I had a lot of things to do, like settle what\u0027s happening with the CinSims, who violated their set boundaries to help me. And I must find Lilith. Is she a Snow kissee who failed the test too? They knew each other before I hit town. Does she know about me? Or care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Snow thinks I\u0027ve perverted the Kiss to a function it should never have had. Can I kiss just anyone back from the dead? Kinda doubt it. The emotional mojo I poured into Ric was love and desperation-driven. It came from the connection we formed inadvertently dowsing for the dead together in Sunset Park. Is Snow right? I have I doomed Ric to become some quasi-alive zombie monster?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, honey. Irma broke into my thoughts again. Even the mighty Snow can\u0027t know that for sure. How do you think he got all that long white hair? Dude\u0027s obviously a worrywart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made me laugh at last. Why borrow trouble? Ric and I would cope with whatever this second chance at life and love offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow,\" I told myself firmly in the immortal words of Scarlett O\u0027Hara, \"is another day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t be fully conscious for another day or two,\" said someone behind me what may have been minutes or hours later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my shoulders tighten even more at the sound of Snow\u0027s vibrant stage-seasoned voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t know what you\u0027ve made of him until then,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lashed myself around in the bedside chair. \"And what about what you\u0027ve made of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow wore a black velour jogging suit. He\u0027d had the forethought not to appear in the costume that would forever remind me of my humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not dead,\" he pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he is? They take his blood pressure every hour. It\u0027s low, but steady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are many ways to be dead and undead these Millennium Revelation days, Delilah. You may have invented a new one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Me? Only me? It was your supposedly potent Brimstone Kiss I may have passed on. Maybe that was all you, and nothing to do with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027d like to think \u0027love\u0027 revived him? That\u0027s why you\u0027re so angry with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s as likely as a proxy kiss from... whatever you are. Besides, I thought you didn\u0027t do men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile touched those pale lips. \"You don\u0027t know who or what I do. I just came up to see if you needed anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Less of you. If it didn\u0027t make sense to treat Ric here, I\u0027d have him out of the Inferno in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This suite has been donated to him, not for your sake. I only came to warn you that you\u0027ll need to be prepared. We have no idea what\u0027s come back in Ricardo Montoya\u0027s body. Not even Grizelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. Ric Montoya. He\u0027ll need time to mend, and more time to come to terms with that vicious torture, but I can tell you he never cracked. He never conceded anything, not his services in raising the dead, not a clue to how he did it. Nothing. Nada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow moved forward to put a hand on Quicksilver\u0027s head. The dog growled softly but never took his eyes off Ric, with rapid sideways glances to myself. If I gave the word, he\u0027d tear Snow\u0027s hand off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his guitar slashing right hand, too. I was tempted. I deserved something back for my useless exercise in self-humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one probably knows better than we do what he\u0027ll be like,\" Snow said, not moving his hand. \"But he can\u0027t speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick gave a short, sharp bark. Snow removed his right hand and lifted his left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small blindingly iridescent object was in it. A computer flash drive. He handed it to me. A peace offering? As if ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might want to stop publicly insisting on tracking down the killer of my groupie after you see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just look at the recording, Delilah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the hotel security record of the night of the murder?\" I guessed, curious at last. \"From the Dumpster area where the body was left? You kept it secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my hotel, my Dumpster, my security recording, my groupie. I didn\u0027t think the police needed to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so bad.\" I took the thumb drive, eagerly. This could exonerate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I\u0027d opened up and turned on my laptop computer on a nearby table, Snow had left as silently as he\u0027d come. He wasn\u0027t nicknamed Snow for nothing. For soft and silent snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a couple minutes to move my mind from Ric to tasks like operating a computer, but I finally clicked the drive into the proper port.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first image spotlighted the empty delivery area and the Dumpster. I fast-forwarded until I spotted a person in the frame. Two persons. I recognized my groupie, even in the dim black and white light of night. She was facing the security camera and mauling someone whose back was to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe groupie was pleading, grabbing, begging. Her hands were reaching for the other person\u0027s neck, almost as if to tear off the face, pull out the hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the shivers, remembering her clinging assault inside the Inferno after Snow had left me that evening. That crazy woman was like glue, invading my space. I saw the object of her obsession lift an arm and bat her away. The elbow caught the groupie in the forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell hard and crashed the back of her head into a metal dolly leaning against the Dumpster side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other person turned to leave, face caught by the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyself, reaching up to pin my disheveled hair back into a French twist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilith!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she really wasn\u0027t dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we are, honey, Irma said, emerging again. At least legally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how! Lilith was a murderer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat babe\u0027s gotta be taken for you, unless you can find and produce Lilith to clear yourself. You\u0027d turn her over to Homicide to face the gas chamber after going to all that trouble to find her? No way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slapped my palms hard on the desktop, until they stung, trying to feel something. Snow had admitted he kept a lot of things from me. Now I knew he kept them from the police as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about the recording bothered me, but I was too exhausted to name it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a bone thrown to a woman who\u0027d failed the Brimstone Kiss test and had almost lost her lover? Or something to hold over her head? Because, surely, he had kept the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced to the bed and Ric, my sleeping prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor had assured me the coma would lift soon. \"He\u0027s young, vigorous. It\u0027s best he \u0027sleep\u0027 while he\u0027s recovering from nearly total exsanguination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps a kiss-my newly empowered kiss-would awaken him. First, I needed to mentally purify my lips and mind and emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went over, knelt, put my hand on his cool, pale one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a chill circling my ankle. I hadn\u0027t even noticed where the silver familiar had ebbed during all the tumult. It now slithered softly up my leg and then my side and finally down my arm to become a simple braided-chain bracelet on my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic always loved me wearing silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicksilver, whimpering, laid the soft furred length of his muzzle on my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned, leaned, leaned slowly inward, until I could kiss Ric\u0027s cool, pale cheek. The dark lashes fluttered on his skin, then lifted slightly like a curtain of black snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Del. \" The word was a croak, but even with his eyes closed he knew me, knew I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe joy was overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turned at last toward mine, eyelids struggling open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I thirsted for the glimpse of recognition and recovery in those dark Spanish eyes that I loved...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I got it, my heart thumping with triumph...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly realized that one dark iris had turned bright reflective silver, like a mirror. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/brimstone-kiss-delilah-street-2/page-35.html","bookId":2114,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:35 PM"}
