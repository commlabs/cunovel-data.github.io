When they parted, he grew serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will steal it, won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will.” She looked down the street. “Just as soon as we find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a city of eight million people, it is easy enough to go unseen. Anonymity is perhaps the island of Manhattan’s greatest asset, and it came even easier for Garrett than for most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe residents of the high-rise apartment building on the Upper East Side knew only that he rose early and lived alone. He received no packages and, aside from a daughter, had no guests, and on the rare occasion that one of his neighbors might share the elevator with him either early in the morning or late at night, he would simply nod and study the newspaper that seemed perpetually tucked under one arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe neither made nor complained of noise, did not decorate for any holidays, and the children of his building didn’t even bother knocking at Halloween.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Garrett did, it seemed, was work, and in New York City, this made him not the least bit special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people at his coffee shop expected him at seven-fifteen; he bought his morning bagel promptly at half past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo all of these people (and then some), he was simply known as The Man in the Hat as he walked to and from the Hale Industries office in a gray felt fedora, rain or shine, in every month except July (during which time he wore no hat at all).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people at the coffee shop thought The Man in the Hat was some kind of throwback, an extra from a TV show, perhaps. But on this particular Friday morning, there was at least one person on the streets who knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was quietly sitting in the shadows of a café window when Garrett’s doorman greeted him, but she didn’t bother to cross and follow. Gabrielle was in place at the corner, and besides, they already knew the route. What they needed to know was the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he cut through the park, Gabrielle was a safe distance behind, and Kat was left alone to pull his trash from the dumpster and pick the lock on his mailbox. And when, twelve hours later, the man was still not home, even Kat had to admit that the day had basically come to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleaned his own apartment, collected his own dry cleaning, and his bills and financial records were done exclusively online. He neither drank nor smoked, didn’t date or socialize. According to the building’s official records, the Garrett apartment had no safe and no storage lockers. What it did have was a state-of-the-art security system and a nosy neighbor who kept her hearing aids turned up as high as they would go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing Kat knew was that she had to get into that apartment. Exactly how, however, was an entirely different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that’s why Kat was standing in the shadows of the building across the street, thinking, scheming, when a voice caught her completely off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pivoted on the sidewalk, knowing exactly who she was going to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Natalie said with a smile. “I thought that was you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Natalie, hi,” Kat told her. “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I live there.” Natalie pointed to the building Kat had been staring at for most of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” Kat said. “Small world. I was just on my way…” But Kat didn’t bother to finish, because Nat was already crossing the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanna come up?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Kat said. “I’d love to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t the first time Kat had been invited inside a place she was trying to rob. Part of her knew she should have felt guilty about the invitation, but she couldn’t quite summon the emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the elevator next to Natalie, it wasn’t hard to see her as Hale saw her. She had an easy smile and a nice laugh, and Kat could imagine her as a little girl, running with a little Hale through Hazel’s big old house. Two children bringing life to that half-dead building. That is, before Kat came and took Hale away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So…” Natalie seemed almost afraid of the question. “How is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator doors slid open and Kat followed the girl toward apartment D, acting like she’d never been in the building before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure.” Kat shrugged. “He still seems…sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Natalie put her key in the door but didn’t turn it. “Hazel was awesome. Scoot is awesome. And they seemed to be the only people in the whole family who knew that about each other. You know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kat didn’t know. Hale’s family was an enigma. She’d never met Hazel. And “Scooter” was a stranger Kat couldn’t even start to reconcile with the boy she knew. She thought about the night before, about Hale’s arms around her, the way his fingers played with her hair. And she prayed she never had to. She hoped that maybe Scooter might be gone for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh well,” Natalie said. She pushed open the door and rushed to punch out a nine-digit code on the keypad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” Kat said. “That’s a lot of numbers for a security code.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about it. My dad is totally paranoid. He’s probably got cameras watching us right now,” Natalie teased, and Kat took a surreptitious turn around the room. She didn’t see any of the usual models, but in a private residence, with so many hiding places, a person could never be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, this is a nice place,” she told the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not mine,” Nat said. “It’s my dad’s, and he’s…well…we’re looking for some new school to take me.” She stretched out on the sofa. “Do you want a drink or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so polite, Cute Kat. It’s sweet. Your mother must be very proud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s dead,” Kat blurted the words. It was so weird to talk about her mother with a stranger that she honestly didn’t know how. “I mean, she died. When I was little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Natalie said, taken aback. “Mine’s in Florida. Remarried.” She had the look of someone who thought her own mother might as well be dead but didn’t dare to say so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Kat just kept studying the room. There was a utilitarian couch and chair. There were prints on the wall by American artists, a TV ten years out of date, which Kat guessed was never used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know why you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words came quickly, like a slap. And Kat reeled with them for a moment until Natalie went on. “I don’t think you were just passing by, were you? I think you were hoping to run into me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat blushed. “I guess maybe I was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you wanted to ask me about Scooter.” Nat placed her legs on the coffee table and crossed them. When she smiled, she had a particularly devious look in her eye. “After all, I know where all the bodies are buried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie laughed a little, but Kat just thought about the folders in Natalie’s father’s office. She wondered what the folder labeled Scooter might have had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So there are bodies, are there?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie nodded. “Lots of them. Poor guy couldn’t keep a pet if his life depended on it. That rose garden has got to have at least a half dozen gerbils.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat smiled at the thought. She herself had never had a pet, unless you counted the time the Bagshaws’ father had needed her to dog-sit Queen Elizabeth’s favorite corgi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want popcorn?” Natalie asked, standing up. “I want popcorn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” Kat said, moving on to a bookshelf full of classics, eyeing every one in turn; but nothing about the books was fake. The prototype was small. Portable. Great for hiding, hard for finding. At least now that Kat had the security code she could always come back later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Butter?” Natalie called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely!” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make yourself at home,” Natalie said, and Kat did as she was told, helping herself to the bathroom, joining Nat in the kitchen, then walking back to the living room, positioning it all within the framework of everything she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett was a meticulous man, and as a result, he kept a meticulous house. In the bathroom, the towels were perfectly straight. What little food there was in the kitchen was carefully labeled. The whole apartment smelled of Windex and Lemon Pledge, and Kat could imagine that he’d spent so much of life cleaning up other people’s messes that he didn’t know when or how to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing slightly out of order was a stack of papers on the coffee table. Kat could imagine him dropping them there after work one night. Some junk mail and a takeout menu, phone bill, bank statement…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Natalie,” Kat said, reaching for it, “are you going back to Europe already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Oh that.” Natalie glanced at the passport and pushed the thought aside. “No. That’s my dad’s. Has some business trip tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s cool. Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hong Kong,” Natalie said, then crinkled her nose. “I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Kat couldn’t help herself: she peeked at the piece of paper tucked inside the small blue booklet, at the word Aviary circled in red. And the time: eight o’clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat had never felt at home in Hong Kong. Sure, she and her father had lived there for eight months after her mother died. The two of them had spent hours walking through the massive tide of people that ebbed and flowed, beating like a pulse through the city’s center. But no matter what, her mother’s memory followed them everywhere. Despite their best efforts, they were never quite able to lose her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the thought that kept pounding in her head that afternoon. Gabrielle was at her back, Hale fifty feet behind her, and the three of them stayed on the crowded sidewalk, following the man in the hat. She kept her eyes forward and her pace steady. Gabrielle split off and took the other side of the street while Kat stepped out of the way of a bicycle. She got jostled by a food vendor moving a cart full of very strange-looking oranges. But she kept the man in her sights until, finally, he turned off the busy street and into Hong Kong Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat?” Hale’s voice was in her ear. “Where is he? Did you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t lose him,” Gabrielle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is he going?” Hale asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t know.” Gabrielle sounded annoyed. “That’s why we’re following him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hale, does someone need to go back to the hotel?” Gabrielle scolded him as if he were a little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hale didn’t answer, and Kat walked deeper into the park. Concrete gave way to mossy grass. She moved from the shadow of buildings to the shadow of trees, and a cool breeze blew across her skin, carrying with it a sound that was growing louder and louder with every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that noise?” Gabrielle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, Gabs. I think…” But Kat trailed off as soon as she saw the massive net suspended within the trees and finally knew exactly what she was seeing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-18.html","bookId":2406,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM"}
