A long line snaked around the corner of the factory and led up to the Crypt. Every student in Dullsville High was standing, texting, and gossiping in line, waiting for a chance, like me, to dance in a club. I was lucky to be in Sebastian\u0027s and Luna\u0027s company so we could walk past the sea of would-be clubsters and make our way to the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sign in blood-red letters marked the entrance: CHECK ALL CELL PHONES, CAMERAS, AND MP3 PLAYERS. PHOTOGRAPHS PROHIBITED . A bouncer was checking all electronic devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we entered, Sebastian and Luna disappeared into the Crypt while I stood spellbound. Alexander stood behind me, his hands on my shoulders. A lot had changed since I\u0027d last been to the factory. The scene was truly magical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDullsville finally had a place, besides the Mansion, where I truly belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray arched columns made the once-flat ceiling appear curved. Lightning flashed against the windows, and thunder rumbled over the music as if there were a nasty storm outside the club. The center stage was magnificent. It was in the shape of a large coffin. Headstone doorways had handles resembling skeleton bones. Votives and LED torch lighting hung on the walls like a creepy tomb. The bar, too, was shaped like a giant coffin. Bottles covered in fake cobwebs were on wooden racks. The dance area was illuminated by candelabra chandeliers flickering LED lights. Two metal cages with twisted wrought iron were in the corners for dancing clubsters. Neon exit signs hung above all outgoing doors. An open coffin rested next to an erect one with signs inviting customers to step inside. For a small price, a photographer dressed as a caretaker took pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conservative students raved about the new club. Any club party with loud music was the chance to let loose and be away from nagging parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow!\" I said. \"This is what I\u0027ve always dreamed of.\" I found Scarlet and Onyx already dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Alexander and Sebastian tried to find Jagger, I jumped onto the dance floor and rocked with my vampire friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed Luna, off in the corner, waiting for Sebastian to return. She was a misfit, even in her brother\u0027s club. Aloof and unfettered, she just observed the goings-on around her. Scarlet and I ran over to her and dragged her onto the dance floor with us. It was as if she was relieved, finally having some friends of her own to hang out with. It wasn\u0027t long before her pink hair was tossing back and forth as we all danced to the morbid music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhausted, I took a break. It was then I caught sight of the curious door - only tonight it was adorned like a grave marker and had a skeleton-bone handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where Jagger is?\" I asked Scarlet when we headed off to the bar. \"I want to try that door again and I don\u0027t want him to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" She tried to shout over the music. \"That tombstone door. We still don\u0027t know what it leads to. This could all be a ruse for something nefarious underground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can check it out,\" she said, uninterested. \"I want to dance. I think I see Trevor.\" She slipped into the crowd while Luna and Onyx continued to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way through wall-to-wall clubsters until I reached the grave marker door. There was so much going on, I was sure no one would notice me trying to sneak in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had put the key in and turned the lock when someone grabbed my hand. \"Time to dance,\" Trevor said. Before I could shake free I was back on the dance floor, staring at Trevor Mitchell. Where were Alexander, Sebastian, and Jagger to protect me? I stood motionless, with my arms folded. \"You can move better than that,\" he said. He put his hands on my waist and shook my hips back and forth. \"Get off!\" I said. \"The dance doesn\u0027t start until you do!\" he said. Then I thought, What difference does it make? I was as close to Trevor as I was to anyone else on the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the song take over me and I danced my heart out. All at once I was lost, dancing with Trevor. His green eyes burned through me as if we were the only two on the dance floor. He put his hand around my waist and drew me to him, so close our bodies touched. I could feel his rock-hard stomach against mine. He stared at me intently and a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmile crept across his face. I was in his clutches. I knew any moment Trevor was going to kiss me. Suddenly Alexander was standing next to Trevor. There was no denying Alexander was ready to take him off the dance floor - physically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. I pulled Alexander close. \"That dance is over now. The rest are saved for you.\" Trevor watched me as I snuggled with Alexander. I checked back and Trevor was dancing with a group of girls, as if I didn\u0027t exist anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning I stumbled into the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee. My mom caught sight of my ring. \"That\u0027s gorgeous. Where did you get it?\" \"Alexander gave it to me.\" \"Sweetheart - that\u0027s real.\" \"I know. Can you believe this? I don\u0027t deserve something this beautiful.\" \"Maybe you\u0027re too young to get a gift like that,\" she said with a crinkle in her brow. \"I just turned seventeen! And Alexander\u0027s eighteen. Too young?\" \"I didn\u0027t mean it like that.\" \"I\u0027m sorry I snapped.\" \"Did he ask you anything when he gave it to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like getting down on one knee?\" I asked, slightly horrified at her overreaction to my good news. \"No, he didn\u0027t. Why does everyone have to take this as more than it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was this freaked out about a ring, I couldn\u0027t imagine what she\u0027d say if I told her I wanted to turn into a vampire - for real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should talk,\" my mom said. \"About the birds and bees? I think we\u0027ve been over that.\" \"No, about your future. College. Getting out of town. Alexander.\" \"What, now you don\u0027t approve of him?\" \"Of course I do. I think he\u0027s been amazing for you. I just hope you\u0027ll go to college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You met dad at college. It\u0027s not my fault that I met my true love in high school. Besides, can\u0027t I just enjoy my birthday present?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want you to make sure you are as focused on school as much as you are on relationships.\" \"Well, you know I have never been focused on school.\" We both had a small chuckle. \"If Alexander decides to study in Romania, I\u0027m up for it,\" I assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shouldn\u0027t be about what Alexander wants. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to talk to you about.\" \"Have I ever done anything in my life I didn\u0027t want to do?\" I asked candidly. \"Uh . . . no. I wish you had - it would have made my life a lot easier.\" \"Have I ever succumbed to peer pressure?\" I asked. \"No. You are the antithesis of that.\" \"Then why can\u0027t you trust me?\" \"Because I know what love does. It makes you think things - that the world is more romantic than it is.\" \"Is that so bad? You have Dad, this house, and Billy and me.\" \"You are right, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been pretty miserable most of my life. For almost a year now, I\u0027ve really enjoyed this town. I have a great boyfriend and I\u0027ve met a lot of people that I connect with. I haven\u0027t gotten into trouble and my grades have been pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was always hoping you\u0027d be able to graduate and find a passion beyond . . .\" \"Vampires?\" \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go to college, Mom. I want to be an editor for a fashion mag. You think Alexander would go out with me if I were just a slacker? He has standards, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Alexander is an amazing guy.\" \"I want to show you something,\" I said. She followed me to my bedroom and I took out the bracelet buried in my drawer from Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This could be my future,\" I said. \"Where did you get this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trevor Mitchell.\" \"Trevor? That is unexpected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know . . . so when you worry about my future, you can think about this one, too,\" I said. \"We could be having the same conversation about a different person. And do you know what it would be? A future with a gorgeous guy who thinks about himself more than anyone else. And guess what? While I\u0027m watching him pursue his soccer dream, he\u0027d be sneaking off with a leggy blonde cheerleader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom sat on my bed, handling the bracelet. \"I knew I\u0027d found Mr. Right when I met your father. My mother wanted me to wait, too, and date different guys in college. And if I had, I wouldn\u0027t have been happy. I wouldn\u0027t have been in love. And I wouldn\u0027t have had you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard my dad coming up the stairs. \"Paul,\" she called to him. \"Look what Alexander gave Raven.\" My mom proudly held out my hand to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moving a little fast, aren\u0027t we?\" he asked. \"Shouldn\u0027t Alexander be talking to me first - or should I be talking to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one needs to talk to anyone,\" she said, softening the blow. \"It was a special present Alexander gave Raven. And I think we should be happy for her and leave it at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad examined the ring. \"Wow - is that real?\" I nodded. \"The boy has good taste. Although I already knew that,\" he said with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening I met Alexander just after sunset at the Mansion. With only a day until the joint birthday party at the Crypt, I didn\u0027t want anything to get in the way of it - including unwanted vampires. I was dressed and ready to go to the club, but when I met Alexander in his room, he wasn\u0027t ready. He was rummaging around in his closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander had other plans. \"Phoenix needs to come to the Crypt tonight,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have Jameson drop you off at the club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight?\" I asked, goose bumps shuddering down my spine. The thought of seeing Phoenix again - especially when I knew he was reallyAlexander - thrilled me. And his being on a secret mission made him that much sexier to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing major happened last night - no unknown vampires popping in - or at least none that we knew about,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s not like the Maxwells to cave so easily. The Covenant door still remaining locked means Jagger is planning to use it for something. We can\u0027t wait any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" I said. The more I fell in love with the Crypt, the harder it would be for me to lose it if unknown vampires started coming. \"We have to have proof that vampires aren\u0027t being invited,\" I said, \"and Phoenix has the power to do that.\" I watched as Alexander continued to scour through his closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phoenix can save this club, too,\" I said. \"If it wasn\u0027t for him taking over the Coffin Club and, at the last moment, giving the reigns over to the clubsters, Jagger wouldn\u0027t even have that club. He\u0027s almost like a superhero.\" \"All right,\" Alexander said, pulling out a pair of black leather pants and a motorcycle jacket and tossing them on the bed. \"It\u0027s time for you to go. I\u0027ll see you at the club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring at his sexy outfit strewn on his coffin, I almost had a change of heart. \"This isn\u0027t easy, you know. I\u0027d rather be with you - as Alexander, Phoenix, or whomever - than alone in that nightclub.\" \"Get out of here,\" he said playfully as he put on a tight white T-shirt. I did my best to tear myself away from my handsome boyfriend. \"And don\u0027t forget that British accent,\" I called back to him as I left his room. \"It goes right through my heart!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-16.html","bookId":2146,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:51 PM"}
