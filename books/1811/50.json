She turns it over in her hands, biting her lip. “I guess I’ll just have to occupy myself . . . by taking X-rated selfies on your camera. We can develop them together when you get back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a second to enjoy the images that pop into my head—that hopefully will be showing up on my camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hand her two extra rolls of film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my time kissing her good-bye before I compel my legs to move to the door. Just before I walk out, Dee calls, “Matthew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop and turn to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like every other time she’s said it today, a goofy, ridiculously happy grin appears on my lips. I walk back to the bed and kiss her yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the record? I’m never going to get tired of hearing you say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles contentedly. “Hurry back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I end up running the whole way to my bike—so I can do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside Drew’s apartment door, it’s the same old same old. I pound on it and I call, but the only response I get is one bump of a baseball thrown against the door when I ask him if he’s still breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and rest my hand on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s time for some tough love. Well past the time for it, if you want to know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, you gotta man up. Whatever happened between you and Kate—however badly you f**ked up—it’s not gonna get any better if you don’t come out and deal with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try taunting him. “In all the years we’ve known each other, I never would’ve guessed you were capable of being such a gigantic pu**y. You realize you’re completely wrecking my image of you, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Drew. Open the door. Remember how I was after Rosaline? You were there for me . . . let me return the favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird strike, and I’m out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tap the door, the way I’d tap Drew’s fist if these were better days. “Okay, man, have it your way. I’ll be back tomorrow, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door vibrates from the impact of the ball on the other side, and I know he’s heard me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head as I walk back to the elevator. Because tomorrow, when I come back, I won’t be alone. I really didn’t want to have to do this—but it’s been a frigging week. He’s left me no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s time to go nuclear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exit the lobby of the building, stepping out onto the sidewalk. Then I take my phone out and dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picks up after two rings, greeting me by name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Alexandra. Listen, I need your help . . . it’s about Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the rest, as they say, is history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now you have the full story. The parts you didn’t get to see before, the answers to some of the questions that might’ve been bugging you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to advice, I’m kind of tapped out at the moment—there’s not a whole lot left to give. But I’ll leave you with this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is a short, wild ride. Don’t try to put the brakes on, don’t overanalyze or try to control it. If you’re lucky, like I was, you’ll find that perfect someone who’ll sit next to you and hold your hand through every curve, every up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that? Just makes it even more fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix months later . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLas Vegas, Nevada. The Elvis Chapel. It’s technically called A Little White Wedding Chapel, but because there’s an Elvis impersonator officiating the services, it’ll always be the Elvis Chapel to me. We wait in an adjoining room for our turn, surrounded by signed photographs of the celebrities who’ve exchanged vows here over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been six months since our first kiss on the dance floor. Maybe you think that’s too fast. Maybe you think we’re crazy. But for Dee and me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrazy is actually pretty normal. Let’s look at how we became engaged, for example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Fisher, please lay back down!” the nurse yells in a commanding voice, but I ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a f**king disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of a private, romantic evening at Dee’s favorite restaurant, I’ve somehow ended up in a hospital gown, on a gurney, in the back room of the goddamn ER. The only thing that could make it worse would be if the engagement ring was to get stolen by a sticky-fingered nurse or random homeless person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI designed the ring myself, and it’s perfect. A flawless two-carat diamond surrounded by emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. It’s colorful, unique, just like Dee. Now I just have to give it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dig my pants out of the standard-issue plastic hospital bag and pull the ring box from the pocket. Then, before the nurses can stop me, I sprint down the short hall to the emergency room waiting area where Delores is. She stands up as soon as she sees me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to her and drop to one bended knee. “I want you to belong to me. And I want to be yours. I want to be the reason for your smiles. I want to spend the rest of my life listening to all your theories and teaching you the difference between a good movie and a bad one. I want to be eighty years old, holding your hand during couples skate—and I promise to love you every single moment from now until then. Will you marry me, Delores?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah—so that was my romantic proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee didn’t want to have a long engagement, and I was thrilled about that. The “why wait?” philosophy is how we started, and it hasn’t let us down yet. So, here we are—me, Dee, Drew, and Kate—in Vegas for a quickie wedding and kick-ass celebration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look in the mirror and try to straighten my tie, but it doesn’t cooperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure about this?” Drew asks from behind me, dressed in his own custom-tailored tuxedo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never been more sure, buddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give up on the tie. Screw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you really sure?” Drew asks. “It’s not too late to back out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk. “It’s way too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes drop to my crooked tie, and he steps in front of me to fix it—like a father helping his teenage son on prom night. Once it’s straightened to Drew’s satisfaction, he puts his hands on my shoulders, looks me in the eyes, and says, “Are you sure you’re really sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s frowning voice calls from across the room. “Drew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, babe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s sure. Don’t ask him again or I’m not going to be happy. And you won’t like it if I’m not happy.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tamed-tangled-3/page-50.html","bookId":1811,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM"}
