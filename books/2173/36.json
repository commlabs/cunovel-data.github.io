Only three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allowed them a moment to digest this reminder that Gowachin trial formalities still dominated this arena, and were like no other such formalities in the ConSentiency.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It could\u0027ve been fifty judges up there on that bench.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had witnessed Gowachin trials where people were picked at random off the streets to sit in judgment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Such jurists took their duties seriously, but their overt behavior could lead another sentient species to question this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Gowachin chattered back and forth, arranged parties, exchanged jokes, asked each other rude questions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was an ancient pattern.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The jurists were required to become \"a single organism.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin had their own ways of rushing that process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this Tribunal was composed of just three judges, only one of them visibly Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were separate entities, their actions heavy with mannerisms foreign to the Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Even Broey, tainted by Dosadi, would be unfamiliar to the Gowachin observers.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No \"single organism\" here holding to the immutable form beneath Gowachin Law.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That had to be deeply disturbing to the Legums who advised Ceylang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey leaned forward, addressed the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll dispense with the usual arguments while this new development

conferring among themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There seemed to be a difference of opinion among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch shuffled to the death-focus of the arena, the place where every witness was required to stand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He glanced at the instruments of pain arrayed beneath the judicial bench, cast a wary look at McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The old High Magister appeared harried, and undignified.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That hurried conference to explore this development must\u0027ve been a sore trial to the old Gowachin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie crossed to the formal position beside Aritch, addressed the judges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we have Aritch, High Magister of the Running Phylum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We were told that if guilt were to be found in this arena, Aritch bore that guilt.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He, so we were led to believe, was the one who made the decision to imprison Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But how can that be so?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch is old, but he isn\u0027t as old as Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then perhaps his alleged guilt is to be found in concealing the imprisonment of Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But Aritch summoned an agent of BuSab and sent that agent openly to Dosadi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA disturbance among the eight shackled prisoners interrupted McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Several of the prisoners were trying to get to their feet, but the links of the shackles were too short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the judicial bench, Parando started to lean forward, but Broey hauled him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Parando and others were recalling the verities of a Gowachin Courtarena, the constant reversals of concepts common throughout the rest of the ConSentiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be guilty is to be innocent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Thus, to be innocent is to be guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a sharp command from Broey, the prisoners grew quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aritch, conscious of the sacred responsibilities which he carried upon his back as a mother carries her tads, was deliberately named to receive the punishment blow lest that punishment be directed at all Gowachin everywhere.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Who chose this innocent High Magister to suffer for all Gowachin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie pointed to the eight shackled prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are these people?\" Parando demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie allowed the question to hang there for a long count.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Parando knew who these eight were.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Did he think he could divert the present course of events by such a blatant ploy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, McKie spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will enlighten the court in due course.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;My duty, however, comes first.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;My client\u0027s innocence comes first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey held up a webbed hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Ceylang\u0027s advisors hurried past McKie, asked and received permission to confer with Ceylang.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A thwarted Parando sat like a condemned man watching this conversation as though he hoped to find reprieve there.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon had hunched forward, head buried in his arms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey obviously controlled the Tribunal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advisor Legum was known to McKie, one Lagag of a middling reputation, an officer out of breeding.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His words to Ceylang were low and intense, demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conference ended, Lagag hurried back to his companions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They now understood the tenor of McKie\u0027s defense.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch must have known all along that he could be sacrificed here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The ConSentient Covenant no longer permitted the ancient custom where the Gowachin audience had poured into the arena to kill with bare hands and claws the innocent defendant.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But let Aritch walk from here with the brand of innocence upon him; he would not take ten paces outside the arena\u0027s precincts before being torn to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d been worried admiration in the glance Lagag had given McKie in passing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes . . . now they understood why McKie had maneuvered for a small and vulnerable judicial panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eight prisoners began a new disturbance which Broey silenced with a shout.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He signaled for McKie to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aritch\u0027s design was that I expose Dosadi, return and defend him against the charge that he had permitted illegal psychological experiments upon an unsuspecting populace.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was prepared to sacrifice himself for others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie sent a wry glance at Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Let the High Magister try to fight in half-truths in that defense!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, the Dosadi populace was not unsuspecting.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In fact, forces under the command of Keila Jedrik had moved to take control of Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Judge Broey will affirm that she had succeeded in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, McKie pointed to the shackled prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But these conspirators, these people who designed and profited from the Dosadi Experiment, ordered the death of Keila Jedrik!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She was murdered this morning on Tutalsee to prevent my using her at the proper moment to prove Aritch\u0027s innocence.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Judge Broey is witness to the truth of what I say.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Keila Jedrik was brought into this arena yesterday only that she might be traced and killed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie raised both arms in an eloquent gesture of completion, lowered his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch looked stricken.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He saw it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If the eight prisoners denied the charges, they faced Aritch\u0027s fate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And they must know by now that Broey wanted them Gowachin-guilty.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They could bring in the Caleban contract and expose the body-exchange plot, but that risked having McKie defend or prosecute them because he\u0027d already locked them to his actual client, Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey would affirm this, too.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were at Broey\u0027s mercy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If they were Gowachin-guilty, they walked free only here on Tandaloor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Innocent, they died here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though they were one organism, the eight turned their heads and looked at Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Indeed!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What would Aritch do?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If he agreed to sacrifice himself, the eight might live.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ceylang, too, focused on Aritch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the entire arena there was a sense of collective held breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie watched Ceylang.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How candid had Aritch\u0027s people been with their Wreave?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Did she know the full Dosadi story?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke the silence, exposing her knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She chose to aim her attack at McKie on the well-known dictum that, when all else failed, you tried to discredit the opposing Legum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKie, is this how you defend these eight people whom only you name as client?\" Ceylang demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it was delicate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would Broey go along?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie countered her probe with a question of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you suggesting that you\u0027d prosecute these people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t charge them!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To prove Aritch\u0027s innocence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you call them client.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Will you defend them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA collective gasp arose from the cluster of advisors behind her near the arena doorway.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They\u0027d seen the trap.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If McKie accepted the challenge, the judges had no choice but to bring the eight into the arena under Gowachin forms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ceylang had trapped herself into the posture of prosecutor against the eight.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d said, in effect, that she affirmed their guilt.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Doing so, she lost her case against Aritch and her life was immediately forfeit.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She was caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes glittered with the unspoken question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would McKie do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet, McKie thought.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not yet, my precious Wreave dupe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention to Parando.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would they dare introduce the Caleban contract?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The eight prisoners were only the exposed tip of the shadowy forces, a vulnerable tip.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They could be sacrificed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was clear that they saw this and didn\u0027t like it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No Gowachin Mrregs here with that iron submission to responsibility!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They loved life and its power, especially the ones who wore Human flesh.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How precious life must be for those who\u0027d lived many lives!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Very desperate, indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo McKie\u0027s Dosadi-conditioned eyes, it was as though he read the prisoners\u0027 thoughts.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were safest if they remained silent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Trust Parando.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Rely on Broey\u0027s enlightened greed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;At the worst, they could live out what life was left to them here on Tandaloor, hoping for new bodies before the flesh they now wore ran out of vitality.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;As long as they still lived they could hope and scheme.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Perhaps another Caleban could be hired, more Pcharkys found . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch broke, unwilling to lose what had almost been his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Magister\u0027s Tandaloor accent was hoarse with protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I did supervise the tests on Dosadi\u0027s population!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what tests do you refer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dosadi . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch fell silent, seeing the trap.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;More than a million Dosadi Gowachin already had left their planet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would Aritch make targets of them?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Anything he said could open the door to proof that the Dosadis were superior to non-Dosadis.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Any Gowachin (or Human, for that matter) could well become a target in the next few minutes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One had only to denounce a selected Human or Gowachin as Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ConSentient fears would do the rest.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And any of his arguments could be directed into exposure of Dosadi\u0027s real purpose.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He obviously saw the peril in that, had seen it from the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Magister confirmed this analysis by glancing at the Ferret Wreaves in the audience.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What consternation it would create among the secretive Wreaves to learn that another species could masquerade successfully as one of their own!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie could not leave matters where they stood, though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He threw a question at Aritch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were the original transportees to Dosadi apprised of the nature of the project?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only they could testify to

end, and that\u0027d been as much recognition of total failure as anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie waited, knowing what had to happen now. Here was Ceylang\u0027s moment of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey addressed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have suggested that you would prosecute these eight

Jedrik.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey was certain in his mind that Jedrik did not occupy this Legum body on the arena floor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Now, he could show the puppet masters what a Dosadi-born could do.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And McKie saw that Broey intended to move fast, much faster than anyone had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone except Jedrik, and she was only a silent (memory?) in McKie\u0027s awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving given the appearance of deliberation, Broey spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can order these eight bound over to ConSentient jurisdiction if McKie agrees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eight stirred, subsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" McKie said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He glanced at Ceylang.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She made no protest, seeing the futility.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her only hope now lay in the possible deterrent presence of the Ferret Wreaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I so order it,\" Broey said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He spared a triumphant glance for Parando.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Let a ConSentient jurisdiction decide if these eight are guilty of murder and other conspiracy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was well within the bounds of the Covenant between the ConSentiency and Gowachin, but the Gowachin members of his audience didn\u0027t like it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Their Law was best!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Angry whistlings could be heard all around the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey rose half-out of his seat, pointed at the instruments of pain arrayed beneath him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin in the audience fell silent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They, better than anyone, knew that no person here, not even a member of the audience, was outside the Tribunal\u0027s power.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And many understood clearly now why those bloody tools had been displayed here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Thoughtful people had anticipated the problem of keeping order in this arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResponding to the silent acceptance of his authority, Broey sank back into his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParando was staring at Broey as though having just discovered the presence of a monster in this Gowachin form.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Many people would be reassessing Broey now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch held his attitude of complete submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeylang\u0027s thoughts almost hummed in the air around her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Every way she turned, she saw only a tangle of unmanageable tendrils and a blocked passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie saw that it was time to bring matters to a head.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He crossed to the foot of the judicial bench, lifted a short spear from the instruments there.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He brandished the barbed, razor-edged weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who sits on this Tribunal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, Aritch had issued such a challenge.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie, repeating it, pointed with the spear, answered his own question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Gowachin of my choice, one supposedly wronged by the Dosadi project.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Were you wronged, Broey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie faced Parando.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And here we have a Human from Lirat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Is that not the case, Parando?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am from Lirat, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am prepared to bring a parade of witnesses into this arena to testify as to your occupation on Lirat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would you care to state that occupation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dare you question this Tribunal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParando glared down at McKie, face flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer his question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Broey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParando looked at Bildoon, who still sat with face concealed in his arms, face down on the bench.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Something about the PanSpechi repelled Parando, but he knew he had to have Bildoon\u0027s vote to overrule Broey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Parando nudged the PanSpechi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Inert flesh rolled away from Parando\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing doom, Bildoon had retreated into the creche.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Somewhere, an unprepared PanSpechi body was being rushed into acceptance of that crushed identity.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The emergence of a new Bildoon would require considerable time.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They did not have that time.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When the creche finally brought forth a functioning persona, it would not be heir to Bildoon\u0027s old powers in BuSab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParando was alone, exposed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He stared at the spear in McKie\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie favored the arena with a sweeping glance before speaking once more to Parando.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I quote that renowned expert on Gowachin Law, High Magister Aritch:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0027ConSentient Law always makes aristocrats of its practitioners.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin Law stands beneath that pretension.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin Law asks:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Who knows the people?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only such a one is fit to judge in the Courtarena.\u0027\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That is Gowachin Law according to High Magister Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That is the law in this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, McKie gave Parando a chance to speak, received only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you are truly fit to judge here,\" McKie suggested.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Are you an artisan?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A philosopher?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Perhaps you\u0027re a humorist?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;An artist?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ahhh, maybe you are that lowliest of workmen, he who tends an automatic machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParando remained silent, gaze locked on the spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of these?\" McKie asked.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Then I shall supply the answer.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You are a professional legalist, one who gives legal advice, even to advice on Gowachin Law.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You, a Human, not even a Legum, dare to speak of Gowachin Law!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any muscular warning signal, McKie leaped forward, hurled the spear at Parando, saw it strike deeply into the man\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne for Jedrik!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith bubbling gasp, Parando sagged out of sight behind the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey, seeing the flash of anger in McKie\u0027s effort, touched the blue box in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave no fear, Broey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not yet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I still need you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, more than Broey knew it was really McKie in this flesh.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not Jedrik.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Those members of the shadow force watching this scene and able to plot would make the expected deduction because they did not know how freely and completely Jedrik and McKie had shared.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;To the shadow force, McKie would\u0027ve known Parando\u0027s background.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They\u0027d trace out that mistake in short order.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;So this was McKie in the arena.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But he\u0027d left Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There could be only one conclusion in the plotters\u0027 minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie had Caleban help!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had Calebans to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd McKie thought:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You have only McKie to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grew aware that grunts of Gowachin approval were sounding all around the arena.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They accepted him as a Legum, thus they accepted his argument.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Such a judge deserved killing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch set the precedent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie improved on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth had found an approved way to kill a flawed judge, but McKie\u0027s act had etched a Gowachin precedent into the ConSentient legal framework.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The compromise which had brought Gowachin and ConSentient Law into the Covenant of shared responsibility for the case in this arena would be seen by the Gowachin as a first long step toward making their Law supreme over all other law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch had half-turned, looking toward the bench, a glittering appraisal in his eyes which said the Gowachin had salvaged something here after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie strode back to confront Ceylang.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He faced her as the forms required while he called for judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bildoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parando?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Broey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judgment for Defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosadi accent rang across the arena.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Gowachin Federation, only member of the ConSentiency which dared permit a victim to judge those accused of victimizing him, had received a wound to its pride.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But they\u0027d also received something they would consider of inestimable value - a foothold for their Law in the ConSentiency, plus a memorable court performance which was about to end in the drama they loved best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie stepped to within striking distance of Ceylang, extended his right hand straight out to the side, palm up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttendants scurried.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There came the sound of the blue box being opened.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Presently, the knife handle was slapped firmly into McKie\u0027s palm.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He closed his fingers around it, thinking as he did so of all those countless others who had faced this moment in a Gowachin Courtarena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ceylang?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I submit to the ruling of this court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie saw the Ferret Wreaves rise from their seats as one person.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They stood ready to leap down into the arena and avenge Ceylang no matter the consequences.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They could do nothing else but carry out the role which the Gowachin had designed for them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Few in the arena had misunderstood their presence here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No matter the measurement of the wound, the Gowachin did not suffer such things gladly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn odd look of camaraderie passed between Ceylang and McKie then.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Here they stood, the only two non-Gowachin in the ConSentient universe who had passed through that peculiar alchemy which transformed a person into a Legum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One of them was supposed to die immediately, and the other would not long survive that death.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yet, they understood each other the way siblings understand each other.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Each had shed a particular skin to become something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, deliberately, McKie extended the tip of his blade toward Ceylang\u0027s left jowl, noting the myriad pocks of her triad exchanges there.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She trembled but remained firm.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Deftly, with the swiftest of flicking motions, McKie added another pock to those on her left jowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ferret Wreaves were the first to understand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They sank back into their seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeylang gasped, touched a tendril to the wound.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Many times she had been set free by such a wound, moving on to new alliances which did not completely sunder the old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, McKie thought she might not accept, but the increasing sounds of approval all around the arena overcame her doubts.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The noise of that approval climbed to a near deafening crescendo before subsiding.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Even the Gowachin joined this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How dearly they loved such legal nuances!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePitching his voice for Ceylang alone, McKie spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should apply for a position in BuSab.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The new director would look with favor upon your application.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make a Wreave bet on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe favored him with the grimace which passed for a smile among Wreaves, spoke the traditional words of triad farewell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were well and truly wed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she, too, had seen the truth in their unique closeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie betrayed the extent of his esoteric knowledge by producing the correct response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By my mark I know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed no surprise.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A good brain there, not up to Dosadi standards, but good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell and truly wed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping a firm lock on his emotions (the Dosadi in him helped), McKie crossed to confront Aritch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Client Aritch, you are innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie displayed the fleck of Wreave blood on the knife tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The forms have been obeyed and you are completely exonerated.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I rejoice with all of those who love justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point in the old days, the jubilant audience would\u0027ve fallen on the hapless client, would\u0027ve fought for bloody scraps with which to parade through the city.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No doubt Aritch would\u0027ve preferred that.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was a traditionalist.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He confirmed that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am glad to quit these times, McKie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie mused aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who will be the Mrreg now that you\u0027re . . . disqualified?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Whoever it is, I doubt he\u0027ll be as good as the one he replaces.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It will profit that next Mrreg to reflect upon the fragile and fugitive value to be gained from the manipulation of others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlowering, Aritch turned and shambled toward the doorway out of the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the Gowachin from the audience already were leaving, no doubt hoping to greet Aritch outside.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had no desire to witness that remnant of an ancient ritual.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had other concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell and truly wed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething burned in his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And still he felt that soft and sleeping presence in his awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Broey who, true to his duty as a judge, would be the last to leave the arena.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey sat blandly contemplating this place where he\u0027d displayed the first designs of his campaign for supremacy in the ConSentiency.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He would accept nothing less short of his own death.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Those shadowy puppet masters would be the first to feel his rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat fitted the plan McKie and Jedrik had forged between them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In a way, it was still the plan of those who\u0027d bred and conditioned Jedrik for the tasks she\u0027d performed so exquisitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was McKie\u0027s thought that those nameless, faceless Dosadis who stood in ghostly ranks behind Jedrik had made a brave choice.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Faced with the evidence of body exchange all around, they\u0027d judged that to be a deadly choice - the conservatism of extinction.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Instead, they\u0027d trusted sperm and ova, always seeking the new and better, the changed, the adapted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And they\u0027d launched their simultaneous campaign to eliminate the Pcharkys of their world, reserving only that one for their final gamble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was well that this explosive secret had been kept here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie felt grateful to Ceylang.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d known, but even when it might\u0027ve helped her, she\u0027d remained silent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;BuSab would now have time to forge ways of dealing with this problem.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ceylang would be valuable there.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And perhaps more would be learned about PanSpechi, Calebans, and Taprisiots.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If only Jedrik . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a fumbling in his memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only Jedrik what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke laughingly in his mind as she\u0027d always spoken there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie suppressed a fit of trembling, almost fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful with our body,\" she said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It\u0027s the only one we have now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caressed his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ours, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it hallucination?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He ached with longing to hold her in his arms, to feel her arms around him, her body pressed to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s lost to us forever, love, but see what we have in exchange.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he didn\u0027t respond, she said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One can always be watching while the other acts . . . or sleeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where I\u0027ve always been when we exchanged.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her parallel to him in the shared flesh and, as he voluntarily drew back, he came to rest in contact with her mutual memories, still looking from his own eyes but aware that someone else peered out there, too, that someone else turned this body to face Broey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearful that he might be trapped here, McKie almost panicked, but Jedrik gave him back the control of their flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you doubt me, love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt shame.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was nothing she could hide from him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He knew how she felt, what she\u0027d been willing to sacrifice for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d have made their perfect Mrreg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even suggest it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went pouring through his arena memories then and her joy delighted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, marvelous, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Beautiful!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I couldn\u0027t have done it better.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And Broey still doesn\u0027t suspect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttendants were taking the eight prisoners out of the arena now, all of them still shackled.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The audience benches were almost empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of joy began filtering through McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost something but I gained something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t lose as much as Aritch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I gained more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie permitted himself to stare up at Broey then, studying the Gowachin judge with Dosadi eyes and two sets of awareness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch and the eight accused of murder were things of the past.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They and many others like them would be dead or powerless before another ten-day.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey already had shown the speed with which he intended to act.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Supported by his troop of Jedrik-chosen aides, Broey would occupy the seats of power, consolidating lines of control in that shadow government, eliminating every potential source of opposition he could touch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He believed Jedrik dead and, while McKie was clever, McKie and BuSab were not a primary concern.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One struck at the real seats of power.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Being Dosadi, Broey could not act otherwise.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And he\u0027d been almost the best his planet had ever produced.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik-within chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, with juggernaut certainty, Broey would create a single target for BuSab.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And Jedrik had refined the simulation pattern by which Broey could be anticipated.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey would find McKie waiting for him at the proper moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind McKie would be a new BuSab, an agency directed by a person whose memories and abilities were amplified by the one person superior to Broey that Dosadi had ever produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding there in the now silent arena, McKie wondered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will Broey realize he does our work for us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we show him that he failed to kill me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the purest obedience to Gowachin forms, without any sign of the paired thoughts twining through his mind, McKie bowed toward the surviving jurist, turned, and left.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And all the time, Jedrik-within was planning . . . plotting . . . planning . . .
