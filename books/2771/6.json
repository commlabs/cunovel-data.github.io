But I can\u0027t help if you won\u0027t share with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at the sky and shake my head. \"I don\u0027t need your help. My parents and sister ... they need help more than me. Why don\u0027t you treat them like the guinea pig?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been away for almost a year. Give \u0027em a break. You act as though they should be apologizing to you instead of the other way around. What did they do wrong, huh? Maybe you should blame yourself once in a while, Caleb. The experience might be eye opening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The truth would be eye opening,\" I say back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. Click. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"Nothing. Just forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon opens his folder again. That folder probably tells Damon everything about my life before, during, and after my arrest. I wonder if the time I tee-peed Joe Sanders\u0027 house is in there. Or the time I beat up a guy from Fremont High for teasing my sister about her perm gone wrong. I used to be looked up to, the cool rebel. Now I\u0027m a convict. Not cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hands me a few sheets of paper. \"You live in a small town, Caleb. Not much in choices for community service jobs, but on your questionnaire you said you had experience in construction and small home improvements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I worked construction during summers for my uncle,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. You\u0027ll be required to check in at The Trusty Nail hardware store on Monday after school at three forty-five sharp. Don\u0027t be late. They\u0027ll assign you a job site and drop off all supply materials needed. When you\u0027re done with a job, get a completion sheet signed. Easy enough?\" Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just have a few more questions. Then you don\u0027t have to see my ugly mug for another week.\" When Damon looks up at me he asks, \"Any physical contact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As in sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shrugs. \"I don\u0027t know, you tell me. Was the old girlfriend waiting on your front stoop when you got home yesterday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urge to laugh gets caught in my throat. \"Hardly. My sister hugged me, my dad shook my hand, and I got a few pats on the back from my mom\u0027s random friends last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you initiate it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027re creeping me out, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, some guys have attachment problems when they get home. They have a hard time understanding what physical contact is appropriate and what--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I touched a girl,\" I say, interrupting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Tell me about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think back to last night, when Maggie tried to stand. The fierce pain she felt was emphasized by her clenched teeth, balled fists, and furrowed eyebrows. Since I\u0027ve been home, Maggie has been the only person I\u0027ve actually reached out to touch. It hadn\u0027t gone well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A girl needed help getting up, so I tried to steady her. End of story.\" Well, sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she thank you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate, then pick up a rock and chuck it all the way to the baseball field on the other side of the park. \"She yanked herself out of my grasp. Isn\u0027t that what you want to hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and give him a look. He knows I\u0027m not fuckin\u0027 with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you were too rough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was not too rough,\" I say harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach around and massage the persistent knot on the back of my neck. If I don\u0027t answer, Damon\u0027ll probably show up tomorrow and every day until I spill the beans. What\u0027s the big deal anyway? I glance at the old oak, half expecting to spot Maggie sitting there, her expression wary and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over to Damon who\u0027s still waiting for an answer. Then I finally say it. \"I touched the girl who I went to jail for maiming.\" Click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Sabrina asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting on the floor in front of my locker at school, figuring out which books I need to bring with me to first period. First days of school are always hard to adjust to after a summer off. I\u0027ve had a whole year off. I look up at her and say, \"Yeah, except I\u0027m dreading Mrs. Glassman\u0027s trig class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re not freaking out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear she\u0027s tough, but I can--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not talking about Glassman, Maggie. I\u0027m talking about Caleb being in school today. Duh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lose the grip on the book I\u0027m holding. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in Meyer\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. One. Minute. \"I heard he wasn\u0027t coming back to school.\" Mom told me this morning; she heard it at the diner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You obviously heard wrong, \u0027cause Danielle saw him.\" I peek down J Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said seeing him was no biggie.\" Um...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrianne runs down the hall, heading in my direction. \"Did you hear?\" she says when she catches her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She heard,\" Sabrina says, her hand on her hip. \"But she says it\u0027s no big deal. The girl has serious denial issues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting my locker, I shove the mass of books inside. I\u0027m still sitting on the hard tile floor, but don\u0027t trust myself to stand without making a bigger scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make matters worse, now Danielle is walking down the hall with five people flanking her. She\u0027s deep in conversation, probably relaying the story of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s only the first day of school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad I didn\u0027t get the packets for Spain in the mail yet. I need something positive to focus on today. Because seeing Caleb--again--is a big deal. The biggest. And I can do nothing but sit here and play the unaffected girl. The affected doesn\u0027t do so great playing the unaffected. At least when it\u0027s me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There she is!\" Danielle\u0027s excitement makes everyone crowd around me. I wish I could snap my fingers and make them all disappear. Or make me disappear. I liked it better when I was invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s the scoop?\" Sabrina asks Danielle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ...\" Danielle says, pausing on purpose to make sure she has everyone\u0027s attention. \"My mom is on the school board and I overheard they made Caleb a deal. He has to take junior final exams in all his classes and then he can officially be a senior. If he fails, he\u0027ll be held back a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a dumb wrestling jock,\" Brynn Healey chimes in. \"He\u0027ll never pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not dumb; I know he\u0027s smarter than people think. When we were in elementary school, Caleb got a ribbon for getting the highest GPA in sixth grade one semester. He was proud; you should have seen the huge grin on his face as they handed the ribbon to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb got teased by his friends for proudly displaying it on his sports trophy shelf. They started calling him names and accused him of having a secret affair with our three-hundred-pound English teacher, Ms. Bolinsky. After that, Leah told me he gave her the ribbon. Caleb\u0027s grades dropped and he never got another ribbon. The relief on his face each time they presented it to someone else was so obvious. Well, obvious to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell rings and, luckily, the mob starts to disperse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just pray Caleb ignores me if we ever come face to face again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my locker to steady myself and stand. Closing the door, I head toward my first-period class. I\u0027m late, but assume my limp excuse will work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch sight of Leah coming out of the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy old best friend walks toward me, not paying attention because she\u0027s looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf things were different, I\u0027d ask her why she wears all black clothes. If things were different, I\u0027d ask her how it feels having her brother back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finally does look up and notices I\u0027m in her path, she makes an about-face and scurries away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school principal is standing over my desk. The desk has been placed in the man\u0027s office so I can take the dreaded exams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should never have come back to school. I\u0027d gone to classes in the DOC; it was part of the juvenile inmate program. The tests aren\u0027t the problem, either. It\u0027s the way Meyer is staring at me like he\u0027s never seen an ex-con before. The unnecessary attention is driving me insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus on the second final exam placed in front of me this morning. It isn\u0027t as if I\u0027m acing the tests so far, but I haven\u0027t flunked them either. \"You done?\" Meyer asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have one more algebra question left, but with the guy standing over me it\u0027s close to impossible to concentrate. Not wanting to fuck it up, I\u0027m doing my best to answer the question correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me five minutes longer than it should, but I\u0027m finally ready for the next exam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go have lunch, Becker,\" Meyer orders after collecting the test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch? In the cafeteria with half the student body? No way, man. \"I\u0027m not hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gotta eat. Feed that brain of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did he mean by that? Stop being paranoid, I tell myself. That\u0027s one of the side effects of being jailed. You always analyze people\u0027s words and expressions as if they\u0027re playing with you. A joke on the ex-con, ha ha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand. Beyond the principal\u0027s door are over four hundred students waiting for a glimpse of the guy who went to jail. I rub the knot that just reappeared on the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Meyer urges. \"You have three more exams so move those feet. Be back here in twenty-five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my sweaty palm on the door handle, twist, and take a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the hallway, I don\u0027t waste any time and head for the cafeteria. Once inside, I ignore all of the stares. Coffee. I need strong, black coffee. That\u0027ll ease my nerves and keep me awake the rest of the afternoon. Scanning the room, I remember there\u0027s no coffee available for students. I bet they have a coffee pot in the teachers\u0027 lounge, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould they notice if I steal one cup? Or will they call the police and claim I\u0027m a thief in addition to the other labels already tattooed on my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot my sister sitting alone. She used to sit by Maggie and their other friends, giggling and flirting with my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what sucked about having a twin of the opposite sex. It was bad enough when my sister had crushes on my friends and would bug us when they\u0027d hang at my house. She\u0027d slap on the makeup and act all giggly and flirty ... I still cringe thinking about it. What\u0027s worse is when I realized the tide changed and my friends actually wanted to get into my sister\u0027s pants. That changed it into a whole new ball game. I spent a lot of time last summer threatening to cut my own friends\u0027 balls off. I\u0027ve always made sure my sister was protected, her reputation as well as her social status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year has gone by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy, how things have changed. Nobody even looks in Leah\u0027s direction now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sis,\" I say, straddling the cafeteria bench opposite her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah twirls spaghetti around her fork, the hot lunch special of the day. \"I heard about the exams,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a short, cynical laugh. \"My brain is already fried and I still got three more to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you passed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"Don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rumor has it Morehouse made up a social studies exam you couldn\u0027t possibly pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t I already pay my debt to society? \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Caleb, what if you flunk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to think about it, so I ignore her question. When I happen to glance at the entrance to the cafeteria, in walks Kendra. Is she my ex, or did we just take a leave of absence from each other? The answer lies in her reaction to me. She hasn\u0027t spotted me yet. Good. I\u0027m not ready to talk to her in front of the whole frickin\u0027 school. \"I gotta go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bolt out the side door of the cafeteria, the one leading to the small gymnasium. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-6.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
