How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"You\u0027re funny. Funny and fast.\" He looks like he\u0027s struggling with something, \"Wanna just have dinner with me? I promise it will be less entertaining than this.\" He points around us, \"It\u0027s the workout, it\u0027s messing with me. I think I\u0027m light-headed actually.\" His eyes twinkle, making me laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face is split into a huge grin, \"I\u0027d love to.\" I would? My racing heart is saying otherwise. But I remind myself everything is about the New Leaf. Freedom, adventure, taking risks, all are the New Leaf that I so badly need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in an hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow, \"Nothing.\" Why am I still answering questions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna meet at Chicken Lou\u0027s? One hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to think about it. I want to say no. I want to be rational, but I don’t. I smile and hop off the treadmill and grab a wipe, \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wipe down the machine and wave, \"See you in a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles the killer smile and makes my racing, panicking, and stressed out heart, stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian, Seb? No. Bastian? Maybe. Maybe just Sebastian. My mind races and fills with terrors. Bad things. Fears and possibilities. By the time I get to the room, I\u0027ve talked myself out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle is there getting all curled and dolled and pretty. She smiles until she sees the look on my face, \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Shell Shell what happened.\" She crawls onto my bed with her shoes on. My nose wrinkles involuntarily. She rolls her eyes and makes sure they don’t touch the blankets, I\u0027ll have to wash three times to get the smell of the store out. I\u0027ll have to wait for the weekend. The machines had waitlists I couldn’t bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met a boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes light up momentarily, \"Cute boy?\" Her face is panicked for a second. This is uncharted territory for me, us. She has always been the one with cute boy on her lips. Neither of us knows what to do about a cute boy and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twitch, \"Cutest boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, when I say it, \"Sebastian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe makes a face, \"What went wrong? I like that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. He asked me for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeals and does a weird butt-hopping thing on my bed, before I can finish. \"Where is he taking you? Oh my god, a real date. I could cry right now. You said yes to a boy and…wait…why do you look like that?\" her face drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t look at her, \"Nothing. I just think it\u0027s super weird he asked me out the first time he saw me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god. Em, you\u0027re never going to date and have a boyfriend and start this normal life you want so badly, if you don’t actually go on a date. Yeah, so what? He asked you out. He likes what he sees and wants to get to know you and see if he likes you.\" She takes my hand, \"You don’t have to do anything. It\u0027s just a date. No different than eating at the table back home, next to a boy. Dude. You got this. Bring the sani and have a meal. We did restaurants back home. You can do this. Wipe the cutlery down under the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gag a bit thinking about it and shake my head, \"I just can\u0027t okay.\" I stand and walk to the showers. I stay in extra long. I try to stay in so it\u0027s too late by the time I finish. But I can\u0027t. I go back to our room. She\u0027s gone, but the mirror has lipstick on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGO OR I WILL CUT YOUR HAIR OFF IN YOUR SLEEP!!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shudder at the writing and pull on a t-shirt and some jeans. I look back at the red lipstick and rush to it. I\u0027m wiping and cleaning in a frenzy before I realize it. I step back, horrified that the grease in the lipstick has permanently marked the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my phone out and send a quick message on my phone, \u0027I need a new mirror. Can Stuart bring one by later? Like a dressing mirror.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good evening to you too. How was the first day? Of course he can. What size?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the mirror and shake my head as I text, \u0027I don’t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027…Take a picture….\u0027 He\u0027s awfully saucy and impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the phone up and take the picture. It has me in it. I don’t look like me though. Not the way I see me. The girl in the mirror looks normal. Blonde, plain, blue eyes that sparkle with fake life inside of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore my thoughts and slip on my Nike sandals and of course my running watch. I love that it\u0027s plastic and washable. I pull my hair into a messy ponytail and don’t apply a drop of makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my wallet and leave, feeling weird. I start my chants, \"It\u0027s just like eating beside a boy at home.\" I wash, rinse and repeat this the entire way down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI send the picture when I\u0027m on the stairs. I then send another text. One that I have been dreading since I agreed, \u0027I\u0027m going out for dinner.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027With who?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Boy from the gym named Sebastian. Chicken Lou\u0027s\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell rings. I swallow and answer, \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs into the phone, \"Hi. So a boy from the gym? Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds annoyed and quiet. He\u0027s always quiet. I don’t know what to say. \"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always sounds hollow wherever he is and his voice is a whisper almost, \"I don’t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" His reaction throws me. \"Uhm. See, I already told him yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell him where you live or what your cell is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. You told me no one could know the number. I almost never even told Shell, even when you said it was okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call her Michelle, please. I don’t like Shell. It sounds infantile. Message me from the bathroom when you get there.\" He hangs up. He always does. He never speaks to me nicely, well he never really speaks to me. That\u0027s not what he\u0027s for. I hate that he called me infantile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick.\" I mutter and head for the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian is standing outside when I walk up. He smiles and I forget about the weird phone call and the ruined mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks the same as he did running. T-shirt that shows off his defined chest and arms and those shoulders, gah. His hair is shaggy and fluffy, most likely from being fresh washed and not styled. He has on baggy jeans and vans. I smile when I catch a glimpse of his running watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t think you were coming.\" He says. I glance at the time and groan. I\u0027m half an hour late and he waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited. I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile back at him, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens the door for me. We walk into the chaos and madness. He walks past me when we get inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s packed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m frozen instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wraps his hand around mine and drags me through the crowd. It\u0027s an instant shiver up my arm. Not because his hand is warm and so big, it eats up my whole hand. Not because his skin, against mine, is making my belly dance. Not because I am sexually attracted to him like a…I\u0027ll stop there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s because his SKIN IS TOUCHING MINE! His bare hand is against mine. I can\u0027t imagine how many times he picked his teeth or scratched. I don’t know him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m almost gagging. I feel the panic coming. Someone bumps into me, knocking me. Another person touches my arm, \"Sorry.\" They say. There is nothing but the sea of voices and chairs being shoved and waitresses shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes in the sea of people. I don’t have any choice. They\u0027ve surrounded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him pull me along and drag me through the crowd. I start my affirmations silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel grateful for the light and air I\u0027m breathing. I have hand sanitizer in my bag. I\u0027m grateful for hand sanitizer and the fact I remembered it. Every mess can be cleaned. I chant it. \u0027Every mess can be cleaned up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops. I walk into his back and his arms wrap around the back of me. Hugging me to him. My face is squished into his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is insanity.\" He shouts back at me. \"Are your eyes closed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI manage to open my trembling lips, \"Too m-many p-p-people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugs me tighter to him, \"Oh my god, Emalyn. I\u0027m so sorry. I should have warned you. This place is nuts every night of the week.\" He is shouting loudly. It doesn’t improve anything. He turns back the way we came in and pulls me out. He doesn’t hold my hand. He keeps me hugged into him, like a two person conga line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a moron. I feel it inside, but I can\u0027t stop and be normal. When the fresh air hits, I rip the sanitizer out of my pocket. I dump the cold gel across my hands. The smell of the pumpkin-spiced alcohol is therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he\u0027s watching me. I can almost feel the crazed look on his face. I can definitely imagine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish rubbing but don’t move. My lip is trembling. I\u0027m begging, pleading with myself not to choke up or freak out completely. I\u0027m not too worried the tears leaving my eyes, just flooding them. I don’t cry. My tears always find their way to my eyes, but they never actually make it out. Instead, they make kaleidoscopes and change everything for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t even know me and I\u0027ve revealed something so horrid. If he knew the rest, he would leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am seconds from pulling out the phone and sending the message for the car to come. I don’t know if my legs can walk back to the dorm. They have the cement boot feeling. The thick feeling they get. It\u0027s coming. It always does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis huge hand reaches over and takes the sanitizer like it’s dangerous. He squirts some on his hands and bathes them in it. He hands it back. But now that he\u0027s touched it I have to do it again. It\u0027s insanity but it\u0027s my insanity. I bathe in it a second time and put it away. He takes my hand in his and walks me silently down the busy road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\" He finally speaks, his voice is traumatized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t cry. Don’t cry. Don’t cry. The tears are there in my throat. They are threatening me. I almost believe they will go to my eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have guessed. You cleaned that treadmill like it was your job.\" He laughs. He is smiling. I can hear it in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up, \"I get it if you want to run away.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-3.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
