That\u0027s an order, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME:DATE RECORD [[ERROR]]ANOMALY\\Date unknown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\\ Captured Covenant dropship near flagship Ascendant Justice, in anomalous Slipspace bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faintly blue luminous walls of the Covenant dropship pressed in, which made John feel slightly claustrophobic. It was ironic when he stopped to think about it, because he was always inside his skintight armor. His fellow Spartans sat in the bay be- side him, motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred, designated Blue-Two on this mission, was John\u0027s second in command. He had fought in more than 120 campaigns, was a great leader and a quick thinker. Sometimes he took the respon- sibility of his command too seriously, though, empathizing too deeply with any wounded member of his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi, Blue-Three, was the team\u0027s zero-gee combat specialist. He had trained extensively with microgravity equipment and mar- tial arts at the UNSC\u0027s extreme-conditions facility on Chiron in orbit about Mars. He was as much at home in free fall as the rest of them were on solid land, and John was glad to have him on this mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton, Blue-Four, had John worried. He spent most of his life with his feet firmly planted on the ground. He\u0027d cross-trained in tracking, camouflage, and stealth, and had been used almost ex- clusively on ground-based operations. More than once he had expressed discomfort in zero-gee situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill, Blue-Five, was quiet, but had never failed to complete his mission. He wasn\u0027t always that way, though. When he was younger he was the one with the jokes and riddles that kept the team\u0027s spirits high. Something had hardened in him over the years . . . as it had in them all. But with Will something special had been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace, Blue-Six, had a knack for explosives. She could shape a charge to cut through a single steel bolt with only a whisper sound, or rig a hundred thousand liters of kerosene to blow into a firestorm from hell. Ironically her temper was nonexistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn opened a COM channel. \"Give me a systems check, Blue Team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive acknowledgment lights winked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This reminds me of the underwater mission Chief Mendez sent us on at Emerald Cove,\" Fred whispered. \"When he sabotaged half our air tanks? And we ended up stealing his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after,\" Anton said, laughing, \"we ditched him and camped on that island. It was a week with nothing to do but light bonfires, bake clams, and surf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmrnmm,\" Grace added, \"calamari.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn wondered if Emerald Cove even existed anymore. The UNSC had abandoned that colony a decade ago. The Covenant had most likely glassed that world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue Team.\" Polaski\u0027s voice broke over the COM. \"Local conditions are as calm as they\u0027re going to get. Exiting in three...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwo... one!\u0027 John felt the acceleration in the pit of his stomach. He rose, moved to the hatch, and popped it open. Outside, Ascendant Jus- tice\u0027s hull moved past them—almost every square centimeter of the flagship\u0027s polished alloy skin had been scarred by heat and micrometeors; tendrils of metal vapor snaked and shimmered in the vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Ascendant Justice\u0027s upper deck he saw the looming shadow of the inverted UNSC frigate Gettysburg still miraculously attached. It was on fire, pockmarked with craters, and venting atmosphere, but it was remarkably intact. If not for the thousands of dead Naval personnel undoubtedly on board, he might have christened the ship \"lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dropship slowed and Polaski drifted, turned, and de- scended onto the surface of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Latch engaged,\" she said over the COM. \"All yours, Chief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred, Grace, and I will reconnoiter,\" he told Blue Team. \"Anton, Will, and Li, get ready to move the arc welder and hull plates we scavenged from the Gettysburg when we give the all-clear signal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn eased his boots onto the hull. Their magnetic soles clamped onto the metal with a satisfying click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski had landed the Covenant dropship so that its mandibles cradled the hole and gave them some shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, Slipspace was on fire. It looked as if someone had doused the night with jet fuel and ignited it. Bloody, boiling streaks of flame tore across a midnight-blue sky. Meteors flashed past and sprayed molten metal in trails of glittering Stardust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fist-sized projectile blurred past the Master Chief and rammed into the ship\u0027s starboard side. Sparks and liquefied alloy spattered into space. His shields flickered as debris ricocheted from the armor\u0027s protective field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to move fast. The Admiral was right: This was a shooting galley. The quicker they sealed that hole and got out of here—the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn turned and swept his rifle over the terrain. There were bumpy sensor nodes, kilometers of conduits, and a dozen gaping canyons in the hull. A legion of Covenant warriors could hide in this mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo enemy contact. Nothing on his motion sensors, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped close to the main-drive conduit and examined the hole. The pipe was five meters across and still red hot, even though Cortana had shut it down three minutes ago. The hole was round, a three-meter-wide gap, with ragged edges that all pointed inward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that was from a plasma strike,\" Grace said, \"the metal would have been boiled away. If it was from an impact, the edges would be scraped on one side, compacted on the other. This hole was deliberately made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eyes sharp,\" John said. \"We have company. My guess is camouflaged Elites. Maybe some of the original crew still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue-Three, -Four, and -Five—move out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger,\" Will replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton emerged from the dropship hefting an arc welder, while Will and Li maneuvered the three-by-three-meter hull plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred and Grace, you\u0027re on the welders,\" John ordered. \"Anton, post on top of the dropship. Li, you\u0027re at three o\u0027clock. Will at nine. I\u0027ll take the six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue acknowledgment lights winked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn helped Fred and Grace set the plates in position. Grace and Fred fired up the arc welder, and pinpoints of metal liquefied beneath their tips. A shower of sparks swirled around them in the evacuated environment like a swarm of fireflies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in position, Admiral,\" John reported. \"ETA for repairs is two minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger, Chief,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. Ionization made the channel flood with static. \"When you\u0027re done, give the word and get secure—we\u0027ll be accelerating immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, so good, John thought. Just another minute or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA streamer of plasma appeared from nowhere. The tangled, crisscrossed Slipspace around them dropped the bolt of boiling fire fifty meters overhead; it moved port to starboard—and van- ished back into the void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe COM shattered into white noise, and the motion sensors blurred. . . as did the active camouflage shielding of the six Elites who had been slowly—and until a moment ago imperceptibly— crawling toward their position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enemy contacts!\" John shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched behind the dome of a sensor node and opened fire. A hail of bullets caught the closest Elite dead-center in its chest. The gunfire punched through its shielding and then tore into its armor. It tumbled backward and spun off the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his peripheral vision John saw the silent muzzle flashes from his team. He glanced back; Fred and Grace hadn\u0027t moved. They stared at the beads of molten alloy under their arc welder\u0027s tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if Fred could read his mind, he said, \"I need another twenty seconds, Chief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA volley of crystalline needles fired from one of the Elites peppered the sensor node. The Master Chief returned fire, but the Elite\u0027s camouflage kicked in and it faded from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother plasma bolt sizzled close to the hull, this one thirty meters to port. It was a river of fire that lit the surface of Ascendant Justice like a dozen suns. John\u0027s shields drained to a quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Chief,\" Fred told him, \"I\u0027m—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Incoming!\" Polaski cried over the COM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn turned to the dropship and saw a third plasma projectile materialize from the folds of tangled Slipspace. This one skimmed a mere three meters over the hull—straight toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill dived into the crux where the dropship met the hull. Fred and Grace hit the deck. Li stood his ground and fired at the Elites, muzzle flash reflected in his helmet\u0027s faceplate. Anton rose from his limited cover on top of the dropship, but instinc- tively ducked again as an Elite took a shot at him. John crouched, jumped, and propelled himself into the sheltered area between the dropship\u0027s mandibles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plasma blasted over the dropship like a tidal wave of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski screamed, and her channel went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue-white light filled John\u0027s vision, and electrical discharges jolted his flesh and buzzed through his muscles and ligaments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemperature warnings blared. Boiling hydrostatic gel vented through his MJOLNIR armor\u0027s emergency ducts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough blurry eyes, John saw the Covenant Elites flash va- porize. Downship, Ascendant Justice\u0027s hull heated to a glowing yellow and softened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the light and heat vanished, and the torrent of fire trailed aft like the tail of a comet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn craned his neck up, every muscle in his body screaming in pain. There was no trace of Li or Anton. The dropship\u0027s hull was melted and distorted like a wax candle caught in a blow- torch\u0027s blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cockpit and Polaski were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis biosign warning blared. Will, Grace, and Fred lay next to him—dead or unconscious, he couldn\u0027t tell. He quickly attached their tethers to the deck, then clipped his own in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn keyed the COM. \"Admiral, conduit breach is sealed, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on, son,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. \"This might be a rough ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn slumped to the deck unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME:DATE RECORD [[ERROR]]ANOMALY\\Date\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnknown\\ Captured Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice, in anomalous Slipspace bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb stood on the bridge of Ascendant Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped the edges of the railing that encircled the central raised platform and watched the sea of fire on the wall displays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were stuck in this pocket of Slipspace, trapped like an insect in amber as lines of plasma crisscrossed the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnemy fire vanished and reappeared, smearing the blue fog of Slipspace with crimson streaks of glowing energy. Molten chunks of metal, the broken pieces of Covenant ships, streaked past the cameras—comets that thudded into their hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another danger in the blue fog: ghost ships that ap- peared and faded from sight... more than half of them disabled, engulfed in fire, or their hulls broken. How many of those Cove- nant craft were still capable of engaging Ascendant Justice\"!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many could they take out before they risked the jump back to normal space?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson stood next to him. The young man was invaluable for his tactical assessments and knowledge of the Covenant. He was a bit too cautious for Whitcomb\u0027s taste— though the trait was to be expected in an ONI officer, he sup- posed. Still, the young Lieutenant had shown enough backbone to stand up to him. The kid definitely had some potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA square on the holographic controls morphed into the tiny figure of Cortana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sporadic plasma and mass impacts along our hull, Admiral,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe reported and crossed her arms. \"Atmospheric integrity down ERIC NYLUNO 225 to thirteen percent. Structural integrity rated poor. I estimate the hull will fail in no more than five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood,\" the Admiral replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t have much choice but to play the hand that they\u0027d been dealt. The longer they stayed in this environment, the more damage the Covenant ships surrounding them incurred. If As- cendant Justice had engines, the Admiral could accelerate that process. But if they waited too long, their own ship would disintegrate around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb glanced up to see how the rest of his crew was holding up under the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocklear paced, his hands flexing. The ODST was a weapon with its safety permanently clicked off... and on overload charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Johnson stood near the sealed bulkhead, rifle slung over his shoulder. He was looking at the crew and probably for- mulating his own opinions about them. He was rock-solid. One glance into his dark eyes and the Admiral understood what drove the man: pure cold hatred of the enemy. The Admiral could ap- preciate that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey tended the Spartan called \"Kelly\" on the deck. The doctor was brilliant... but a total mystery to him. They had met half a dozen times before at upper-echelon social gatherings, and he\u0027d found her to be charming and outwardly likable. But he\u0027d read enough reports of her \"projects\" that he\u0027d found it impossible to relate to her. If half the rumors he\u0027d heard about her were true, she\u0027d been mixed up in every black op from here to Andromeda. He didn\u0027t trust her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor Halsey,\" the Admiral said. He released his grip on the railing and clasped his hands behind his back to conceal his sweaty palms. \"Clear my bridge of the wounded, ASAP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey looked up from her data pad and the fluctuating patterns of Kelly\u0027s biosigns. \"Admiral, I don\u0027t want to move her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe not entirely stable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it, Doctor. She\u0027s a distraction. We have a battle to fight here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey shot him a look that could have stopped a plasma bolt dead in its tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson stepped forward and cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am, there\u0027s an escape craft just off the bridge.\" He moved to the starboard hatch and eased it open. He drew his pistol and checked the passage beyond. \"It\u0027s clear. Locklear, Sergeant, please give the doctor a hand with her patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Locklear said. \"Happy to sit this battle out in the escape pod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Johnson set his rifle on Kelly\u0027s chest and said, \"Come on, Corporal, shake a leg and gimme a hand. The lady in her armor weighs more than your last date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocklear and the Sergeant hefted Kelly and, grunting under the load, moved her off the bridge. Dr. Halsey followed, cast one last withering look at the Admiral, and sealed the hatch behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb sighed. He felt for the Spartan... felt too much—which was the problem. He couldn\u0027t concentrate with her so close. He\u0027d want constant status reports on her condition. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-30.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
