She\u0027d witnessed his temper tantrums. She wasn\u0027t going to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Peter asked. \"You\u0027ve gone pale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" she said. Peter turned to go back to the party, and she called after him, \"Tell Giovanni I\u0027ll talk to him later. I\u0027m leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to hurry, Allison. I\u0027m here now.\" Brett spoke from right behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to run for the doors, but Brett anticipated the move and latched onto her upper arm. He jerked her around to face him. They were the only two in the dressing room. Everyone else had gone to the party. There wasn\u0027t anyone to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glowed with his hatred. \"You\u0027re coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to fix this mess you created. You stole everything from me. I want you to give it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stole from you?\" She was so astonished by his absurd remark she had to pause for a second. \"You tried to take my work and pass it off as your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed her arm even harder until she cried out. \"I ordered a new car, and now I can\u0027t pay for it, and I bought a condo down in South Beach, but they want the money or the deal is off, and I don\u0027t have any money because of you. You took all that from me, and you\u0027re going to give it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe how he could justify his actions. \"You think saying it\u0027s yours makes it yours? I\u0027m not giving you my work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s mine. I worked on that program for a long time, and you can\u0027t prove I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re delirious. You\u0027ll never get away with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see panic overtaking him. He shook her hard. She was surprised by his strength. \"You humiliated me in front of my peers and my investor,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean Stiles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I mean Stiles. He\u0027s going to see I followed through on my promise to make us millions. I shouldn\u0027t have gone to him. . . . I shouldn\u0027t have asked him for money, but I didn\u0027t realize how dangerous he was, and now . . . Please, Allison.\" His bravado was beginning to vanish and now he just sounded pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me,\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I need is the missing code, and you have to give it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett was desperate. He\u0027d gotten in over his head and now he was drowning. \"No.\" She tried to peel his hand away, but he wouldn\u0027t let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have buyers,\" he said. \"I can make it worth your while. Just let me have the whole program, and I\u0027ll give you a cut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked desperate. \"You\u0027re coming with me, and you\u0027re giving me the entire program. He\u0027ll kill me if I don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to drag me out of here, and there are two men outside who aren\u0027t going to let you do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen them. You don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t planned a way out?\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In about five seconds I\u0027m going to start screaming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to do this,\" he said. He pulled a pistol out of his pocket and showed it to her before putting it back, with his hand on the trigger and the barrel pointing at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get that gun?\" She was so shocked she could barely think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stiles gave it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, Brett. You aren\u0027t a killer. You need to get away from him,\" she said. \"And get rid of that gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe acted as though he hadn\u0027t heard a word she\u0027d said. \"I swear I\u0027m going to shoot you if you don\u0027t get moving. If I can\u0027t have that program, you\u0027re not going to be able to sell it, either. I don\u0027t have any problem killing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed the gun into her side and pushed her toward the doors that led to the garden. She opened the doors, took a step through them, and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move,\" Brett ordered as he gave a shove to her ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Brett,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Making my life miserable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re about to get shot. I imagine it\u0027s going to hurt like the blazes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett took a step forward, and that was when he saw Liam standing outside the door with his gun drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my way,\" Brett shouted. \"I\u0027m not going to hurt her. We\u0027re just going to work on our program, and I\u0027m driving her home.\" He was scrambling for words, his hand still on his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of her and put your hands up,\" Liam ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett shook his head and pulled Allison closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a gun,\" she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Liam\u0027s voice was calm and steady. \"Put your hands up,\" he repeated. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-107.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
