With Nether Limitless added on, there were over 10,000 martial artists from the Skydark Holy Lands present, of which 8000-9000 were juniors.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe First Martial Meeting was a wild scene that caused everyone to go crazy with emotion. Let alone these martial artists that often resorted to violence to solve all of their problems, even in mortal nations, there was likely to be riots after kickball matches. Once the fans of these kickball matches rose up, it wasn’t strange if dozens or hundreds of people were trampled to death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe 8000-9000 junior disciples of the Skydark Holy Lands were roused into a frothing rage. Even the other martial artists from the Demondawn Great World were going mad. They originally had disciples attending the semifinals, but now that they had all been eliminated, Nether Limitless was the only one to come from their great world. Since they had the closest relations with them, they naturally had to support Nether Limitless.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Daochild slightly opened his eyes, faintly frowning. His figure moved and he flew over the chaotic part of the arena. A great pressure suddenly came crashing down from the skies, and all of those mad spectators were forced down by this pressure, immediately subdued. Otherwise, with billions of people in the audience and all of them formidable geniuses of their era, once a riot occurred, let alone Xiao Daochild, not even a Great World King would be able to suppress them.

The Ancient Phoenix Clan only had several hundred disciples present, but every disciple was shouting as loudly as they could!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming will win!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Senior-apprentice Brother Lin is unstoppable!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhether or not they believed Lin Ming could win at this time, none of them would weaken their momentum!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd in fact, with this sort of scene at the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting that involved the very honor of a sect, it was easy for others to be infected with the atmosphere. At this time, they simply didn’t care if Lin Ming would win. Rather, they would all do their best to maintain the honor of their sect. Making sure that their own side had the greatest momentum was the most important matter right now!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Nether Limitless isn’t willing to admit that his own talent is inferior to Lin Ming’s, but the truth is already placed right in front of him. But, what he said is also correct. Lin Ming’s current strength is lacking and he might not be able to win. But, after one or two years have passed, Lin Ming will likely surpass Nether Limitless. Out of the four people, Lin Ming is the youngest and his future is also the brightest!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA clear-headed spectator commented. There were many Elders and juniors that weren’t related to either Lin Ming or Nether Limitless, and they were calmly discussing the situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Heh, Nether Limitless absolutely cannot lose this match.

Suddenly, something strange occurred. Every three steps that Nether Limitless walked forwards, he would leave behind a shadow. This shadow was a complete copy of Nether Limitless; all of them held a katana in their hands and all of them had an extremely dangerous aura. This was not an afterimage left behind by moving too fast. Rather, Nether Limitless was moving at an extremely slow speed, just like a normal mortal walking. Even so, he left behind three remnant shadows, making it seem as if there were four of him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Avatar technique?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No, that is the Space Laws!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNether Limitless had extremely high attainments in the Space and Time Laws. And, once one perceived the Space Laws to a certain degree, they could create spatial mirror projections.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese mirror images were different from illusions – they had true striking power. According to one’s understanding of the Space Laws, their striking power could vary between 10% to 100% of the main body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf one could reach 100% reproduction, then that was a perfect mirror image. If one could reach the peak in this aspect, their mirror images would even inherit the Laws, martial skills, combat experience, and memories of the original. That was a truly incomprehensible boundary.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, an important factor was that these mirror images did not fear attacks. Shattering a mirror image wasn’t difficult, but doing so cost true essence, and these mirror images could even be reformed afterwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s actually spatial mirror images.

The Space and Time Laws are known as second amongst the most difficult Laws to comprehend. He is so young and yet he has managed to perceive them to such a degree. This really makes us older generation martial artists feel useless!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the Divine Seal Altar, Lin Ming now had to battle four opponents!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFour Nether Limitlesses simultaneously attacked!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFour swords slashed out together.

His ability to fuse Laws together was truly praiseworthy!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just this Drifting Snow of 8000 Miles, every single snowflake contained Laws and Concepts. If these snowflakes touched someone, they could even freeze a Life Destruction martial artist to death. With millions and billions of snowflakes falling down, it could kill all living creatures for thousands of miles!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo Nether Limitless, this was his ultimate killing move. He had originally planned to use it at the finals of the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting, but now he was forced by Lin Ming to show his hand here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing this strike, Lin Ming pointed his long spear to the ground.

An ancient and boundless power erupted. As those endless snowflakes fell into the grandmist space, all of them began to melt away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUsing the grandmist space was something that Lin Ming had already consulted with Mo Eversnow about and decided on before the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting had begun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing these countless masters of the Divine Realm, as well as the unfathomably deep Empyrean descendants, he would need to use the grandmist space sooner or later. Otherwise, there was no chance that Lin Ming would win. After all, he was only at the early Divine Sea realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf he failed to blossom in the First Martial Meeting, he wouldn’t be able to enter Vast Universe Heavenly Palace, let alone study the Divine Dream Law from Empyrean Divine Dream. To study the Divine Dream Law was something that Lin Ming desperately wished for.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the grandmist space was camouflaged with Mo Eversnow’s technique, even a World King wouldn’t be able to see through it. The only chance was if they had seen Empyrean Primordius use the grandmist space with their own eyes in the past. But, Empyrean Primordius was someone with a similar status to Empyrean Divine Dream. And just how mysterious was Empyrean Divine Dream? Even if one became the champion of the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting and reached first place on the Heaven Proclamation, they still wouldn’t be able to see her!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven an ordinary World King or Great World King did not have the chance to see her! And wanting to see Empyrean Divine Dream display her full strength was an even greater impossibility. Only a similar Empyrean level character would be able to see her strength with their own eyes!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn other words, unless one was an Empyrean level existence similar to Empyrean Primordius, then even an Empyrean chief disciple like Vast Cosmos wouldn’t be able to recognize the camouflaged grandmist space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePerhaps the grandmist space being recognized by an Empyrean was an inevitability. But, Lin Ming believed that these characters would certainly know of the great war 100,000 years ago, when Empyrean Primordius had waged a cataclysmic war with Empyrean Thunder Punishment and other peerless powerhouses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis war had involved countless masters of the Divine Realm, and had likely even included God Beasts. It was even likely that Empyrean Primordius or Empyrean Thunder Punishment had perished because of this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow could such a great matter not be known by other Empyreans?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey should also have guessed that Empyrean Primordius had left his inheritance within the Sky Spill Continent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, the reason that they turned a blind eye to all this definitely wasn’t simple at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn other words, those that could recognize the grandmist space would also know about Empyrean Primordius’s inheritance. As for those that couldn’t recognize the grandmist space, they wouldn’t know anything at all, so letting them see the grandmist space wasn’t a big deal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDrawing back 10,000 steps, even if someone coveted the transcendent divine might known as the Primordius martial intent, it was still impossible for them to take it away from Lin Ming, because Lin Ming didn’t have a jade slip at all. Even if they caught Lin Ming and searched his soul they would still find nothing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was indeed danger, but Lin Ming had to make a desperate gamble no matter what.

He burst forwards, his speed reaching the limit as he directly tore apart that curtain of endless snow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnderneath Nether Limitless’s control, the millions of snowflakes swirled together, gathering into a massive white tornado that swept towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, Lin Ming remained unstoppable, breaking through everything!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the grandmist space, he had wiped away the increased striking power from Nether Limitless’s Space Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, with his Concept of Virtual Fire that he comprehended by truly stepping into the fifth level of the Fire Laws, he completely nullified Nether Limitless’s Drifting Snow of 8000 Miles!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith both of them being elemental Laws, when the fifth level Concept of Fire was compared to the fourth level Concept of Water, it was obvious which was stronger and which was weaker!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s spear broke through Nether Limitless’s pervasive sword light, immediately reaching his front!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith four Nether Limitlesses present, an ordinary martial artist would be hard-pressed to differentiate them. But, to Lin Ming this was not a problem at all. When the grandmist space came shrouding down, the energy of the spatial mirror images had been suppressed, and even seemed on the verge of dissipating. Although he wasn’t able to cause the mirror images to completely collapse, it was still enough for Lin Ming to separate out Nether Limitless’s true body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Phoenix Blood Spear aimed straight towards the true Nether Limitless’s chest.

As Lin Ming’s strike hit Nether Limitless, it caused all of the anger and jealousy within him to expand to the limit, becoming increasingly wild and intense, as if Nether Limitless’s body would soon burn away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis eyes turned blood red; his body would explode at any moment!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You’ve lost!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnderneath the rules of this competition and with Xiao Daochild watching from the side, it was impossible for Lin Ming to kill.
