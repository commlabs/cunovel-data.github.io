This dress was designed for someone with your body type. It’s perfect. It arrived this afternoon, almost as though I’d sent away for it with you in mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Julia murmured. The woman held up the gown for her inspection. It was lovely, ten times more elaborate than the one she’d tried on earlier. Ten times more beautiful, too. It was the kind of dress a woman in love would choose, knowing her groom would treasure its beauty. Would treasure her beauty. A groom who’d cherish her devotion all his life. It was the style of dress she would’ve worn for Roger before she learned of his betrayal. Before she’d learned what a fool she’d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to argue, but one look convinced her that the woman would hear none of it. Not exactly sure why she’d allowed this stranger to dictate her actions, Julia put on the dress. The silk and taffeta rustled as it slid effortlessly over her hips. She kept her eyes lowered as she turned around and the shopkeeper fastened the small pearl closures down her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia felt strangely reluctant to look into a mirror, almost fearing her own reflection. When she did raise her eyes to the glass, she was startled at the beautiful young woman who gazed back at her. It took her a wild second to realize it was herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGone were the lines that told of the bitterness and disappointment she’d carried with her since her father’s death. The cool, disinterested look in her eyes had warmed. The calculating side of her personality faded, replaced by the woman she’d been before she’d fallen in love with Roger Stanhope. Open, trusting, naive—too young for her years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to look at herself any longer, Julia dragged her eyes away from the graceful reflection of the woman she’d once been. The woman Roger’s deception had destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s perfect,” the saleswoman was saying with a sigh of appreciation. “Just perfect. It’s as if the dress was meant for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia opened her mouth to contradict the woman, but before she could voice her objection she looked at the mirror one last time. A few days earlier she’d caught a stormy glimpse of herself reflected in her office window. She’d disliked what she’d seen, the woman she’d become, cold, uncaring and driven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d quickly abandoned her self-analysis and had concentrated on what was happening with Alek and Jerry at the Immigration office instead. The events of that afternoon had resulted in this farce of a wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek had been adamant that there be no divorce. Julia had agreed to those terms, but not in the spirit he’d intended. If it weren’t for these particular circumstances, Julia doubted she would ever have married. This would be her only wedding, her one chance to wear such a beautiful gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take it,” she said, calling herself a fool even as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Somehow I knew you would.” The saleswoman grinned broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took an additional twenty minutes, while the dress was wrapped up and the bill paid, before Julia was able to leave the shop. Nervously she glanced at her watch as she headed toward her parked car. She was already late and knew Ruth would be worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs often as she’d visited hospitals, Julia could never accustom herself to the antiseptic smell. She rushed down the polished hallway to the wing that housed her grandmother. She hated the thought of Ruth being here, away from her comfortable home and the pictures she loved and kept close to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth had tried repeatedly to prepare Julia for her death, but Julia refused to listen, refused to accept life without her adored grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecking in at the nurses’ station, Julia was left to wait until Velma Williams, the head nurse, returned. A striking arrangement of red, blue, yellow and white flowers overfilled an inverted straw hat on a corner of the long counter. Julia admired it as she stood there. A few minutes later, Velma was back and Julia was ushered to Ruth’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good afternoon,” Julia whispered. She couldn’t tell if Ruth was sleeping or simply resting her eyes. Her grandmother seemed to be doing more of both lately. There were various tubes and pieces of equipment attached to Ruth’s body, monitoring her heart and administering drugs intravenously. Julia looked down on this woman she loved so much and had to force back her growing sense of alarm. It seemed to ring in her ears, announcing that the time was fast approaching when Ruth would no longer be with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman’s eyes gradually drifted open. “Julia, my dear, I’m so glad you’re here. Come, sit with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia pulled up a chair and sat next to the high hospital bed. “How are you feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth gestured weakly with her hand. “That’s not important now. Tell me about you and Alek. How I’ve prayed for this day. How I’ve hoped you’d learn to love again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The wedding’s on Friday afternoon.” Julia half suspected her grandmother would find the timing suspicious, but instead Ruth smiled tenderly and a faraway look came into her tired eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friday… It’s a good thing you won’t have a long engagement, because I doubt I’ll last more than a week or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma, please don’t say that. You’re going to be around for years and years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weary smile didn’t waver. “I won’t see my great-grandchildren.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia wanted to argue with her, but she couldn’t; there’d never be children for her and Alek because there would never be a real marriage. She suffered a slight twinge of guilt but pushed it aside as a luxury she couldn’t afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry I’m late but I was trying on wedding dresses,” Julia explained, injecting some enthusiasm into her voice. She was mildly surprised at how little effort it required to sound excited about the dress she’d bought at the bridal shop. She described it in detail and was pleased at the way her grandmother’s eyes brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and Alek will come see me after the ceremony, won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Julia promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth motioned toward the nurses’ station. “He sent me flowers. He’s a very thoughtful boy. Velma carried in the bouquet for me to see. Did you notice them?” “Who sent you flowers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your Alek. An enchanting arrangement, and such a sweet thing to do. I like him, Julia. You’ve chosen well, my dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia was uncomfortable talking about Alek. He’d been foremost in her thoughts all day and she wanted to escape him, escape the memory of his gentle kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about your romance. You’ve been so close-mouthed about it all…yet I knew.” Ruth’s eyes closed slowly and she sighed. With what seemed to be a good deal of effort she opened her eyes again. “He’s a special man, that one. Just hearing about you two gladdens my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah…” Julia hesitated, not sure what to say. “It all happened rather quickly…almost overnight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I gathered.” A spark appeared in Ruth’s eyes. “Oh, how I adore a love story. Tell me more before I fall back asleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alek’s green card was about to expire.” Keeping everything as close to the truth as possible made this much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His green card,” Ruth repeated. “Of course, I’d forgotten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was going to have to return to Russia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you realized you couldn’t let that happen, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hadn’t realized how important he was to me,” Julia said, adding drama to her voice. “Jerry did everything he could to persuade the Immigration people to let Alek stay, but nothing he said convinced them. The three of us were talking and suddenly I understood how vital it was to me that Alek remain in the United States. I…don’t think I could bear to go on without him.” This was a stretch, but Julia knew what a romantic her grandmother was. If she was exaggerating the truth just a little, it was a small price to pay to satisfy Ruth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julia, my sweet child.” Her grandmother’s delicate hand reached for Julia’s and she squeezed her fingers. “I always trusted that in time you’d open your heart to love again. It took a special man like Alek. Be happy, my child. Promise me you won’t let go until you’ve found your joy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia wasn’t sure she understood Ruth’s words. They made little sense to her. She would have questioned her if Ruth hadn’t chosen that moment to slip into a peaceful slumber. For several minutes Julia remained at her grandmother’s side, taking in the solace she felt whenever she spent time with Ruth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julia.” The sound of her name, said with that soft European accent, caught her attention. She jerked around to find Alek standing in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up abruptly, resenting his intrusion into these quiet moments. She walked toward the door, not wanting him to interrupt her grandmother’s rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?” she asked when they were well into the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edge of his mouth lifted in a half smile. “I came to see you. There is much we need to discuss.” He tucked her hand in the crook of his elbow and sauntered over to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I left the wedding arrangements in Jerry’s hands. He’ll look after everything. As far as I can see, there’s nothing to discuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the anger in him, in the prideful squaring of his shoulders and the way his mouth thinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me, Julia, and you need me. I just wonder how long it will take before you realize this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrogance of the man was beyond description. She glared at him. She needed no one, especially a man, and never a husband. She wanted to shout out the words, but a hospital corridor was the last place to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong seconds passed as they stared into each other’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need me,” he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wrong,” she returned defiantly. Conrad Industries needed him; she didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes lingered and it seemed neither of them knew what to say or do next. Jerry had mentioned how proud Alek was, and she could see that colossal ego for herself. He released her arm and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was several yards down the hospital corridor before Julia spoke. “I don’t need you, Alek,” she called after him. She had to say something. They’d quickly make each other miserable if this friction between them continued. If he wouldn’t make an effort, then it was up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’ve already said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I am willing to admit we need each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, he turned back. His smile grew as he returned to her side. For a heartbeat, he said nothing. Then he lowered his mouth to hers and kissed her. His touch was as gentle as before. Light as air, it left her wondering if she’d imagined his kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you do that?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was worth waiting for. “Because, my soon-to-be-wife, you deserved it.” He brushed the hair away from her face. “For that matter,” he said with a roguish grin, “so did I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-5.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
