The Mountain and Sea Realm belonged to Meng Hao, but was destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hope of the Realm was with the butterfly, which had now reached the green coffin within the black hole of the vortex. Upon its fluttering wings, countless faces could be seen, looking disconsolately toward the Vast Expanse outside of the black hole, almost as if they hoped to see Meng Hao off in the distance, even though they couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, the Vast Expanse was very quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s vision was blurred, and he was on the brink of completely losing consciousness. By now, the voices and sounds in his ear seemed distorted and stretched out, as if they were reaching him from long ago or far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the parrot hadn’t just called out in its shrill voice, he would already have closed his eyes completely. Instead, he forced them open. He could sense the madness of the mastiff, the sorrow of the meat jelly, and the pain of the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA weak smile appeared on Meng Hao’s face, although it was a smile of regret and apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t mind me... you... are all free now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he spoke those words, the mastiff trembled, threw its head back, and roared. Then it latched its teeth onto his garment, as if it knew that releasing Meng Hao would mean parting from him for all time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meat jelly was in a similar frenzy. It was pouring all of its life force, all of its being, into Meng Hao. Although its body was rapidly turning a dull gray, it refused to give up in its attempt to keep Meng Hao alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing bitterly, the parrot looked around at the Vast Expanse, and then its eyes gradually filled with determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was now surrounded by countless cultivators from the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent. The destruction of the Mountain and Sea Realm had affected these two forces in a profound way. The land masses were riddled with cracks, and were it not for the deeply profound resources they had at their disposal, they would have likely collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the 9-Essences experts approached, the parrot flew out, eyes gleaming with decisiveness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not fleeing or hiding like it usually did. As it flew out, dazzling, multi-colored light began to shine out from it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe copper mirror appeared behind it, ancient and primitive in appearance. It radiated a feeling of profound mystery, as though it contained innumerable secrets, secrets which could drive people mad, and make the mirror the focus of all creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the parrot let out a shrill cry as it glared at the surrounding cultivators. Then, it glanced out at the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot’s cry caused the surrounding cultivators’ faces to flicker, especially the 9-Essences experts. Their faces fell completely as they sensed that because of the parrot’s shrill cry, the copper mirror was... cracking!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter watching the Mountain and Sea Realm be destroyed, and seeing the choices that Meng Hao had made, the parrot was filled with mixed emotions. In fact, it almost couldn\u0027t even face Meng Hao now, because as far as it was concerned, the reason all of these calamities had occurred was itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it weren’t for me, the Mountain and Sea Realm wouldn’t have been destroyed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it weren’t for me, Haowie wouldn’t be dying....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it weren\u0027t for me, none of this would have happened....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The meat jelly was right. I\u0027m the reason for all of this. I\u0027m immoral. I\u0027m wrong. I... shouldn’t even exist.” The parrot laughed bitterly, and the mirror crumbled. The surrounding cultivators were flabbergasted, and the 9-Essences experts immediately began to rush toward the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren’t the only ones. Ancient auras which existed on the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent immediately shot out to fill the area around the copper mirror in an attempt to prevent it from exploding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, their cultivation levels seemed insufficient to prevent that from happening. No matter what any of them did to attempt to stop the process, the self-detonation which had been initiated by the parrot and the copper mirror could not be halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the parrot drew everyone’s attention, the meat jelly, who was still covering Meng Hao and delivering its life force to him, was staring at the parrot and trembling. But then, it suddenly seemed to hear words being spoken to it, a message from the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are you doing? Get out of here!!\u003c/em\u003e The message was not transmitted by divine sense, nor was it spoken audibly. It was a feeling, a sensation that came from the connection formed between the meat jelly and parrot after all their years together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meat jelly smiled bitterly, but didn\u0027t hesitate for even a moment. It understood that the parrot, which it had pestered and argued with throughout so many lives, had chosen to die. It was dying, sacrificing itself, to buy time so that the meat jelly... could protect Meng Hao... and take him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haowie, you\u0027ve treated me so well...” the meat jelly said, smiling. Many chaotic memories flashed through the meat jelly’s mind, and there were even images that didn\u0027t seem to be its own memories. Usually, it chose to suppress such memories, to ignore them. It preferred to mindlessly argue with the parrot, to chatter endlessly at Meng Hao, to haughtily act like it was ancient and wise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, after seeing the decision being made by the parrot, the meat jelly smiled, and unleashed a warm and gentle light. As the light spread out, it transformed into a shocking power of teleportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstonishingly, it was drawing upon its full life force to summon an incredibly powerful teleportation magic. It was a teleportation that would whisk Meng Hao away safely, but the price to be paid was the meat jelly’s life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the type of teleportation that the meat jelly would normally never even think to utilize. But right now, with Meng Hao hovering on the verge of death, and the parrot having made its choice, the meat jelly had made its choice, completely willingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor ran through Meng Hao. He was now wavering back and forth between unconsciousness and lucidity. He could see the anguish of the parrot, and could sense what the meat jelly was doing. He couldn’t stop the shaking which wracked him. He wanted to stop them, but couldn\u0027t open his mouth. His injuries were too severe, and he could do absolutely nothing to prevent any of it from happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled up in his eyes, and his crimson pupils were seas of anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My friends....” he muttered, and yet only he could hear those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as the meat jelly’s teleportation light exploded out. The cultivators of the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent could both sense what was happening, and sent one stream of will to stop the parrot and copper mirror, and another to prevent the meat jelly from completing the teleportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mastiff howled and leaped forward to intervene, but was completely incapable of fighting the incoming stream of will. Blood sprayed out of its mouth, and it was sent tumbling back. And yet, it tenaciously stuck by Meng Hao’s side to protect him. As for the stream of will, its target was the meat jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that the parrot\u0027s self-detonation process paused momentarily, and it cried out in a shrill that shook Heaven and Earth: “Let him go!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let him go!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let him leave this place! Lord Fifth is willing... perform the mind erasure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you people want the copper mirror. Lord Fifth also knows that none of you can separate me from it. So today, I\u0027m willing to be erased!” Even in this moment, the parrot still didn’t forget to call itself Lord Fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you people don\u0027t want Lord Fifth to destroy the mirror, let him go, otherwise... I’ll blow it up, and none of you will ever lay a hand on it!!” The parrot\u0027s shrill squawk caused the hearts of all the surrounding cultivators to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot almost seemed worried that they wouldn’t believe him. In that moment, it began to crumble into pieces. Its spirit and its mind fell apart. Just as it said, it was willing to allow its mind and thoughts to be erased, willing to no longer be a sentient entity. Instead, its mind would become... a spirit automaton!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that happened, the stream of will which was attempting to grab the meat jelly and Meng Hao suddenly stopped in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when the unleashing of the meat jelly’s teleportation power reached its climax. The meat jelly itself turned completely gray as it lost all of its life force. It, together with Meng Hao, began to grow blurry. Then, rumbling sounds echoed out as the process of teleportation began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that, all of a sudden, the rugged, muscular man from the Devil Realm shot toward Meng Hao, his eyes flashing. His target was not Meng Hao, though, but his bag of holding. Earlier, Meng Hao had pulled Su Yan out to threaten him, and she was still inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat muscular man’s hatred toward Meng Hao for his treatment of Su Yan had turned into profound killing intent. At this moment, he neared the teleportation perimeter, then reached his hand out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop them!!” a voice cried out. The approaching stream of will began to emanate ripples, but at the same time, the parrot’s entire body burst into flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the muscular man reached his hand out, the power of teleportation erupted out. Rumbling could be heard, and in almost the exact same instant, Meng Hao and the meat jelly vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscular man’s hand latched down onto nothing but thin air. He stamped his foot angrily, and looked up, his eyes completely bloodshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the parrot chuckled. Its mind was fading, and the last thing it saw was Meng Hao vanish. Its eyes glimmered with the reluctance to part ways, with well wishes, and with an emotional sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll probably never meet again....” it murmured. Then it closed its eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, it opened its eyes again, and within the dazzling, multi-colored light that surrounded it, what people saw was no longer a garish parrot, but rather... the copper mirror spirit automaton, emanating a supreme Dao and the aura of a Paragon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts eyes were cold, so cold that they seemed capable of freezing the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, of burying all memories and thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shocking pressure radiated out in all directions, causing all hearts to tremble. Even the 9-Essences experts were shaken, and the rugged, muscular man felt fear rise up in his heart when the mighty gaze of the parrot fell on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if that gaze could read all thoughts and see through all hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gaze was above all else, like the most supreme of beings. It was like the ruler of the Vast Expanse, that could look down upon all life, which would then prostrate in worship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind it was the copper mirror, which radiated a boundless, supreme aura. Ripples spread out into the Vast Expanse, which then transformed into a vortex. All of the cultivators present couldn’t help but feel a sense of complete and utter awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA profoundly cold and ancient voice then spoke from the parrot\u0027s mouth: “I come from the Vast Expanse Society. I have traveled through tens upon tens of thousands of worlds....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me... your wish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote from Deathblade: \u003c/strong\u003eThere was a passage some of you might remember from \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-8-chapter-1325/\"\u003echapter 1325\u003c/a\u003e in which Meng Hao mused about the parrot/copper mirror being able to end the war.
