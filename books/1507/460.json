They saw Meng Hao standing there atop of the rock, his hair whipping about, his face expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes shone with a bright light as he suddenly teleported from atop the rock to reappear about thirty meters away from the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao made a slight noise of surprise. He had originally intended to teleport directly next to the clump of glowing Celestial soil. His appearance in this location seemed to indicate that something had interfered with his minor teleportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost the same instant that Meng Hao reappeared, one of the seven, a ruddy-faced old man, gave a cold harrumph. He waved his right hand, causing a red sea to magically appear. It shot up into the air and then began to descend as a red rain which roared toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since I can’t teleport, well….” A bloody glow suddenly rose up around Meng Hao. It flickered, and then Meng Hao disappeared. Shockingly, when he reappeared, he was directly in front of the ruddy-faced old man. The speed with which he moved was astonishing, causing the old man’s pupils to constrict. He fell back, raising his right hand up to summon another red sea. It almost looked like a sea of blood as it roiled around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA booming sound filled the air as Meng Hao shot forward. Eyeless Larva silk whizzed around him, emanating a silver glow. It sliced into the incoming red sea, blocking it completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruddy-faced old man’s face flickered and he continued to back up. Unfortunately, he was too slow. Meng Hao’s hand formed into a fist which slammed out into the air. The motion caused a violent windstorm to rise up and sweep out in all directions. Facing up against this attack, the old man’s hands flickered in an incantation, causing his totem tattoos to begin to glow as he attempted to defend himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of an explosion ripped out, and blood sprayed from the mouth of the old man. His expression was one of astonishment as he continued to retreat, obviously incapable of blocking Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao ignored the man and instead headed back toward the group of people, obviously intent on taking the Celestial soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, none of these people were capable of ignoring Meng Hao. Everything that had happened just now had occurred with incredible speed. The fact that Meng Hao had just forced a Nascent Soul Cultivator to retreat left them filled with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the two mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators were frowning. Unfortunately, they were at a critical point in the battle. The clump of Celestial soil was right next to them, and neither was able to snatch it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill that man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exterminate him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men actually yelled out at exactly the same time, simultaneously unleashing divine abilities on each other. One of them summoned a violet crocodile. As for the other, a white crane materialized next to him. The two continued to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the four others who were fighting around them, they didn’t hesitate for a moment. They all suddenly changed directions and shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the four neared, the Wood character on Meng Hao’s forehead flickered. Suddenly, an enormous tree appeared around him, which in turn was covered with shapeless flames that shot up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disseminate!” Meng Hao’s hands flashed an incantation, then jerked his arms out wide. A flame sea roared into being, with Meng Hao at its center. It roiled out in all directions, setting everything aflame. Within the manifestations of Meng Hao’s Wood- and Fire-type totems, golden droplets suddenly became visible. The flame sea continued to spread out, filled with the shocking power of Metal-, Wood-, and Fire-type totems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis four opponents’ faces flickered, and they used various methods in response. Next to one, an enormous Xuanwu turtle appeared. Another waved his hand, causing a red gigantic centipede to roar into being next him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the other two, each of them caused a howling Cyclops to magically appear to fight the flame sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flame sea was like an enormous mouth, waiting to sweep over the four and consume them, and the roaring it caused was shocking. It swept over the Xuanwu turtle, which let out a miserable shriek as its body was ripped into pieces. The Nascent Soul Cultivator controlling it tumbled backward, blood spraying from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the gigantic centipede, it was actually fire-resistant. However, when the golden droplets hit it, it was transformed into a golden statue, which was then melted by the flames. The Cultivator controlling it was astonished to find that his entire arm had turned the color of gold. An immense pressure weighed down on him that seemed capable of turning his body to gold in an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the two Cyclopses, their screams were the most wretched of all as their bodies were torn to shreds. The fragments were then transformed into gold, which then evaporated into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time Meng Hao had truly unleashed the full power of his three great totems. As soon as the magic spread out, the four Nascent Soul Cultivators were forced to retreat, coughing up blood the entire time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s body turned into a long beam that whistled through the air amidst the flame sea. The fire stretched out behind him almost like a cloak. The golden droplets and the flaming tree seemed like decorations on the cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you could paint a picture of the scene, Meng Hao’s imposing manner would be shocking to the extreme!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene shook the two mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators. They glanced at each other, and simultaneously stopped fighting. Instead, they unleashed their divine abilities in the direction of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators were beyond the compare of the early Nascent Stage Cultivators from moments ago. Both the fearsome totemic crocodile and the gigantic white crane instantly shot toward Meng Hao, emanating ferocious auras that mixed with the crushing weight of the mid Nascent Soul Stage to descend onto Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered. Moments ago, he had been watching these people fighting over the Celestial soil while he flew along on top of the two thousand meter large rock. During that time, he had already formulated a plan for how to achieve his objective, which was not to kill these people, but to snatch the Celestial soil!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the two mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators neared, Meng Hao waved his right hand, causing ripples to suddenly emanate out. They instantly turned black in color, and then solidified into the first streamer of the flag of three streamers. Ji Nineteen was temporarily unbound as the streamer shot out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flag of three streamers was the most powerful magical item that Meng Hao possessed. When it appeared, the sky grew dim. The violet-robed man’s face fell, and he immediately retreated. Unfortunately, despite flashing incantations, employing various divine abilities and producing magical items, he was incapable of fighting back against the sweeping blackness which shot toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom echoed out, and blood sprayed from the man’s mouth. Killing intent, but also shock, filled his eyes as he was flung backward several hundred meters before finally being able to come to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Meng Hao continued forward at top speed. Lifting his hand toward the white-robed Cultivator, he suddenly pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the Demon Sealing Hex appeared, the white-robed man’s expression flickered. Countless strands rose up that only Meng Hao could see. They immediately bound the man up, completely sealing him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the sealing would not last for very long, only the space of a single breath. However… that was all the time Meng Hao needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he shot forward toward the Celestial Soil, the surrounding seven Nascent Soul Cultivators all watched on, eyes filled with killing intent and even more so, anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was at this exact moment that ripples suddenly appeared in the middle of the air not too far off. A figure appeared, a young man wearing a long black robe. His head was unusually small and completely out of proportion with the rest of his body. He looked somewhat like a rat; his expression was somber, and his eyes glowed with bloodthirstiness. Laughing evilly, he shot forward with speed that exceeded Meng Hao’s, heading directly toward the Celestial soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been using some special technique to remain hidden in the area, undetectable. He had originally planned to wait until the two fighting parties were at a deadlock, and then suddenly make a move and wipe them all out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Meng Hao showed up. The way he swept the people aside was shocking, but also opened up a chance for this young man. Without hesitation, he made a decisive move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many thanks, Fellow Daoist!” cried the small-headed Cultivator. “It would be impolite for Yi Chenzi to turn down a gift like this Celestial soil!” As he reached out to grab ahold of it, killing intent flickered in Meng Hao’s eyes. The Eyeless Larva suddenly flew out. Its silk began to wrap around the clump of Celestial soil at the exact same time that the Cultivator Yi Chenzi grabbed onto it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bang could be heard as the finger-sized clump of Celestial soil suddenly split into two pieces. One was dragged back toward Meng Hao by the Eyeless Larva, the other was grabbed by Yi Chenzi, who immediately turned and shot off in the other direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the seven Nascent Soul Cultivators saw the small-headed Yi Chenzi, their expressions immediately filled with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yi Chenzi!” \u003ca id\u003d\"footnoteref-1\" href\u003d\"#footnote-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Yi Chenzi, the guy who betrayed and then slaughtered the entire Gryphon Tribe!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! He’s evil to the core! I heard he made living sacrifices of his own Clan to further his cultivation!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao grabbed the Celestial soil and then slapped his bag of holding to produce the blood-colored mask. He immediately put it on, causing his Cultivation base to explode with power, and a Blood Qi to rise up. His aura spread out in all directions, causing the Cultivators to feel complete astonishment. The pupils of the two mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators constricted. As of this moment, they had no desire whatsoever to participate in the conflict between Yi Chenzi and Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody owns the Celestial soil,” said Meng Hao, “so it belongs to whoever manages to snatch it! If you have the skill to escape with it, then it will belong to you!” With that, he shot forward with incredible speed. The distance between the two immediately lessened. Meng Hao waved his right hand, causing a blood-colored face to appear. Rumbling filled the air as it shot toward the fleeing Yi Chenzi, whose face immediately fell. He quickly performed an incantation with his left hand, causing a glistening fish scale to appear in his palm. He threw it out behind him, where it instantly began to expand until it was about ten meters tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom rattled out as the power of Meng Hao’s Blood Immortal face slammed into its blocking force. Yi Chenzi coughed up some blood, then suddenly vanished. When he reappeared, he was already three thousand meters away. He turned back, a sinister smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Draconic Vulture Transformation!” he cried. Immediately, the fish scale exploded out in size. Black Qi boiled up into the sky, transforming into an enormous vulture. The vulture’s eyes were bright red as it charged toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face was completely expressionless as he said, “A single word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the face once again appeared. Its lips began to move as amorphous ripples began to spread out. The seemingly horrifying vulture suddenly began to tremble, then suddenly collapsed into pieces. Meng Hao, moving as fast as lightning, shot through the collapsing pieces of the vulture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis caused Yi Chenzi’s face to fall. He immediately spun around and once again began to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, how come that bastard has so many divine abilities. He has three totems, Metal, Fire and Wood. And what magical item was that mask just now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was the same as ever as he employed a minor teleportation as he shot in pursuit of Yi Chenzi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[audio mp3\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yi_chenzi.mp3\"][/audio]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Julien Vent, DP and Carter B\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"footnotes\"\u003e\n \u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan id\u003d\"footnote-1\"\u003eYi Chenzi\u0027s name in Chinese is 一尘子 yī chén zǐ.
