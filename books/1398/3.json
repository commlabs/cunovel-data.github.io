A steep zigzag path with almost never-ending steps had been made along the face of the rock from a little flower garden attached to the house which lay immediately under the mountain.\u0026nbsp; Close along the front of the hotel ran a little brawling river, leaving barely room for a road between it and the door; over this there was a wooden bridge leading to the garden, and some two or three hundred yards from the bridge began the steps by which the ascent was made to the grotto.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the season was full and the weather perfectly warm the place was much frequented.\u0026nbsp; There was a green table in it, and four or five deal chairs; a green garden seat also was there, which however had been removed into the innermost back corner of the excavation, as its hinder legs were somewhat at fault.\u0026nbsp; A wall about two feet high ran along the face of it, guarding its occupants from the precipice.\u0026nbsp; In fact it was no grotto, but a little chasm in the rock, such as we often see up above our heads in rocky valleys, and which by means of these steep steps had been turned into a source of exercise and amusement for the visitors at the hotel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Standing at the wall one could look down into the garden, and down also upon the shining slate roof of Madame Bauche’s house; and to the left might be seen the sombre, silent, snow-capped top of stern old Canigou, king of mountains among those Eastern Pyrenees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so Madame Bauche undertook to send Marie up to the grotto, and Adolphe undertook to follow her thither.\u0026nbsp; It was now spring; and though the winds had fallen and the snow was no longer lying on the lower peaks, still the air was fresh and cold, and there was no danger that any of the few guests at the establishment would visit the place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Make her put on her cloak, Mère Bauche,” said the capitaine, who did not wish that his bride should have a cold in her head on their wedding-day.\u0026nbsp; La Mère Bauche pished and pshawed, as though she were not minded to pay any attention to recommendations on such subjects from the capitaine.\u0026nbsp; But nevertheless when Marie was seen slowly to creep across the little bridge about fifteen minutes after this time, she had a handkerchief on her head, and was closely wrapped in a dark brown cloak.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Poor Marie herself little heeded the cold fresh air, but she was glad to avail herself of any means by which she might hide her face.\u0026nbsp; When Madame Bauche sought her out in her own little room, and with a smiling face and kind kiss bade her go to the grotto, she knew, or fancied that she knew that it was all over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He will tell you all the truth,—how it all is,” said La Mère.\u0026nbsp; “We will do all we can, you know, to make you happy, Marie.\u0026nbsp; But you must remember what Monsieur le Curé told us the other day.\u0026nbsp; In this vale of tears we cannot have everything; as we shall have some day, when our poor wicked souls have been purged of all their wickedness.\u0026nbsp; Now go, dear, and take your cloak.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, maman.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And Adolphe will come to you.\u0026nbsp; And try and behave well, like a sensible girl.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, maman,”—and so she went, bearing on her brow another sacrificial kiss—and bearing in her heart such an unutterable load of woe!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Adolphe had gone out of the house before her; but standing in the stable yard, well within the gate so that she should not see him, he watched her slowly crossing the bridge and mounting the first flight of the steps.\u0026nbsp; He had often seen her tripping up those stairs, and had, almost as often, followed her with his quicker feet.\u0026nbsp; And she, when she would hear him, would run; and then he would catch her breathless at the top, and steal kisses from her when all power of refusing them had been robbed from her by her efforts at escape.\u0026nbsp; There was no such running now, no such following, no thought of such kisses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for him, he would fain have skulked off and shirked the interview had he dared.\u0026nbsp; But he did not dare; so he waited there, out of heart, for some ten minutes, speaking a word now and then to the bath-man, who was standing by, just to show that he was at his ease.\u0026nbsp; But the bath-man knew that he was not at his ease.\u0026nbsp; Such would-be lies as those rarely achieve deception;—are rarely believed.\u0026nbsp; And then, at the end of the ten minutes, with steps as slow as Marie’s had been, he also ascended to the grotto.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marie had watched him from the top, but so that she herself should not be seen.\u0026nbsp; He however had not once lifted up his head to look for her; but with eyes turned to the ground had plodded his way up to the cave.\u0026nbsp; When he entered she was standing in the middle, with her eyes downcast and her hands clasped before her.\u0026nbsp; She had retired some way from the wall, so that no eyes might possibly see her but those of her false lover.\u0026nbsp; There she stood when he entered, striving to stand motionless, but trembling like a leaf in every limb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was only when he reached the top step that he made up his mind how he would behave.\u0026nbsp; Perhaps after all, the capitaine was right; perhaps she would not mind it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marie,” said he, with a voice that attempted to be cheerful; “this is an odd place to meet in after such a long absence,” and he held out his hand to her.\u0026nbsp; But only his hand!\u0026nbsp; He offered her no salute.\u0026nbsp; He did not even kiss her cheek as a brother would have done!\u0026nbsp; Of the rules of the outside world it must be remembered that poor Marie knew but little.\u0026nbsp; He had been a brother to her before he had become her lover.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Marie took his hand saying, “Yes, it has been very long.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And now that I have come back,” he went on to say, “it seems that we are all in a confusion together.\u0026nbsp; I never knew such a piece of work.\u0026nbsp; However, it is all for the best, I suppose.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Perhaps so,” said Marie, still trembling violently, and still looking upon the ground.\u0026nbsp; And then there was silence between them for a minute or so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I tell you what it is, Marie,” said Adolphe at last, dropping her hand and making a great effort to get through the work before him.\u0026nbsp; “I am afraid we two have been very foolish.\u0026nbsp; Don’t you think we have now?\u0026nbsp; It seems quite clear that we can never get ourselves married.\u0026nbsp; Don’t you see it in that light?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marie’s head turned round and round with her, but she was not of the fainting order.\u0026nbsp; She took three steps backwards and leant against the wall of the cave.\u0026nbsp; She also was trying to think how she might best fight her battle.\u0026nbsp; Was there no chance for her?\u0026nbsp; Could no eloquence, no love prevail?\u0026nbsp; On her own beauty she counted but little; but might not prayers do something, and a reference to those old vows which had been so frequent, so eager, so solemnly pledged between them?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never get ourselves married!” she said, repeating his words.\u0026nbsp; “Never, Adolphe?\u0026nbsp; Can we never be married?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Upon my word, my dear girl, I fear not.\u0026nbsp; You see my mother is so dead against it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But we could wait; could we not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ah, but that’s just it, Marie.\u0026nbsp; We cannot wait.\u0026nbsp; We must decide now,—to-day.\u0026nbsp; You see I can do nothing without money from her—and as for you, you see she won’t even let you stay in the house unless you marry old Campan at once.\u0026nbsp; He’s a very good sort of fellow though, old as he is.\u0026nbsp; And if you do marry him, why you see you’ll stay here, and have it all your own way in everything.\u0026nbsp; As for me, I shall come and see you all from time to time, and shall be able to push my way as I ought to do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then, Adolphe, you wish me to marry the capitaine?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Upon my honour I think it is the best thing you can do; I do indeed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, Adolphe!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What can I do for you, you know?\u0026nbsp; Suppose I was to go down to my mother and tell her that I had decided to keep you myself; what would come of it?\u0026nbsp; Look at it in that light, Marie.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “She could not turn you out—you her own son!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But she would turn you out; and deuced quick, too, I can assure you of that; I can, upon my honour.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I should not care that,” and she made a motion with her hand to show how indifferent she would be to such treatment as regarded herself.\u0026nbsp; “Not that—; if I still had the promise of your love.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But what would you do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I would work.\u0026nbsp; There are other houses beside that one,” and she pointed to the slate roof of the Bauche establishment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And for me—I should not have a penny in the world,” said the young man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She came up to him and took his right hand between both of hers and pressed it warmly, oh, so warmly.\u0026nbsp; “You would have my love,” said she; “my deepest, warmest best heart’s love should want nothing more, nothing on earth, if I could still have yours.”\u0026nbsp; And she leaned against his shoulder and looked with all her eyes into his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But, Marie, that’s nonsense, you know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, Adolphe, it is not nonsense.\u0026nbsp; Do not let them teach you so.\u0026nbsp; What does love mean, if it does not mean that?\u0026nbsp; Oh, Adolphe, you do love me, you do love me, you do love me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes;—I love you,” he said slowly;—as though he would not have said it, if he could have helped it.\u0026nbsp; And then his arm crept slowly round her waist, as though in that also he could not help himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And do not I love you?” said the passionate girl.\u0026nbsp; “Oh, I do, so dearly; with all my heart, with all my soul.\u0026nbsp; Adolphe, I so love you, that I cannot give you up.\u0026nbsp; Have I not sworn to be yours; sworn, sworn a thousand times?\u0026nbsp; How can I marry that man!\u0026nbsp; Oh Adolphe how can you wish that I should marry him?”\u0026nbsp; And she clung to him, and looked at him, and besought him with her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shouldn’t wish it;—only—” and then he paused.\u0026nbsp; It was hard to tell her that he was willing to sacrifice her to the old man because he wanted money from his mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Only what!\u0026nbsp; But Adolphe, do not wish it at all!\u0026nbsp; Have you not sworn that I should be your wife?\u0026nbsp; Look here, look at this;” and she brought out from her bosom a little charm that he had given her in return for that cross.\u0026nbsp; “Did you not kiss that when you swore before the figure of the Virgin that I should be your wife?\u0026nbsp; And do you not remember that I feared to swear too, because your mother was so angry; and then you made me?\u0026nbsp; After that, Adolphe!\u0026nbsp; Oh, Adolphe!\u0026nbsp; Tell me that I may have some hope.\u0026nbsp; I will wait; oh, I will wait so patiently.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned himself away from her and walked backwards and forwards uneasily through the grotto.\u0026nbsp; He did love her;—love her as such men do love sweet, pretty girls.\u0026nbsp; The warmth of her hand, the affection of her touch, the pure bright passion of her tear-laden eye had re-awakened what power of love there was within him.\u0026nbsp; But what was he to do?\u0026nbsp; Even if he were willing to give up the immediate golden hopes which his mother held out to him, how was he to begin, and then how carry out this work of self-devotion?\u0026nbsp; Marie would be turned away, and he would be left a victim in the hands of his mother, and of that stiff, wooden-legged militaire;—a penniless victim, left to mope about the place without a grain of influence or a morsel of pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But what can we do?” he exclaimed again, as he once more met Marie’s searching eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We can be true and honest, and we can wait,” she said, coming close up to him and taking hold of his arm.\u0026nbsp; “I do not fear it; and she is not my mother, Adolphe.\u0026nbsp; You need not fear your own mother.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fear! no, of course I don’t fear.\u0026nbsp; But I don’t see how the very devil we can manage it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Will you let me tell her that I will not marry the capitaine; that I will not give up your promises; and then I am ready to leave the house?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It would do no good.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It would do every good, Adolphe, if I had your promised word once more; if I could hear from your own voice one more tone of love.\u0026nbsp; Do you not remember this place?\u0026nbsp; It was here that you forced me to say that I loved you.\u0026nbsp; It is here also that you will tell me that I have been deceived.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is not I that would deceive you,” he said.\u0026nbsp; “I wonder that you should be so hard upon me.\u0026nbsp; God knows that I have trouble enough.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, if I am a trouble to you, be it so.\u0026nbsp; Be it as you wish,” and she leaned back against the wall of the rock, and crossing her arms upon her breast looked away from him and fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of Canigou.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He again betook himself to walk backwards and forwards through the cave.\u0026nbsp; He had quite enough of love for her to make him wish to marry her; quite enough now, at this moment, to make the idea of her marriage with the capitaine very distasteful to him; enough probably to make him become a decently good husband to her, should fate enable him to marry her; but not enough to enable him to support all the punishment which would be the sure effects of his mother’s displeasure.\u0026nbsp; Besides, he had promised his mother that he would give up Marie;—had entirely given in his adhesion to that plan of the marriage with the capitaine.\u0026nbsp; He had owned that the path of life as marked out for him by his mother was the one which it behoved him, as a man, to follow.\u0026nbsp; It was this view of his duties as a man which had I been specially urged on him with all the capitaine’s eloquence.\u0026nbsp; And old Campan had entirely succeeded.\u0026nbsp; It is so easy to get the assent of such young men, so weak in mind and so weak in pocket, when the arguments are backed by a promise of two thousand francs a year.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” at last he said.\u0026nbsp; “I’ll get my mother by herself, and will ask her to let the matter remain as it is for the present.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not if it be a trouble, M. Adolphe;” and the proud girl still held her hands upon her bosom, and still looked towards the mountain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You know what I mean, Marie.\u0026nbsp; You can understand how she and the capitaine are worrying me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But tell me, Adolphe, do you love me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You know I love you, only.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you will not give me up?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will ask my mother.\u0026nbsp; I will try and make her yield.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marie could not feel that she received much confidence from her lover’s promise; but still, even that, weak and unsteady as it was, even that was better than absolute fixed rejection.\u0026nbsp; So she thanked him, promised him with tears in her eyes that she would always, always be faithful to him, and then bade him go down to the house.\u0026nbsp; She would follow, she said, as soon as his passing had ceased to be observed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she looked at him as though she expected some sign of renewed love.\u0026nbsp; But no such sign was vouchsafed to her.\u0026nbsp; Now that she thirsted for the touch of his lip upon her check, it was denied to her.\u0026nbsp; He did as she bade him; he went down, slowly loitering, by himself; and in about half an hour she followed him, and unobserved crept to her chamber.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again we will pass over what took place between the mother and the son; but late in that evening, after the guests had gone to bed, Marie received a message, desiring her to wait on Madame Bauche in a small salon which looked out from one end of the house.\u0026nbsp; It was intended as a private sitting-room should any special stranger arrive who required such accommodation, and therefore was but seldom used.\u0026nbsp; Here she found La Mère Bauche sitting in an arm-chair behind a small table on which stood two candles; and on a sofa against the wall sat Adolphe.\u0026nbsp; The capitaine was not in the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shut the door, Marie, and come in and sit down,” said Madame Bauche.\u0026nbsp; It was easy to understand from the tone of her voice that she was angry and stern, in an unbending mood, and resolved to carry out to the very letter all the threats conveyed by those terrible spectacles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marie did as she was bid.\u0026nbsp; She closed the door and sat down on the chair that was nearest to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marie,” said La Mère Bauche—and the voice sounded fierce in the poor girl’s ears, and an angry fire glimmered through the green glasses—“what is all this about that I hear?\u0026nbsp; Do you dare to say that you hold my son bound to marry you?”\u0026nbsp; And then the august mother paused for an answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Marie had no answer to give.\u0026nbsp; See looked suppliantly towards her lover, as though beseeching him to carry on the fight for her.\u0026nbsp; But if she could not do battle for herself, certainly he could not do it for her.\u0026nbsp; What little amount of fighting he had had in him, had been thoroughly vanquished before her arrival.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will have an answer, and that immediately,” said Madame Bauche.\u0026nbsp; “I am not going to be betrayed into ignominy and disgrace by the object of my own charity.\u0026nbsp; Who picked you out of the gutter, miss, and brought you up and fed you, when you would otherwise have gone to the foundling?\u0026nbsp; And this is your gratitude for it all?\u0026nbsp; You are not satisfied with being fed and clothed and cherished by me, but you must rob me of my son!\u0026nbsp; Know this then, Adolphe shall never marry a child of charity such as you are.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marie sat still, stunned by the harshness of these words.\u0026nbsp; La Mère Bauche had often scolded her; indeed, she was given to much scolding; but she had scolded her as a mother may scold a child.\u0026nbsp; And when this story of Marie’s love first reached her ears, she had been very angry; but her anger had never brought her to such a pass as this.\u0026nbsp; Indeed, Marie had not hitherto been taught to look at the matter in this light.\u0026nbsp; No one had heretofore twitted her with eating the bread of charity.\u0026nbsp; It had not occurred to her that on this account she was unfit to be Adolphe’s wife.\u0026nbsp; There, in that valley, they were all so nearly equal, that no idea of her own inferiority had ever pressed itself upon her mind.\u0026nbsp; But now—!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the voice ceased she again looked at him; but it was no longer a beseeching look.\u0026nbsp; Did he also altogether scorn her?\u0026nbsp; That was now the inquiry which her eyes were called upon to make.\u0026nbsp; No; she could not say that he did.\u0026nbsp; It seemed to her that his energies were chiefly occupied in pulling to pieces the tassel on the sofa cushion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And now, miss, let me know at once whether this nonsense is to be over or not,” continued La Mère Bauche; “and I will tell you at once, I am not going to maintain you here, in my house, to plot against our welfare and happiness.\u0026nbsp; As Marie Clavert you shall not stay here.\u0026nbsp; Capitaine Campan is willing to marry you; and as his wife I will keep my word to you, though you little deserve it.\u0026nbsp; If you refuse to marry him, you must go.\u0026nbsp; As to my son, he is there; and he will tell you now, in my presence, that he altogether declines the honour you propose for him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then she ceased, waiting for an answer, drumming the table with a wafer stamp which happened to be ready to her hand; but Marie said nothing.\u0026nbsp; Adolphe had been appealed to; but Adolphe had not yet spoken.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, miss?” said La Mère Bauche\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Marie rose from her seat, and walking round she touched Adolphe lightly on the shoulder.\u0026nbsp; “Adolphe,” she said, “it is for you to speak now.\u0026nbsp; I will do as you bid me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He gave a long sigh, looked first at Marie and then at his mother, shook himself slightly, and then spoke: “Upon my word, Marie, I think mother is right.\u0026nbsp; It would never do for us to marry; it would not indeed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then it is decided,” said Marie, returning to her chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you will marry the capitaine?” said La Mère Bauche.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marie merely bowed her head in token of acquiescence.\u0026nbsp; “Then we are friends again.\u0026nbsp; Come here, Marie, and kiss me.\u0026nbsp; You must know that it is my duty to take care of my own son.\u0026nbsp; But I don’t want to be angry with you if I can help it; I don’t indeed.\u0026nbsp; When once you are Madame Campan, you shall be my own child; and you shall have any room in the house you like to choose—there!”\u0026nbsp; And she once more imprinted a kiss on Marie’s cold forehead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How they all got out of the room, and off to their own chambers, I can hardly tell.\u0026nbsp; But in five minutes from the time of this last kiss they were divided.\u0026nbsp; La Mère Bauche had patted Marie, and smiled on her, and called her her dear good little Madame Campan, her young little Mistress of the H?tel Bauche; and had then got herself into her own room, satisfied with her own victory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nor must my readers be too severe on Madame Bauche.\u0026nbsp; She had already done much for Marie Clavert; and when she found herself once more by her own bedside, she prayed to be forgiven for the cruelty which she felt that she had shown to the orphan.\u0026nbsp; But in making this prayer, with her favourite crucifix in her hand and the little image of the Virgin before her, she pleaded her duty to her son.\u0026nbsp; Was it not right, she asked the Virgin, that she should save her son from a bad marriage?\u0026nbsp; And then she promised ever so much of recompense, both to the Virgin and to Marie; a new trousseau for each, with candles to the Virgin, with a gold watch and chain for Marie, as soon as she should be Marie Campan.\u0026nbsp; She had been cruel; she acknowledged it.\u0026nbsp; But at such a crisis was it not defensible?\u0026nbsp; And then the recompense should be so full!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there was one other meeting that night, very short indeed, but not the less significant.\u0026nbsp; Not long after they had all separated, just so long as to allow of the house being quiet, Adolphe, still sitting in his room, meditating on what the day had done for him, heard a low tap at his door.\u0026nbsp; “Come in,” he said, as men always do say; and Marie opening the door, stood just within the verge of his chamber.\u0026nbsp; She had on her countenance neither the soft look of entreating love which she had worn up there in the grotto, nor did she appear crushed and subdued as she had done before his mother.\u0026nbsp; She carried her head somewhat more erect than usual, and looked boldly out at him from under her soft eyelashes.\u0026nbsp; There might still be love there, but it was love proudly resolving to quell itself.\u0026nbsp; Adolphe, as he looked at her, felt that he was afraid of her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is all over then between us, M. Adolphe?” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, yes.\u0026nbsp; Don’t you think it had better be so, eh, Marie?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And this is the meaning of oaths and vows, sworn to each other so sacredly?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But, Marie, you heard what my mother said.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, sir!\u0026nbsp; I have not come to ask you again to love me.\u0026nbsp; Oh no!\u0026nbsp; I am not thinking of that.\u0026nbsp; But this, this would be a lie if I kept it now; it would choke me if I wore it as that man’s wife.\u0026nbsp; Take it back;” and she tendered to him the little charm which she had always worn round her neck since he had given it to her.\u0026nbsp; He took it abstractedly, without thinking what he did, and placed it on his dressing-table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you,” she continued, “can you still keep that cross?\u0026nbsp; Oh, no! you must give me back that.\u0026nbsp; It would remind you too often of vows that were untrue.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marie,” he said, “do not be so harsh to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Harsh!” said she, “no; there has been enough of harshness.\u0026nbsp; I would not be harsh to you, Adolphe.\u0026nbsp; But give me the cross; it would prove a curse to you if you kept it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He then opened a little box which stood upon the table, and taking out the cross gave it to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And now good-bye,” she said.\u0026nbsp; “We shall have but little more to say to each other.\u0026nbsp; I know this now, that I was wrong ever to have loved you.\u0026nbsp; I should have been to you as one of the other poor girls in the house.\u0026nbsp; But, oh! how was I to help it?”\u0026nbsp; To this he made no answer, and she, closing the door softly, went back to her chamber.\u0026nbsp; And thus ended the first day of Adolphe Bauche’s return to his own house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the next morning the capitaine and Marie were formally betrothed.\u0026nbsp; This was done with some little ceremony, in the presence of all the guests who were staying at the establishment, and with all manner of gracious acknowledgments of Marie’s virtues.\u0026nbsp; It seemed as though La Mère Bauche could not be courteous enough to her.\u0026nbsp; There was no more talk of her being a child of charity; no more allusion now to the gutter.\u0026nbsp; La Mère Bauche with her own hand brought her cake with a glass of wine after her betrothal was over, and patted her on the cheek, and called her her dear little Marie Campan.\u0026nbsp; And then the capitaine was made up of infinite politeness, and the guests all wished her joy, and the servants of the house began to perceive that she was a person entitled to respect.\u0026nbsp; How different was all this from that harsh attack that was made on her the preceding evening!\u0026nbsp; Only Adolphe,—he alone kept aloof.\u0026nbsp; Though he was present there he said nothing.\u0026nbsp; He, and he only, offered no congratulations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the midst of all these gala doings Marie herself said little or nothing.\u0026nbsp; La Mère Bauche perceived this, but she forgave it.\u0026nbsp; Angrily as she had expressed herself at the idea of Marie’s daring to love her son, she had still acknowledged within her own heart that such love had been natural.\u0026nbsp; She could feel no pity for Marie as long as Adolphe was in danger; but now she knew how to pity her.\u0026nbsp; So Marie was still petted and still encouraged, though she went through the day’s work sullenly and in silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As to the capitaine it was all one to him.\u0026nbsp; He was a man of the world.\u0026nbsp; He did not expect that he should really be preferred, con amore, to a young fellow like Adolphe.\u0026nbsp; But he did expect that Marie, like other girls, would do as she was bid; and that in a few days she would regain her temper and be reconciled to her life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then the marriage was fixed for a very early day; for as La Mère said, “What was the use of waiting?\u0026nbsp; All their minds were made up now, and therefore the sooner the two were married the better.\u0026nbsp; Did not the capitaine think so?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The capitaine said that he did think so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then Marie was asked.\u0026nbsp; It was all one to her, she said.\u0026nbsp; Whatever Maman Bauche liked, that she would do; only she would not name a day herself.\u0026nbsp; Indeed she would neither do nor say anything herself which tended in any way to a furtherance of these matrimonials.\u0026nbsp; But then she acquiesced, quietly enough if not readily, in what other people did and said; and so the marriage was fixed for the day week after Adolphe’s return.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The whole of that week passed much in the same way.\u0026nbsp; The servants about the place spoke among themselves of Marie’s perverseness, obstinacy, and ingratitude, because she would not look pleased, or answer Madame Bauche’s courtesies with gratitude; but La Mère herself showed no signs of anger.\u0026nbsp; Marie had yielded to her, and she required no more.\u0026nbsp; And she remembered also the harsh words she had used to gain her purpose; and she reflected on all that Marie had lost.\u0026nbsp; On these accounts she was forbearing and exacted nothing—nothing but that one sacrifice which was to be made in accordance to her wishes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And it was made.\u0026nbsp; They were married in the great salon, the dining-room, immediately after breakfast.\u0026nbsp; Madame Bauche was dressed in a new puce silk dress, and looked very magnificent on the occasion.\u0026nbsp; She simpered and smiled, and looked gay even in spite of her spectacles; and as the ceremony was being performed, she held fast clutched in her hand the gold watch and chain which were intended for Marie as soon as ever the marriage should be completed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The capitaine was dressed exactly as usual, only that all his clothes were new.\u0026nbsp; Madame Bauche had endeavoured to persuade him to wear a blue coat; but he answered that such a change would not, he was sure, be to Marie’s taste.\u0026nbsp; To tell the truth, Marie would hardly have known the difference had he presented himself in scarlet vestments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Adolphe, however, was dressed very finely, but he did not make himself prominent on the occasion.\u0026nbsp; Marie watched him closely, though none saw that she did so; and of his garments she could have given an account with much accuracy—of his garments, ay! and of every look.\u0026nbsp; “Is he a man,” she said at last to herself, “that he can stand by and see all this?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She too was dressed in silk.\u0026nbsp; They had put on her what they pleased, and she bore the burden of her wedding finery without complaint and without pride.\u0026nbsp; There was no blush on her face as she walked up to the table at which the priest stood, nor hesitation in her low voice as she made the necessary answers.\u0026nbsp; She put her hand into that of the capitaine when required to do so; and when the ring was put on her finger she shuddered, but ever so slightly.\u0026nbsp; No one observed it but La Mère Bauche.\u0026nbsp; “In one week she will be used to it, and then we shall all be happy,” said La Mère to herself.\u0026nbsp; “And I,—I will be so kind to her!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so the marriage was completed, and the watch was at once given to Marie.\u0026nbsp; “Thank you, maman,” said she, as the trinket was fastened to her girdle.\u0026nbsp; Had it been a pincushion that had cost three sous, it would have affected her as much.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then there was cake and wine and sweetmeats; and after a few minutes Marie disappeared.\u0026nbsp; For an hour or so the capitaine was taken up with the congratulating of his friends, and with the efforts necessary to the wearing of his new honours with an air of ease; but after that time he began to be uneasy because his wife did not come to him.\u0026nbsp; At two or three in the afternoon he went to La Mère Bauche to complain.\u0026nbsp; “This lackadaisical nonsense is no good,” he said.\u0026nbsp; “At any rate it is too late now.\u0026nbsp; Marie had better come down among us and show herself satisfied with her husband.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Madame Bauche took Marie’s part.\u0026nbsp; “You must not be too hard on Marie,” she said.\u0026nbsp; “She has gone through a good deal this week past, and is very young; whereas, capitaine, you are not very young.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The capitaine merely shrugged his shoulders.\u0026nbsp; In the mean time Mère Bauche went up to visit her protégée in her own room, and came down with a report that she was suffering from a headache.\u0026nbsp; She could not appear at dinner, Madame Bauche said; but would make one at the little party which was to be given in the evening.\u0026nbsp; With this the capitaine was forced to be content.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dinner therefore went on quietly without her, much as it did on other ordinary days.\u0026nbsp; And then there was a little time for vacancy, during which the gentlemen drank their coffee and smoked their cigars at the café, talking over the event that had taken place that morning, and the ladies brushed their hair and added some ribbon or some brooch to their usual apparel.\u0026nbsp; Twice during this time did Madame Bauche go up to Marie’s room with offers to assist her.\u0026nbsp; “Not yet, maman; not quite yet,” said Marie piteously through her tears, and then twice did the green spectacles leave the room, covering eyes which also were not dry.\u0026nbsp; Ah! what had she done?\u0026nbsp; What had she dared to take upon herself to do?\u0026nbsp; She could not undo it now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then it became quite dark in the passages and out of doors, and the guests assembled in the salon.\u0026nbsp; La Mère came in and out three or four times, uneasy in her gait and unpleasant in her aspect, and everybody began to see that things were wrong.\u0026nbsp; “She is ill, I am afraid,” said one.\u0026nbsp; “The excitement has been too much,” said a second; “and he is so old,” whispered a third.\u0026nbsp; And the capitaine stalked about erect on his wooden leg, taking snuff, and striving to look indifferent; but he also was uneasy in his mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently La Mère came in again, with a quicker step than before, and whispered something, first to Adolphe and then to the capitaine, whereupon they both followed her out of the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not in her chamber,” said Adolphe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then she must be in yours,” said the capitaine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “She is in neither,” said La Mère Bauche, with her sternest voice; “nor is she in the house!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now there was no longer an affectation of indifference on the part of any of them.\u0026nbsp; They were anything but indifferent.\u0026nbsp; The capitaine was eager in his demands that the matter should still be kept secret from the guests.\u0026nbsp; She had always been romantic, he said, and had now gone out to walk by the river side.\u0026nbsp; They three and the old bath-man would go out and look for her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But it is pitch dark,” said La Mère Bauche.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We will take lanterns,” said the capitaine.\u0026nbsp; And so they sallied forth with creeping steps over the gravel, so that they might not be heard by those within, and proceeded to search for the young wife.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marie!\u0026nbsp; Marie!” said La Mère Bauche, in piteous accents; “do come to me; pray do!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hush!” said the capitaine.\u0026nbsp; “They’ll hear you if you call.”\u0026nbsp; He could not endure that the world should learn that a marriage with him had been so distasteful to Marie Clavert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marie, dear Marie!” called Madame Bauche, louder than before, quite regardless of the capitaine’s feelings; but no Marie answered.\u0026nbsp; In her innermost heart now did La Mère Bauche wish that this cruel marriage had been left undone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Adolphe was foremost with his lamp, but he hardly dared to look in the spot where he felt that it was most likely that she should have taken refuge.\u0026nbsp; How could he meet her again, alone, in that grotto?\u0026nbsp; Yet he alone of the four was young.\u0026nbsp; It was clearly for him to ascend.\u0026nbsp; “Marie,” he shouted, “are you there?” as he slowly began the long ascent of the steps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he had hardly begun to mount when a whirring sound struck his ear, and he felt that the air near him was moved; and then there was a crash upon the lower platform of rock, and a moan, repeated twice, but so faintly, and a rustle of silk, and a slight struggle somewhere as he knew within twenty paces of him; and then all was again quiet and still in the night air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What was that?” asked the capitaine in a hoarse voice.\u0026nbsp; He made his way half across the little garden, and he also was within forty or fifty yards of the flat rock.\u0026nbsp; But Adolphe was unable to answer him.\u0026nbsp; He had fainted and the lamp had fallen from his hands and rolled to the bottom of the steps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the capitaine, though even his heart was all but quenched within him, had still strength enough to make his way up to the rock; and there, holding the lantern above his eyes, he saw all that was left for him to see of his bride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for La Mère Bauche, she never again sat at the head of that table,—never again dictated to guests,—never again laid down laws for the management of any one.\u0026nbsp; A poor bedridden old woman, she lay there in her house at Vernet for some seven tedious years, and then was gathered to her fathers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for the capitaine—but what matters?\u0026nbsp; He was made of sterner stuff.\u0026nbsp; What matters either the fate of such a one as Adolphe Bauche?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2733/75271.html","bookId":1398,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:51:03 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:51:03 PM"}
