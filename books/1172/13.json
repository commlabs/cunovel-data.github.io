He was dressed in the uniform of an officer of the royal guards—the body commanded by Fonseca. At his back were two others, silent but alert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are here in the service of General da Fonseca?” I asked, with assumed composure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In the Emperor’s service, senhor,” answered the officer, quietly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But the general—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The general is unaware of our mission. I have my orders from his Majesty in person.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled somewhat unpleasantly as he made this statement, and for the first time I realized that my arrest might prove a great misfortune.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Pardon me if I appear discourteous,” he continued, and made a sign to his men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 153One took the candle from my hand and the other snapped a pair of hand-cuffs over my wrists.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I had no spirit to resist. The surprise had been so complete that it well-nigh benumbed my faculties. I heard the officer’s voice imploring me in polite tones to follow, and then my captors extinguished the candle and marched me away through a succession of black passages until we had reached an upper room at the back of the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here a door quickly opened and I was thrust into a blaze of light so brilliant that it nearly blinded me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Blinking my eyes to accustom them to the glare, I presently began to note my surroundings, and found myself standing before a table at which was seated the Emperor of Brazil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Involuntarily I bowed before his Majesty. He was a large man, of commanding appearance, with dark eyes that seemed to read one through and through. Behind him stood a group of four men in civilian attire, while the other end of the room was 154occupied by a squad of a dozen soldiers of the Uruguayan guard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A prisoner, your Majesty,” said the officer, saluting. “One evidently familiar with the house, for he obtained entrance to a room adjoining Dom Miguel’s library.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Emperor turned from the papers that littered the table and eyed me gravely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your name!” said he, in a stern voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hesitated; but remembering that officially I was occupying a dungeon in Rio I decided to continue the deception of my present disguise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Andrea Subig, your Majesty.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some one laughed softly beside me. I turned and saw Valcour at my elbow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is the American secretary, your Majesty, one Robert Harcliffe by name.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The spy spoke in his womanish, dainty manner, and with such evident satisfaction that I could have strangled him with much pleasure had I been free.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why are you here?” inquired the Emperor, after eyeing me curiously for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have some personal belongings in this 155house which I wished to secure before returning to the United States. Your men arrested me in the room I have been occupying.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why are you anxious to return to the United States?” questioned the Emperor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Because my mission to Brazil is ended.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is true,” returned Dom Pedro, positively. “The conspiracy is at an end.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Of that I am not informed,” I replied evasively. “But I have been employed by Dom Miguel de Pintra, not by the conspiracy, as your Majesty terms it. And Dom Miguel has no further need of me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dom Miguel is dead,” retorted the Emperor, with an accent of triumph in his voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Murdered by his daughter, your spy,” I added, seeing that he was aware of the truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He merely shrugged his broad shoulders and turned to whisper to a gray-bearded man behind him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This conspiracy must be summarily dealt with,” resumed the Emperor, turning to me again, “and as there is ample evidence 156that you are guilty of treason, Senhor Harcliffe, I shall order you put to death unless you at once agree to give us such information as may be in your possession.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am an American citizen and entitled to a fair trial,” I answered, boldly enough. “You dare not assassinate me. For if I am injured in any way the United States will call you to full account.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is a matter of treason, sir!” returned the Emperor, harshly. “Your citizenship will not protect you in this case. I have myself visited your country and been received there with great courtesy. And no one knows better than I that your countrymen would repudiate one who came to Brazil for the treasonable purpose of dethroning its legitimate Emperor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was true enough, and I remained silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Will you give us the required information?” he demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I was curious to know how much the royalists had learned, and in what position the republicans had been placed by this imperial visit to their headquarters. Dom 157Pedro had said that the conspiracy was at an end; but I did not believe that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am sure you err in believing me to be in the secret counsels of the republicans,” I said, after a moment’s thought. “I was merely employed in the capacity of private secretary to Dom Miguel.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But you know of the underground vault? You have visited it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Often,” I replied, seeing no harm in the acknowledgment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Can you open it for us?” he demanded. I laughed, for the question exposed to me his real weakness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your Majesty must be well aware that there is but one key,” I replied, “and without that secret key I am as powerless as you are to open the vault.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where is the key?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I do not know. Senhora de Mar stole it from Dom Miguel.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And it was taken from her by one of your conspirators.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you traced it no farther?” I inquired, carelessly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shifted uneasily in his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 158“My men are now investigating the matter,” said he. “Doubtless the ring will soon be in our possession.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And how about the murdered man in the shrubbery?” I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The royalists exchanged glances, and one or two uttered exclamations of surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is there a murdered man in the shrubbery, Captain de Souza?” questioned the Emperor, sternly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not that I know of, your Majesty,” returned the officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I found him as I approached the house,” said I. “He has been shot within the hour, and his left hand severed at the wrist.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was evident that my news startled them. When I had described the location of the body some of the soldiers were sent to fetch it, and during their absence the Emperor resumed his questioning. I told him frankly that none of the records of the republicans was in my possession, and that whatever knowledge I had gained of the conspiracy or the conspirators could not be drawn from me by his threats of death. For 159now I began to understand that this visit to Dom Miguel’s house was a secret one, and that the royalists were as much in the dark as ever regarding the conspiracy itself or the whereabouts of its leaders. One thing only they knew—that the records were lying with Dom Miguel’s dead body in the secret vault, and that the ring which opened it was missing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before long the soldiers bore the body of the latest victim of the fatal ring into the presence of the Emperor, and Valcour bent over it eagerly for a moment, and then shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The man is a stranger,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Others present endeavored to identify the murdered man, but were equally unsuccessful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I could see by their uneasy looks that they were all suspicious of one another; for Captain de Souza protested that no shot could have been fired without some of his men hearing it, and the fact that the ring they sought had been so recently within their very reach led them to believe it might not now be very far away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 160For all the Emperor’s assumed calmness, I knew he was greatly disturbed by this last murder, as well as by the impotency of his spies to discover the whereabouts of the ring. When Valcour suggested, in his soft voice, that I had myself killed the fellow in the shrubbery, and had either secreted the ring or had it now in my possession, they pounced upon me eagerly, and I was subjected to a thorough search and afterward to severe questioning and many fierce threats.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a few moments the Emperor listened to the counsels of the group of advisors that stood at his back, and then ordered me safely confined until he had further use for me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The officer therefore marched me away to the front of the house, where, still securely hand-cuffed, I was thrust into a small chamber and left alone. The key was turned in the lock and I heard the soft foot-falls of a guard pacing up and down outside the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The long walk from the station and the excitement of the last hour had greatly 161wearied me; so I groped around in the dark until I found the bed with which the room was provided, and soon had forgotten all about the dreary conspiracy in a refreshing sleep.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1680/49520.html","bookId":1172,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:12:19 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:12:19 PM"}
