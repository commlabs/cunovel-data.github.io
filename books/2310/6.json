{"id":95642,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eU pon returning from her run, Lucia informed Jazz of two things. One, she\u0027d be camping out on Jazz\u0027s couch until her leasing agent found her a local apartment. Two, they had an appointment to shop for office space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re shopping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shopping is a necessary part of life, Jazz, you should reconcile yourself to it. Unless you want me to make all the decisions.\" Lucia didn\u0027t sound averse to it. Jazz eyed her distrustfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia drove. All the way, Jazz kept an eye on the street, but traffic patterns looked random and safe, and she saw nobody following - either from in front or behind - for more than a couple of blocks. It was possible the faceless bad guys had enough manpower to do fast-rotating teams, but if so, they were screwed anyway, and all the eagle-eye vigilance in the world wouldn\u0027t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo white vans, no black cars with tinted windows, no electric blue sedans with out-of-date plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when they pulled up in the parking lot of a five-story office building, she spotted someone she knew waiting, leaning against the granite-faced entrance with his long arms folded. Borden was back in casual mode, long leather jacket and blue jeans and an oatmeal-colored long-sleeved Henley underneath. Gelled hair again. He looked up as Jazz\u0027s car rattled to a stop, and straightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz took her time getting out, partly so as not to run over and bash his head against the wall, partly because she didn\u0027t want to show any awkwardness or hesitation from the pain. Smooth and controlled. She was going to out-Lucia Lucia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Borden said, and took a couple of steps toward her. She shut the car door, put her hands in her jacket pockets and looked at him with what was probably not a polite smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess, Counselor,\" she said, \"you\u0027re in the real estate business, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less. How are you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feeling?\" She forced herself not to limp as she walked toward, then past him. \"Great. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shiny tinted glass of the building\u0027s double doors, she saw Borden toss Lucia a look. Lucia shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have stayed in the hospital,\" he said, coming up next to her with a thick set of keys in his hand. He unlocked the door and pulled the right one open with a sigh of cool air. \"And for the record? I\u0027m not the landlord. I just helped Lucia find the place. Third floor. Take the elevator. You don\u0027t have to prove how tough you are by tackling the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him but walked inside the building. It was dark, except for some indirect spots illuminating empty alcoves and an equally empty reception desk. Still had that new-building smell, equal parts paint, drywall and fresh carpeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready to move in?\" Lucia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden nodded. \"If you sign the lease, you could be operational in a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia nodded and tucked her hair back behind her ear, sneaking a look at Jazz as she did so. Jazz watched the numbers flash on the floor counter overhead. When the right one arrived, she pushed through the still-opening doors...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDej�� vu, she thought, and fought the disorientation. She knew this place. Knew it. She knew what she\u0027d see before she looked left, or right. She knew that there would be a big-ass boardroom behind the reception-desk half wall directly in front of her, and that the table in there would be a long black lacquer thing, and she could see someone sitting there, looking up at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen. Ben McCarthy. I remember Ben McCarthy being here, in these offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself it was just a dream, but she couldn\u0027t make herself move. Her heart was hammering, her skin suddenly coated in sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden went to the reception desk and did something behind the counter. Lights flipped on and marched left and right in fluorescent banks. The place took on light and color. It was champagne-and-blond woods and dull silver, very chic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fully furnished,\" he said. \"The management fitted it out for an Internet firm that went belly-up before move-in. They\u0027ve been trying to lease it out for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other tenants in the building?\" Lucia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got a law firm moving in on five, and an investment firm coming in on the ground floor,\" Borden said. \"It\u0027s pretty safe. Very corporate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz walked over to the reception desk and looked at the half wall behind the empty chair. It was begging for a name. She blinked and imagined the silvery lettering on it: Callender \u0026amp; Garza. She wasn\u0027t sure if that made her feel better or even more disoriented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went around the wall. Behind it sat a black lacquer table that seated at least a dozen, with black leather chairs pulled around it. A Zen-appropriate arrangement of dried flowers in the center of the table. Beyond it, tinted glass had a view of the K.C. skyline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sense of dej�� vu was fading. Maybe it had just been one of those things, a weird-ass chemical imbalance of a brain that had suffered too many shocks recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Lucia say something about taking a look at the offices. She turned and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two large offices to the right, sharing an administrative station. Jazz entered the one on the left, moving by instinct, and noticed Lucia moved to the right. She stood in the doorway and looked at the expanse of carpet, the empty bookshelves, the desk and chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden had moved behind her. She could feel him there, even though he was staying a prudent few steps away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did a good job,\" he said, \"with the assignment. The client was pleased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t do anything.\" Jazz turned to face him. The indirect lighting did things to his face, made him look like a stranger. But then, he was a stranger, wasn\u0027t he? And she didn\u0027t really know a thing about him, except that he wasn\u0027t telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did exactly what you were supposed to do,\" he said, and suddenly put out a hand to grab her by the forearm. \"Jazz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d faltered, lost her balance, and only realized it after the fact. She leaned against a wall and sucked down deep breaths, clearing her head. \"Paint fumes,\" she mumbled. She felt light-headed and more than a little sick. \"You lied to me, Borden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could have moved his hand. He didn\u0027t. She felt his strong hold slacken a little, but he kept touching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t,\" he said, and moved closer. Too close. She felt smothered. \"I wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told us you don\u0027t do criminal cases.\" Like Manny, she thought. Manny won\u0027t do them, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden\u0027s sharp face went blank for a few seconds, then settled into an expression of resignation. \"Yeah. I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the pictures. You and Max Simms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name rocked him back, and she saw a startled flash in those big brown eyes, quickly concealed. \"That\u0027s what I get for generalizing to a cop,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t try that case, I was second chair. Laskins was principal. It was my first, last and only criminal trial with the firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of Simms?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled sadly. \"My firm doesn\u0027t like losing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office\u0027s waiting silence closed around them. He still hadn\u0027t taken his hand off her, and she hadn\u0027t insisted, by word or motion, that he do it. Her eyes met his, and she felt a jolt deep inside, something warm and frighteningly real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you\u0027d stayed in the hospital,\" he said, his voice low and hoarse. \"You have a hole in your side, you know. Not a hangnail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, Counselor, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a long moment, and then suddenly let go of her arm and stepped back. Two feet back. Hands in his pockets, as if he didn\u0027t trust himself not to touch her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia was coming out of the right-hand office, arms folded, looking at her shoes as if deciding whether or not the new fall line would be out soon. She glanced from Borden to Jazz and back, dark eyes glittering, and said, \"Reached any conclusions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks good to me,\" Borden said. He didn\u0027t take his eyes off Jazz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like it will work,\" Lucia replied. \"I want wireless broadband installed, and we\u0027re going to need lots of storage space. But yes, I like it. Jazz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCallender \u0026amp; Garza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen McCarthy, sitting at that black table, looking up at her with a tiny little smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz sucked in a deep breath and surprised herself by saying, \"Yeah. I can live with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, apparently, was all it took to change the course of a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cases came slowly at first. Welton Brown, who\u0027d always been a friend, directed a couple of noncriminal cases Jazz\u0027s way, and as the weeks passed, as office supplies got delivered and put away and lights turned on and Internet connections tested - as the lettering turned from dream to permanence on the reception-area wall and the building officially opened - things slowly began to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more than the bullet wound, although that closed up nicely without complications. It was more about something inside that had been broken and bleeding for much longer than that. Since she\u0027d seen Stewart throw McCarthy up against a wall and snap handcuffs around his wrist and sneer out words she still heard in her nightmares. Under arrest for murder...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been lost for a while, since then, and as she began to learn the routine of driving to the office, checking her perimeters before leaving the car, walking into the offices and being greeted by Christine Sparrow, Lucia\u0027s choice for receptionist...it began to feel real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia had moved without fanfare. She\u0027d just stopped commuting from D.C. about a week into things and handed Jazz a slip of paper with an address on it. Her new home was in one of the nicer, secured apartment buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery day, they met in the elevator, or in the coffee room, or in the administrative area - still empty - between their two offices. And every day, there was something more to talk about. Something important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia brought cases with her from Washington. One of them required travel, which Jazz wasn\u0027t up for, given her physical limitations, and she found she missed Lucia\u0027s light conversation while she was gone, the quiet competence she brought into the office, like the scent of her perfume. Jazz took a job doing background checks on a prospective executive for Hudson Industrials out of Boston - another Welton Brown referral, however oblique - and turned up drug-possession charges and proof of current cocaine purchases, provided via a subcontractor in Boston proper. The company liked their thoroughness so much that they sent over their corporate business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz discovered she really did need an assistant. Badly. She made another phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurned out that Pansy was tired of getting coffee after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree weeks later, their office staff had doubled its size, the business was running at a steady, if unexceptional, clip, and Jazz was starting to feel that little bull\u0027s eye on her back flicker and fade. Neither she nor Lucia had seen anything like a tail or a suspicious vehicle in weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just starting to feel really good and pretty well healed when Chris Sparrow rang the intercom in the middle of her transcription of the notes for the latest executive background review to announce a visitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Borden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz hesitated for a second, staring at her lit computer screen, fingers poised on the keys, and then wheeled her chair back. Lucia was gone, still, on one of her nonlocal cases. There really wasn\u0027t much of an alternative, except to tell Chris to send him on back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the open door, she witnessed the priceless moment when Pansy, coming out of the coffee room, encountered her ex-boss on his way in. They blinked at each other, and then Pansy, without a tremor, offered Borden the cup of coffee in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he, without a tremor, accepted it, toasted her with it, and continued into Jazz\u0027s office, where he took a seat on the couch, sipped coffee and sprawled as if he was sitting in his own living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make yourself at home,\" she said, and got up to close the door on Pansy\u0027s curious smile. \"I\u0027d ask what brings you here, but I\u0027m thinking I already know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout comment, Borden - who had just had a haircut, and it suited him - reached inside his trenchcoat and took out a red envelope. She walked over, took it from his hand and sat down next to him to rip it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why red?\" she asked absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished sipping his coffee before saying, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red envelopes. Seems like a pretty obvious way of delivering a message. Why red?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t believe me if I told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, that goes without saying, but humor me.\" She unfolded the paper inside. More Gabriel, Pike \u0026amp; Laskins letterhead, the same businesslike printing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProceed at 11:00 p.m. local time tonight to the 1400 block of Legacy Drive. Park on the left side of the street and wait for a black Toyota Celica to arrive and park on the opposite side of the street. Follow the woman in the Celica from her car until she enters the building at 1428 Legacy Drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Jazz checked the back of the letter. Apparently, it was. \"No pictures, no video, no nothing? Just park, follow, leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Borden said. \"I told you, they wouldn\u0027t all be exciting stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flapped the envelope. \"Why red?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we back to that again?\" He\u0027d not only cut his hair, he was freshly shaved. And if she wasn\u0027t mistaken, that was a fresh application of cologne, too. She scooted a little closer, just to confirm her suspicions. \"It\u0027s so we won\u0027t get them mixed up with other correspondence. There\u0027s a lot of it in our offices, in case you haven\u0027t noticed. Lawyers. We do paperwork.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" He put the coffee cup aside on the side table and turned toward her, resting an elbow on the back of the tufted leather couch. \"By the way, I like your hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed. She didn\u0027t mean to, and she was furious at herself for doing it, but she instantly felt the burn climb from her neck into her cheeks, and saw the immediate lazy amusement in his eyes. She\u0027d let Lucia talk her into a new hairdresser, and as a result, she barely recognized herself in the mirror. Her hair was still in a shag, but no longer reminded her of sheepdogs or thatched roofs; it looked cute, perky and fluffable. It even felt soft, thanks to some expensive conditioners she wasn\u0027t sure she could afford, or had enough training to use. But it seemed to work. Lucia had pronounced her fit for boardroom meetings, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she mumbled. \"Yours, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. No blush, damn him. \"How\u0027s the side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fixed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re taking it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m going to sign up for the Ultimate Fighting Championship cage match later today. Yes, of course I\u0027m taking it easy. The toughest thing I\u0027ve had to do so far is walk fast.\" She smiled, just a bit, as the blush started to fade to a distant prickle. \"Bet I can still kick your ass, though, Counselor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No bets,\" he said. She wondered if he was humoring her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regular rates on this?\" She waved the envelope between them, which should have formed some kind of barrier and instead just wafted more of his warm cologne toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regular rates,\" he agreed. Was he leaning closer? She thought he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to keep doing this? Being the GPL Postal Service?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"GPL?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, Pike...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" He raised one shoulder in a very tiny shrug. \"Lead time\u0027s usually not long enough to trust this stuff to the mail. Even overnight. Though sometimes I might not be available, and you might have to check FedEx, but I\u0027ll give you a heads-up first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I give you a heads-up?\" He sounded mystified by that. She had to admit, it would have been a stupid question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, why is there not enough lead time? Don\u0027t you know this stuff a couple of days ahead of time? Surely you don\u0027t do this all at the last minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her for such a long, unblinking moment that she actually felt she\u0027d said something wrong, but then he smiled and said, \"I never said we were the most organized bunch of lawyers in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered getting off the plane in New York and finding a crisply pressed ex-Marine holding up a sign with names on it. His ability to organize was, so far as she\u0027d been able to tell, pretty damn close to perfect. Like the explanation about the envelopes themselves, it didn\u0027t sound right, but she could tell that she wasn\u0027t going to get anything more from him. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re just here to deliver a letter and get back on a plane,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m here to deliver a letter, take you out to dinner, and get back on a plane,\" he said. \"You eat, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner,\" she repeated, frowning. \"You want to go to dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Early dinner, yeah. Say, six o\u0027clock? That way we\u0027ll be finished up before you have to get to work.\" He nodded slightly at the envelope in her hand, and then looked a little disconcerted. \"Unless you have plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if I have an actual life, you mean?\" She snorted. \"No. If Lucia was here, we might have a working dinner here, but no. No plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Right. Lucia\u0027s working?\" He looked guilty, as if he had forgotten about Lucia. Which Jazz had a hard time imagining, because, well, Lucia. If there was going to be a Swimsuit Edition for Private Investigator Monthly, Lucia would be the centerfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in Washington,\" Jazz said. \"Back tomorrow. But not to worry, Counselor, I can handle sitting in a car and following somebody all by myself. And dinner. I can handle dinner without backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yawned hugely, traded looking guilty for looking shocked and embarrassed, and mumbled something about early-morning flights. She cocked an eyebrow at him, got off the couch and went back to her desk. He watched her go, mouth slightly open on a question that wasn\u0027t able to quite fight its way free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stretch out,\" she said. \"You won\u0027t bother me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to typing. She didn\u0027t watch him, but after a while her peripheral vision reported that he\u0027d followed her advice. By the time she thought it was safe to focus on him again, his eyes were shut, his limbs loose and relaxed, and he was breathing evenly and quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the rise and fall of his chest, then let her eyes wander over the rest of him. Long, sleek lines, especially in the blue jeans and boots. Did he wear cowboy boots because he was coming to Kansas City? Were they some kind of special costume, like the leathers? She hoped not. She liked the idea that he wore them because he enjoyed them, not because he needed them to fit in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any transition at all, she wondered how he\u0027d look without the clothes and had to shock herself out of the vision to focus on the dry, quiet text of her report again. In her experience, the better she was able to visualize that kind of thing, the deeper she was in trouble, and that had been, well, vivid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, really vivid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimly tapped keys and forced herself to keep working as the hours slid past toward evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an out-of-towner, dinner in Kansas City required barbecue. Barbecue, in Jazz\u0027s opinion, required Arthur Bryant\u0027s, and by the time they were tucked into a booth around a Formica table, she was feeling pretty good about the choice. Not too romantic, barbecue. Not an inducement to imagine the other person naked. She didn\u0027t even order beer, which was quite a sacrifice, and stuck to soft drinks with her ribs. After an initial reluctance, Borden dove into his dinner with abandon, smearing himself with sauce and grease and mumbling praises about the taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only imagined licking him clean a few times. I really need to get out more, she thought sternly, but she was only a little bit embarrassed. He had that kind of mouth. It just...begged to be licked, especially when there were beads of Arthur Bryant sauce clinging to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was feeling relaxed and confident and happy - happy!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;when her cell phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she said, and wiped her sticky fingers clean enough to scramble for the call. She didn\u0027t immediately recognize the number. \"Hello, Jazz Callender.\" She had to stop her other ear to hear over the dull roar of the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Callender?\" An unfamiliar male voice, brisk and businesslike. \"You\u0027re listed on the notify sheet. There\u0027s been an incident at Ellsworth. Inmate Benjamin McCarthy\u0027s been the victim of a beating, and he\u0027s going to be in the hospital wing for a couple of days. No immediate life-threatening injuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt all of the happiness drain out of her, as if a plug had been pulled from the bottom of her soul. \"What happened?\" Her tone had changed, and her body language; she saw Borden straighten up and watch her, leaning forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unclear at the present time, ma\u0027am.\" In other words, they didn\u0027t want to say. \"We\u0027re looking into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes tight enough to see white stars. \"Injuries?\" She sounded just as businesslike as he did. \"Be straight with me, sir. I\u0027m his ex-partner. You know he used to be a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am, I know.\" No emotion in his voice. \"He has some busted ribs, a broken arm and a cracked collarbone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long hesitation. \"Not to my knowledge, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered all over. She felt sick, hot, disoriented, and the smell of good food and the sound of casual conversation was too much. \"Visitation?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been instructed to tell you that he can have visitors for one hour tomorrow, from noon until one o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up and dropped the phone back in her coat pocket. When she opened her eyes again, she saw that Borden was leaning back in his chair, motioning for the waitress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting the check,\" he said. \"Doesn\u0027t look like you\u0027re in the mood for this right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a hot, hard surge of gratitude that made her eyes sting with tears. He was careful not to look at her, and she was grateful for that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your partner? McCarthy?\" he asked. She nodded. \"He okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She pulled in a damp, shaking breath. \"It was just a matter of time. Could have been worse, I guess. They\u0027ll let me see him tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden finally focused on her face, then turned to smile at the waitress and do the mechanical duty of paying the check and boxing up the rest of the food to go. \"You\u0027re crazy if you think I\u0027m leaving any of this on the table,\" he said. \"Besides, I\u0027ll need something for breakfast in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breakfast?\" she blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m interested,\" Borden said. \"I\u0027d like to meet the guy you\u0027re so sure is innocent. If you don\u0027t mind having a lawyer escort you to the prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat closed up. She wasn\u0027t sure what it was she was feeling - a dizzying, hot, disorienting mix of fear, anger, pain, guilt, relief...just that it nearly undid her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden reached over and took her hand. Sticky fingers. She gripped them with desperate intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she whispered. \"But I thought you had to fly back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vacation day,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered her couch for the night, but Borden, with impeccable instincts, took a cab to a four-star hotel instead. No kiss, nothing like a romantic goodbye unless you counted a skimming touch of his fresh-washed fingers over the back of her neck and a reminder to be careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands in her pockets, watching the cab pull away, and felt the crackle of paper. She checked her watch and found she still had an hour to get to the address on the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never wanted to do anything less in her life, but driving to Ellsworth right now wouldn\u0027t do her any good. They wouldn\u0027t let her see him, and Ben wouldn\u0027t thank her for any female hysteria anyway. No, she needed to focus on something else. Get calm. Get cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegacy Drive was near a lot of clubs, and the late hour made parking tough. She circled the block for several minutes before she caught a break with a Cadillac pulling away from the curb on the left-hand side of the street of the correct block. Quickly she parallel parked between an SUV and a dusty pickup. A muffled rhythmic bass thump from the country bar down the block shivered through metal and skin as she killed the engine, slightly out of tempo with the headache throbbing in her temples. Focus. She checked the car\u0027s clock and found that she had fifteen minutes to spare before eleven. She turned off the dome light and made sure everything she needed was ready, including the digital camera, though Borden had told her she wouldn\u0027t need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, because she had nothing else to occupy her head, she thought about what might have happened to land Ben McCarthy in the prison hospital, and what that significant pause on the other end of the phone had meant when she\u0027d asked about any other injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her fault. Her fault for letting him down, for not pushing his case to the top of the list. For not turning down these crazy assignments. Watch a woman park and walk to her building? What the hell was that about? They could\u0027ve gotten anyone for that. They didn\u0027t need her. And she\u0027d let other things get in the way, too. What right did she have to be out talking and laughing and eating Arthur Bryant\u0027s barbecue when her best friend, her partner, was getting the hell beat out of him and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes, sucked in a hard, hurting breath, and deliberately let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt just before eleven - minutes before - she saw a couple walk out of the cowboy bar down the block and stagger to a truck parked across from her on the right side of the street. They managed to get doors unlocked with a minimum of giggling and groping, and wove off down the road, hopefully to a destiny that involved flashing lights and DUI citations. She was considering phoning in a tip when headlights turned the corner behind her, and she saw a car coming, moving slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt slowed even further as the driver spotted the empty space and executed a smooth parallel-parking maneuver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack Toyota Celica, furred with a light coating of road dust. As Jazz watched, the driver opened up a vanity mirror, and as the light bathed her face, Jazz saw an attractive middle-aged woman with dark, shoulder-length hair checking her lipstick. That didn\u0027t take long. The driver opened her door and stepped out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz let her get a few steps away before noiselessly opening her own car door and crossing the street, keeping out of the harsh pools of light near the corner. The woman was wearing a dress, and her high heels tapped concrete as she walked up the street. She had a notebook in her hand, and a penlight, evidently consulting an address. As Jazz hung back in the shadow of a large truck, the woman scanned building numbers, spotted the one she was looking for, and headed decisively in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz checked for anyone watching or following, but the night was quiet and the street was clear. She was the only tail in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved carefully as the woman jogged up the steps to 1428 Legacy Drive and pressed buttons. Jazz got close enough to see which one was pressed - bottom left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe access gate buzzed. The woman entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0027s it, Jazz thought, and watched the door snap shut again behind her. Whatever they thought would happen, didn\u0027t. Obviously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched for a while longer, waiting to see if anything interesting would come along, but apart from a few more amorous couples exiting the dance club, nothing popped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to her car and checked the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven-fifteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five thousand dollars,\" she said aloud as she backed out of the parking space and headed home. \"You people are totally insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped off at a bar on the way back, and after a few shots, she no longer felt the raw ripping edges of fear over what she was going to see at Ellsworth in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was worse than she\u0027d thought, and better than she\u0027d hoped. Ben looked different, lying in a hospital bed with tubes in his arms and splints and bandages all over him, but not that much different. His smile was the same, even through puffy, bruised lips. Cool blue eyes, brush-cut medium-brown hair that looked longer than she remembered. Some gray in it, maybe a bit more than the last time she\u0027d been by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jazz,\" he said. His voice sounded muffled and indistinct. She could hear him breathing. \"Sorry about the mess. Slipped in the shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down in the chair next to his bed, suddenly unable to find anything to say. McCarthy didn\u0027t give her much of a chance. He skipped his attention away from her to lock on to Borden, who was standing behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re new,\" he said. \"Let me guess. Lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at him. Borden\u0027s smile remained cool and tightly controlled. \"I\u0027m a friend,\" he said. \"Why? Do you need a lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lawyers got me where I am today,\" McCarthy said. \"Pull up a chair. I hate people looking down at me. Then again, you\u0027re so tall you\u0027ll probably look down on me anyway...so. Jazz. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was speechless, again. He looked at her, clearly waiting, and she felt an insane urge to laugh. This was pure McCarthy. Lying here hooked up to tubes, bubbling blood in a punctured lung, with broken bones and a morphine drip, demanding to know how her life was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was it?\" she heard herself ask him. McCarthy\u0027s blue eyes suddenly went shadowed, twilight cold, half-hidden by lowered lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not your problem,\" he said. \"It\u0027s like Vegas inside Ellsworth, sweetheart. What happens here stays here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had things to ask him, but there was no way she could put it into words, no way that she could imagine him letting down his guard in any way. Especially not with Borden here. She\u0027d seen the shields go all the way to full strength the second he\u0027d seen Borden at her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know,\" she said. \"I want to know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile flashed again, but it didn\u0027t reach the rest of his face. \"No, you don\u0027t,\" he said. \"No reason for that. Look, it happened, it wasn\u0027t fun, it\u0027s over. I\u0027ll take care of what needs to be taken care of, yeah? But I need you to do something for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded wordlessly, watching him. His hand suddenly shot out and wrapped around hers, tight and warm. McCarthy had always been the kind to touch, to put a hand on her shoulder, an arm around her shoulders. A celebratory kiss on her temple when things went well. Nothing sexual about it, just...family. As close as could ever matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes were intense and dark with emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to stop coming here,\" he said. \"I need to forget what it\u0027s like out there if you want me to survive in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" She held on to his hand when he tried to pull it away. \"No, dammit, Ben, I\u0027m not giving up. I\u0027ll find a way to get you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it, Jazz. I mean it. Stewart\u0027s trying to bury you, too, and if you give him an excuse he\u0027ll do it. Forget me. Move on.\" His eyes flicked suddenly from her to Borden, then back. \"I hear you\u0027re working freelance these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think Stewart comes to see me? Keeps me up-to-date on all the gossip? I hear you\u0027ve got a P.I. license. He can get it pulled, he hears you doing anything you shouldn\u0027t be into. Be careful.\" He studied her through those bruised, wary eyes. \"What are you handling? Routine stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said. It was partially true, anyway. \"I have - \" She was about to tell him, I have a partner, but the words stuck in her throat. She wasn\u0027t sure if saying it would be a reassurance, or a betrayal. \"Lighten up, Ben, it\u0027s not like I can\u0027t take care of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he agreed. His thumb skimmed gently over her bruised, abraded knuckles. He had big, square hands, disfigured now with bruises and cuts where he\u0027d defended himself. They looked like they\u0027d been in the same fight. \"Wild woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself grinning, suddenly. \"Saved your ass a few times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than a few, yeah. But you need to pick your battles. Can\u0027t make war against the world.\" He looked somber, as if what he was saying applied to himself as much as her. \"You do what I said last time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer, because she didn\u0027t want to out-and-out lie to him. The last time she\u0027d been to Ellsworth - the day she\u0027d met James Borden, she realized with a shock, had it really been that long ago?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ben had told her in no uncertain terms to box up the files she was keeping on his case and send them to his attorney. Not that his attorney had ever done him a damn bit of good that she remembered. Skinny little kid, looked more like an actor than a real lawyer...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself glancing over her shoulder at Borden. He was chatting with a nurse, head bent, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t look like a real lawyer, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get you out of here,\" she said aloud, not quite looking at Ben because it was easier than facing those eyes, that silent whisper of things done and endured she didn\u0027t want to know. \"Swear to God, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God put me here,\" McCarthy said, and shrugged. He put on a false Irish comic-opera lilt. \"It\u0027ll take the devil himself to get me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jerked her attention back to his face. \"Then I\u0027ll deal with the devil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy sent that unreadable look again, to Borden, who was still talking to the nurse and well out of earshot. \"Believe it or not, sweetheart, I think you already did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she left the prison, Jazz felt exhausted, shaky and desperately in need of a nap. She let Borden have the wheel heading back, and fell asleep to the rhythmic hiss of tires on asphalt and the soft wail of the radio. If she dreamed, it was probably unpleasant, but she didn\u0027t remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rolled back into Kansas City in time for rush hour, which Borden negotiated with ease - he would, she supposed, being from the Big Apple - and she realized by the time they\u0027d pulled into her apartment parking lot that she had barely said a word to him since entering the prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he pulled the brake, she looked over at him and said, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For...not trying to make me believe he\u0027s guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s guilty. And what I think doesn\u0027t matter, it\u0027s what you think. You took on the job to have the resources to find out, right? You should use them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even though he told you not to try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled slightly, and tasted bitterness. \"Especially since he said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden finished the business of unbuckling himself from the seat, turning off the engine, and handing her the keys before he asked, \"Are you going to see him again? Even though he told you not to go back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t do everything I\u0027m told,\" she shot back, and got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have sworn he muttered, \"I think you mean anything,\" but when she checked, his face was polite and bland, and he had the good sense not to smirk about having the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of habit, she grabbed a paper from the dispenser near the mailboxes, then collected the daily mail carrier\u0027s allotment of bills and circulars. Took the stairs. She had started taking the stairs again as soon as she was sure the sutures wouldn\u0027t tear loose, and now she was nearly back up to strength, able to trot up the six flights at a good clip without elevating her heart rate more than a few beats a minute. Borden loped next to her without breathing hard, too. Like Lucia, he was a runner. She wondered if he was a swimmer, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the vision of Borden in a Speedo out of her head with a heroic effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the apartment she dumped the mail on the kitchen table as she poured herself a tall glass of orange juice, then another for Borden when she remembered her manners. She sorted through things one-handed, absentmindedly, thinking over how McCarthy had looked, how he\u0027d acted...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in the act of shoving the newspaper aside and pulled it slowly toward her, then unfolded the front page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Borden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up a finger for silence, reading, and then turned the front page toward him and pointed to the black-and-white photo of a woman on the front. \"Her,\" she said. \"I recognize her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I followed her last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to the article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendy Blankenship, 42, was found dead in an alley near the bar where she worked. She was last seen yesterday evening at six o\u0027clock by co-workers, who described it as a \"normal day.\" \"She didn\u0027t seem different or anything,\" said Janelle Vincent, who covers alternate night shifts at Jaye\u0027s Tavern. \"She just clocked out and went home like usual. It\u0027s terrible, you know? She was just getting her life back together. She was like a den mother around here, we\u0027re going to miss her so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolice have not released the details, but have confirmed that they believe Blankenship\u0027s death is a homicide, and are searching for witnesses to put together a timeline of events leading up to her death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no mention of time of death, but Jazz had a sick feeling that she would have been one of the last people to see Wendy Blankenship alive. She remembered Wendy checking her lipstick and walking down the street to the building. Buzzing the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast one on the bottom left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew,\" she said, and looked up at Borden. He paused in the act of raising his orange juice to his lips. \"You knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knew what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give me that crap! Why else would you send me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the glass down carefully and extended his hand for the paper. She watched him read the entire article, face composed and emotions hidden, and when he was done he folded the paper again and set it on the table between them without meeting her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said hoarsely. \"I don\u0027t know why we sent you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit. Why didn\u0027t you have me stop her? Save her? I was right there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, then, and she saw the suffering in his eyes. \"I don\u0027t know, Jazz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him for a few long seconds, then reached over and picked up the cordless phone and dialed a number from memory. \"Yeah,\" she said to the woman who answered. \"I need to speak to Detective Stewart. I have some information about a murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" Borden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s worse if I wait,\" she said to him. \"They\u0027ll have surveillance footage, security-camera video, something. If Stewart thinks I\u0027m hiding something...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you save her?\" she screamed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at her, stark and pale, and shook his head. \"Because we can\u0027t save everybody,\" he said, and he sounded just as sick as she felt. \"Because it isn\u0027t possible. You know that, Jazz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell does this stuff come from?\" she demanded. \"All this...this...bullshit! Go here, watch this, videotape this - ? Who tells you where to send me? Who tells you why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so intent on his answer that the appearance of Lucia in the kitchen doorway made her flinch. Lucia, looking sleek and dark and dangerous, put down her black nylon bag and backpack, crossed her arms, and said, \"I knocked. I guess you were too busy screaming at the top of your lungs to hear.\" She transferred that fierce black look to Borden. \"She asked you a question, Counselor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Me, too. I\u0027m just as tired as she is of the cloak-and-dagger, and I\u0027d be willing to bet I\u0027m just all-around more tired, period. Tell us, or get out and take your red envelopes with you.\" Lucia couldn\u0027t possibly have a clue what they were arguing about, but you\u0027d never have known it from the self-possession she displayed - then again, hell, for all Jazz knew, Lucia had the apartment wired for sound and vision. Maybe she knew everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden looked from one of them to the other, wordlessly, and Jazz didn\u0027t blink. Neither, so far as she could tell, did Lucia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to make a phone call,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then dial,\" Lucia said softly. \"Before we pick up the phone and tell Detective Stewart everything we know about Gabriel, Pike \u0026amp; Laskins. You put my partner in a compromising position, Mr. Borden. I don\u0027t think I like that very much. Make amends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe visibly swallowed. Jazz might have felt sorry for him, except the fierce gratitude and pride she was feeling for Lucia crowded all of that out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached in his pocket and retrieved his cell phone, and dialed. \"Yeah,\" he said slowly. \"It\u0027s Borden. I need to take Callender and Garza to the next level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. His eyes fixed on the newspaper lying folded on the table. The picture of Wendy Blankenship, who hadn\u0027t survived the night that Jazz Callender barely remembered after the blur of drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"I understand.\" He hung up and looked at each of them in turn, Jazz last. His eyes were asking her for something, but she couldn\u0027t understand what it was, and she wasn\u0027t in the mood to grant him any favors anyway. \"We need to go downstairs,\" he said. \"Right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got off a plane,\" Lucia said. \"Mind if I change clothes first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I do,\" he said. \"There\u0027s a car waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" For the first time, Jazz actually saw Lucia thrown off her stride. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden didn\u0027t answer. Jazz, after a few unmoving seconds, answered for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They knew,\" she said. \"They had to know all of this before it happened. Why else would they have a car here, now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s insane,\" Lucia said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"Like hiring two people who don\u0027t know each other. Like paying them to set up a detective agency and carry out assignments that don\u0027t have any purpose. That\u0027s insane, too. Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia stared at her, a frown grooved over her eyebrows, a light in her eyes that Jazz hadn\u0027t seen before. Wary. Mistrustful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s crazy,\" she repeated slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jazz agreed. \"My point exactly.\" She turned to Borden. \"Let\u0027s go see the wizard, Tin Man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t just a car downstairs, it was a limousine. A big, black stretch limo, with tinted windows and a uniformed chauffeur who looked vaguely familiar. Jazz blinked at the sight of him - it was odd, seeing a stretch limo and a liveried driver on the streets of Kansas City - but it was Lucia who said, \"We\u0027ve met you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver doffed his cap and nodded with military precision. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he said, and Jazz remembered. Same driver from New York City, from the visit to the Gabriel, Pike \u0026amp; Laskins offices, only more formally dressed and captaining a bigger land yacht. He opened the back door and handed Lucia inside, then reached for Jazz, who avoided him and climbed in on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Laskins, Borden\u0027s boss, was the sole occupant of the car. He was dressed in another natty suit, this one charcoal-gray, with a navy tie and a diamond stickpin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Garza. Ms. Callender.\" Laskins offered them a gentlemanly nod. \"I understand you have questions. That\u0027s perfectly reasonable. I\u0027m authorized to answer them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz had been prepared to argue, but his easy, courteous manner threw her off stride. Not so Lucia, who stepped in to say, \"Fine. Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s simpler than you might think,\" Laskins said, and raised thick eyebrows. \"I\u0027m just like you. I\u0027m an Actor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz heard the capital A. Didn\u0027t understand what it meant, but she heard the emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the thick, tinted divider behind him. The limo pulled into traffic, smooth as silk. Jazz fisted her hands. She felt helpless, moving out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means what, exactly?\" Lucia asked. \"Conspiracy theory dinner theater on the weekends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will give you a very simple overview of what we - or, more properly, the Cross Society - now know about the world, Ms. Garza. There are two kinds of people in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only two?\" Lucia murmured, sounding amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For our purposes, yes. There are Actors and Chorus. At any given time on this planet, out of the billions of human lives being lived, only a handful - about ten thousand, all together - are doing anything that really matters on a larger scale. These are people we term Actors. Everyone else...\" Laskins made a languid, elegant motion with one hand. \"Chorus. Extras, if you will. It isn\u0027t the same ten thousand from moment to moment, understand. Almost every life on Earth will experience at least one decision, one event in their life that has large ripples of consequence - almost everyone moves from Chorus to Actor once in their lives. But it turns out, rather unexpectedly, that once you begin to analyze the world in this manner you find that it doesn\u0027t look as random as you would expect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Lucia said. She did sound interested, though Jazz had ceased to have any investment somewhere around the Actor/Chorus explanation, which was a load of horseshit; she was waiting for Laskins to stop spinning fairy tales and get to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, Laskins focused his gaze on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid not,\" she said, and shrugged. He sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever heard the old adage, nothing succeeds like success? Or, it takes money to make money? They share a common theme. The more you have of one thing, the natural tendency is that similar things attract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea what the hell you\u0027re saying,\" Jazz said. \"Can we move on to the part where you tell me why you had me let a woman die last night? Because that\u0027s the part I\u0027m really fascinated about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaskins\u0027s smile vanished. He looked tired and old and, suddenly, unhappy. \"I wish I could explain it to you in a way that made sense. I can\u0027t, not really, but I\u0027ll try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certain people are never Chorus in this life, Jasmine. They are, quite simply, always Actors. Everything they do ripples and has consequences, even the smallest thing. They are rare, these...Leads. We have identified perhaps a hundred of them. The woman that you were asked to follow was a Lead, and you were there to counter a move by the opposition. It was the right move, but it simply failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We put you in place to save her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limo made a right turn. Jazz glanced out the windows, half-claustrophobic, and saw that they were on the back side of the office building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. \"Hate to break it to you, but it didn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Laskins said quietly. \"I\u0027d like to tell you that it was a foolproof system. It doesn\u0027t always work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t always work out?\" Jazz repeated hotly. \"She\u0027s dead! If she\u0027s so damn important and you knew she was in danger, why didn\u0027t you use one of those - those Actors or Leads or whatever to protect her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaskins leaned forward, fixed her with a look, and said, very softly, \"We did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden sucked in a breath. Jazz looked sharply at him, but he didn\u0027t say anything. He avoided her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you telling me that I\u0027m a - whatever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. A Lead. Both of you are. That\u0027s why we chose you. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve financed you, and we\u0027ve put you in a position to do things on our behalf. Because you can. Because you must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess the fact that Wendy\u0027s dead in the morgue is proof that you\u0027re all insane,\" Jazz said grimly. Lucia, next to her, was oddly quiet, watching Laskins. \"If we\u0027re so important, why the hell haven\u0027t we made any difference? You know what? This is useless. You\u0027re all crazy, and I\u0027m out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved on Borden, trying to get him to move, but he was more solid than he looked, and she was hampered by the close confines of the car. He didn\u0027t look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have made a difference,\" Borden said. \"Jazz, listen to me. I know what we\u0027re saying sounds crazy - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me out!\" Jazz was half-standing now, furious, reaching over Borden for the door handle. He grabbed her hand and held it, trying to get her to look at him; she flatly refused. She was shaking all over. \"Dammit, I\u0027m done, do you hear me? Let me the hell out now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t Borden who stopped her from getting out, it was Lucia. Lucia\u0027s quiet voice, unnaturally calm. \"The woman loading boxes in the van,\" she said. \"The first job we did for you. She was going to be killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hadn\u0027t been there, yes. At least, we think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we put the chaos in chaos theory,\" Lucia said, leaning forward, hands clasped between her knees. \"It\u0027s like chess, isn\u0027t it. You move us like pieces on a board. We\u0027re pawns, protecting your bishops and knights and castles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sell yourself short,\" Laskins grunted in reply. \"Pawns don\u0027t rate this explanation. And although Wendy Blankenship had the potential to become important, she wasn\u0027t a castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re any good at chess,\" Lucia continued, \"then you know there are a limited number of outcomes when you have three pieces interacting - especially if the point is to take one of the pieces off the board. Why didn\u0027t you warn Jazz and let her save Wendy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of this is an exact science, Ms. Garza. Every action, by any of the Actors at the moment, can turn events. We can\u0027t warn against specifics, because we only are sure of generalities. We knew Ms. Blankenship was marked for death, and indeed, we couldn\u0027t find an outcome in which she didn\u0027t die. But we chose the moment most likely to make a difference. If events had gone a bit differently, if their Actor had made an error, Jazz would have saved her. But sometimes it isn\u0027t possible.\" To his credit, Laskins sounded almost as if he gave a damn. \"Chess is my specialty. And the focus is not upon pieces that will inevitably be lost, but on making that sacrifice meaningful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You used Jazz to take out the killer, after the fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We put her in a position where she could provide the police with a vital lead, yes, without placing her in danger. She\u0027s already taken far too many risks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz parted her lips to fire off a response, but nothing came to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said,\" Laskins continued, \"chess is my specialty. And while this isn\u0027t the outcome we\u0027d hoped for, it\u0027s far from a lost cause. Jazz can safely come forward with her information, and we achieve our goal in a different way. We stopped a serial killer, who will shortly leave the chess-board himself, and we did it with only inevitable losses. It isn\u0027t always about bullets and bombs, you know, Ms. Garza. Or lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must have been a hidden message in that. Jazz saw a flicker in Lucia\u0027s eyes, a downright flinch in her body language. \"If you\u0027re playing chess,\" Lucia asked, \"who do you play against? And don\u0027t tell me God. I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re quite that good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe privacy screen between them and the driver suddenly eased down with a whir, and their ex-Marine chauffeur turned to look back at them. \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but you wanted to know when the other car left. It\u0027s leaving now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Charles,\" Laskins said, and checked his expensive watch. \"Right on time. I\u0027m sorry, Ms. Garza, but we\u0027ll have to cut this meeting short. Some things simply won\u0027t be postponed, as I\u0027m sure you can appreciate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer my question first,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Laskins nodded toward the door. \"Charles, if you please - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia, without seeming to be in a big hurry or doing anything important, reached around and pulled out her gun. She pointed it directly at Laskins. \"Nothing personal,\" she said, with a hint of a smile, \"but I\u0027d really like an answer to my question first. And Charles, don\u0027t do anything foolish, please, because two of us shooting in here really won\u0027t help the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaskins threw out a warning hand to the Marine. \"Interesting. There was only a very small chance that you would do that, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027re wearing bulletproof armor under that Hugo Boss suit, I don\u0027t think that means much,\" Lucia replied. They exchanged cool little smiles. \"How is it done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is what done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz jumped in. \"The fortune-telling. What do you have? Tarot cards? A crystal ball? Twelve thousand monkeys with calculators?\" She knew she sounded sarcastic, and didn\u0027t give a damn. This was scary. The fact that Lucia was buying it downright terrified her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaskins gave her a narrow, sour smile. \"No. We have a few people who do these things - freaks of nature, if you will. But the rest of us apply science, not superstition. It might surprise you to know there are solid, scientific methods that can be applied to the problem of alternative realities. String theory, for instance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a psychic,\" Lucia cut in. \"Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You could say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why all the chess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what happens,\" Laskins said irritably, \"when you have two psychics who both want to win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia glanced aside at Jazz, who hadn\u0027t quite figured out a move, either. At least, nothing that wouldn\u0027t compromise Lucia\u0027s. \"You believing anything he\u0027s told us?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe that I\u0027m going to report seeing Wendy Blankenship buzz herself into that apartment,\" Jazz said. \"I would have done that, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need a cover story. Some reason you were on the street and saw her,\" Lucia replied. \"I can handle that part, back-engineer an assignment you were on. It\u0027ll check out.\" She transferred attention back to the two facing them - not, Jazz suspected, that it had ever really wandered. \"Mr. Laskins, you have ten seconds to answer me before my partner and I exit this vehicle and your plans, forever. If you know anything at all about me, you know that I mean what I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Laskins said sourly. \"I know you mean it, Garza. But use your common sense. The Cross Society is giving you information, and you\u0027re acting upon it. Do you really think you can just walk away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, I think I can. And should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the moment our psychic - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Max Simms?\" Jazz asked. Laskins cut his steely Paul Newman stare her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, fine, Max Simms. From the moment you appeared in his visions, you became important. We got to you first. That made you targets - low-priority, at present - for the opposition. You will be targets for as long as you continue to be Actors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we quit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfectly good question, but Laskins\u0027s smile got wider. \"You can\u0027t, Ms. Callender. Not of your own accord. For as long as the greater forces of the universe - God, the devil, or chance - deem you an Actor, you will remain one. But don\u0027t worry. Eventually, it will be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jazz snapped. \"Eventually we all die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaskins didn\u0027t bother to deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaskins said, \"We\u0027ve reached a hard stop, Ms. Garza. You can either shoot me, which would have a less than pleasant outcome for both you and your partner, or you can exit the limousine and refuse to take any further support or information from us. But if you do that, you cut yourselves off. You\u0027ve been marked as Leads, both of you. What you do matters. Everything you do matters, one way or another. You\u0027re targets, as surely as Wendy Blankenship, and you\u0027ll end up just the same if we don\u0027t help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like threats.\" Lucia almost purred it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t a threat,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t need to be. You\u0027ve become part of what we are. Our enemies know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia smiled and looked at Jazz. It was crazy, weird, exhilarating, the way the two of them communicated. The way things hummed at moments like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Jazz said, \"I suck at chess, but I love contact sports.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn some unseen signal, Charles pulled the limo in at the curb again. Lucia reached over and opened her door. \"The thing about hiring what you call Leads? We aren\u0027t going to always do what you tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t, people will die,\" Laskins said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did what you asked. Blankenship\u0027s still dead,\" Jazz said. Lucia slid smoothly out of the limousine. She scooted over to follow. \"Don\u0027t call us. Oh, and those red letters? Stuff them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back, one last time, at James Borden. He was staring at her as if he was trying to memorize everything about her in the last second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you, Counselor,\" she said, and shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limo pulled away, accelerating fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Lucia stood on the empty street in front of the apartment building, staring after it. Lucia absently holstered her gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said. \"That was...unusual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is so unusual for us, these days,\" Jazz agreed blandly. She didn\u0027t feel bland. She felt wired, juiced, jittery, more alive than she had in months. As if she\u0027d finally found...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia turned toward her. \"Do you want to stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit. Dissolve the partnership. Go separate ways.\" Lucia nodded after the limo\u0027s taillights. \"Clearly, these people are insane. It\u0027s probably far better that we get out now, before the damage is permanent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jazz agreed softly. \"They\u0027re crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you want to quit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. There were cars coming. Jazz glanced at the distant oncoming headlights, then met Lucia\u0027s eyes and held them. \"No,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to quit. Not the partnership, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s smile was warm, wicked and utterly crazy. \"Neither do I. This is just about to get...interesting.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-bargain-red-letter-days-1/page-6.html","bookId":2310,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:03 PM"}
