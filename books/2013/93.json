Stepping into the elder’s path he bowed and said, ‘I greet you, Tomad Sengar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistracted, the older Tiste Edur frowned at him. ‘Den-Ratha. What do you wish from me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A word or two, no more than that. I am Bruthen Trana-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘One of Rhulad’s sycophants.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Alas, no. I was appointed early in the regime to oversee the Letherii security organization known as the Patriotists. As part of my responsibilities, I was to report to the Emperor in person each week. As of yet, I have not once addressed him. The Chancellor has interposed himself and turns me away each and every time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My youngest son suckles at Gnol’s tit,’ Tomad Sengar said in a low, bitter voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is my belief,’ Bruthen Trana said, ‘that the Emperor himself is not entirely aware of the extent of the barriers the Chancellor and his agents have raised around him, Elder Sengar. Although I have sought to penetrate them, I have failed thus far.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then why turn to me, Den-Ratha? I am even less able to reach through to my son.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is the Tiste Edur who are being isolated from their Emperor,’ Bruthen said. ‘Not just you and I. All of us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hannan Mosag-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is reviled, for it is well understood that the Warlock King is responsible for all of this. His ambition, his pact with an evil god. He sought the sword for himself, did he not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then Rhulad is truly alone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana nodded, then added, ‘There is a possibility… there is one person. The Letherii woman who is his First Concubine-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A Letherii?’ Tomad snarled. ‘You must be mad. She is an agent for Gnol, a spy. She has corrupted Rhulad-how else could she remain as First Concubine? My son would never have taken her, unless she had some nefarious hold over him.’ The snarl twisted the elder’s features. ‘You are being used, warrior. You and I shall not speak again.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomad Sengar pushed him to one side and marched down the corridor. Bruthen Trana turned to watch him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing out a crimson silk cloth, Karos Invictad daubed at the sweat on his brow, his eyes fixed on the strange two-headed insect as it circled in place, round and round and round in its box cage. ‘Not a single arrangement of tiles will halt this confounded, brainless creature. I begin to believe this is a hoax.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Were it me, sir,’ Tanal Yathvanar said, ‘I would have crushed the whole contraption under heel long ago. Indeed it must be a hoax-the proof is that you have not defeated it yet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Invigilator’s gaze lifted, regarded Tanal. ‘I do not know which is the more disgusting, you acknowledging defeat by an insect, or your pathetic attempts at flattery.’ He set the cloth down on the table and leaned back. ‘The studied pursuit of solutions requires patience, and, more, a certain cast of intellect. This is why you will never achieve more than you have, Tanal Yathvanar. You totter at the very edge of your competence-ah, no need for the blood to so rush to your face, it is what you are that I find so useful to me. Furthermore, you display uncommon wisdom in restraining your ambition, so that you make no effort to attempt what is beyond your capacity. That is a rare talent. Now, what have you to report to me this fine afternoon?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Master, we have come very close to seeing our efforts extended to include the Tiste Edur.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad’s brows rose. ‘Triban Gnol has spoken to the Emperor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He has. Of course, the Emperor was shaken by the notion of traitors among the Edur. So much so that he ordered the Chancellor from the throne room. For a while.’ Tanal Yathvanar smiled. ‘A quarter-bell, apparently. The subject was not broached again that day, yet it is clear that Rhulad’s suspicions of his fellow Edur have burgeoned.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well. It will not be long, then.’ The Invigilator leaned forward again, frowning down at the puzzle box. ‘It is important that all obstacles be removed. The only words the Emperor should be hearing should come from the Chancellor. Tanal, prepare a dossier on the First Concubine.’ He looked up again. ‘You understand, don’t you, that your opportunity to free that scholar you have chained far below has passed? There is no choice now but that she must disappear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to speak, Tanal Yathvanar simply nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I note this-and with some urgency-because you have no doubt grown weary of her in any case, and if not, you should have. I trust I am understood. Would you not enjoy replacing her with the First Concubine?’ Karos smiled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-93.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
