I sent the fool away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was clearly stunned into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas half turned with a dismissive wave of one hand. ‘I sent Menandore away, too. They tried using me like a coin, something to be passed back and forth. But I know all about coins. I’ve smelled the burning stench of their touch.’ He glanced back at her again. ‘And if I am a coin, then I belong to no-one. Borrowed, occasionally. Wagered, often. Possessed? Never for long.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘T’orrud Segul-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Find someone else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have been chosen, you damned fool!’ She started forward suddenly, tearing at her own threadbare slave’s tunic. Cloth ripped, fluttered on the hot wind like the tattered fragments of some imperial flag. She was naked, reaching out to drag Udinaas round, arms encircling his neck-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis push sent her sprawling onto the hard, stony ground. ‘I’m done with rapes,’ he said in a low, grating voice. ‘Besides, I told you we have company. You clearly didn’t completely understand me-’ And he walked past her, walked straight towards the serpent that was Seren Pedac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke with a calloused hand closed about her throat. Stared up into glittering eyes in the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel him trembling above her, his weight pinning her down, and he lowered his face to hers, then, wiry beard bristling along her cheek, brought his mouth to her right ear, and began whispering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have been expecting something like that, Seren Pedac, lor some time. Thus, you had my admiration… of your restraint. Too bad, then, it didn’t last.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was having trouble breathing; the hand wrapping her throat was an iron band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I meant what I said about rapes, Acquitor. If you ever do that again, I will kill you. Do you understand me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed a nod, and she could see now, in his face, the full measure of the betrayal he was feeling, the appalling hurt. That she would so abuse him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Think nothing of me,’ Udinaas continued, ‘if that suits the miserable little hole you live in, Seren Pedac. It’s what wiped away your restraint in the first place, after all. But I have had goddesses use me. And gods try to. And now a scrawny witch I once lusted after, who dreams her version of tyranny is preferable to everyone else’s. I was a slave-I am used to being used, remember? But-and listen carefully, woman-1 am a slave no longer-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear Sengar’s voice came down from above them. ‘Release her throat, Udinaas. That which you feel at the back of your own neck is the tip of my sword-and yes, that trickle of blood belongs to you. The Acquitor is Betrothed to Trull Sengar. She is under my protection. Release her now, or die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand gripping her throat loosened, lifted clear-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Fear Sengar had one hand in the slave’s hair, was tearing him back, flinging him onto the ground, the sword hissing in a lurid blur-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘NO!’ Seren Pedac shrieked, clawing across to throw herself down onto Udinaas. ‘No, Fear! Do not touch him!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Acquitor-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers awake now, rising on all sides-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do not hurt him!’ I have done enough of that this night, ‘Fear Sengar-Udinaas, he had that right-‘Oh, Errant save me-‘He had that right,’ she repeated, her throat feeling torn on the inside from that first shriek. ‘I-listen, don’t, Fear, you don’t understand. I… I did something. Something terrible. Please…’ she was sitting up now, speaking to everyone, ‘please, this is my fault.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas pushed her weight to one side, and she scraped an elbow raw as he clambered free. ‘Make it day again, Silchas Ruin,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The night-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Make it day again, damn you! Enough sleep-let’s move on. Now!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Seren Pedac’s astonishment, the sky began to lighten once more. What? How?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas was at his bedroll, fighting to draw it together, stuff it into his pack. She saw tears glittering on his weathered cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, what have 1 done. Udinaas-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You understand too much,’ Clip said in that lilting, offhand tone of his. ‘Did you hear me, Udinaas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go fuck yourself,’ the slave muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin said, ‘Leave him, Clip. He is but a child among us. And he will play his childish games.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshes drifting down to bury her soul, Seren Pedac turned away from all of them. No, the child is me. Still. Always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve paces away, Kettle sat, legs drawn under her, and held hands with Wither, ghost of an Andii, and there was neither warmth nor chill in that grip. She stared at the others as the light slowly burgeoned to begin a new day. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-322.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
