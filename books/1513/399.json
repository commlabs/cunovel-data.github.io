Boom! Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the world was being destroyed. The earth trembled and the skies wailed. Even the sky could not hold on, forming countless spatial cracks that were quickly destroyed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previous two rank 3 Crystal Phase Magi were unable to finish a sentence before they were broken down into fragments by the flaming meteors. Following that, explosion after explosion wreaked havoc on the land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast area, with the city at the heart of it, turned into a fiery hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany Thorned Hammer Magi could not resist at all under the onslaught of the fire rain. They could only watch on in despair as they were swallowed by the flames. As Blazing Rain Of Extinction covered too large an area, any methods of escape all turned into jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a wave of the flaming rain fell, the entire Thorned Hammer corps had been exterminated. Besides the city that Kason was in, which was unharmed, the entire area had turned into a living hell. The Earth’s crust had collapsed, lava boiling, and it was as if they had arrived at an ocean of lava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pak!* The video cut off, and Leylin maintained his expression of shock, unable to come back to himself for a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The area that Lord Kason cast a spell on later turned into a region of active volcanos. Every year, it will erupt a few times, and all living creatures living within a few hundred kilometers would perish as it turned into an area of death.” Robin was still explaining to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When the power of magic is pushed to the extreme, will it create such a terrifying scene?” Leylin muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ever since that incident, all Morning Star Magi in the central continent signed an agreement that unless there were special circumstances, they could not use final techniques in the central continent, nor destroy the environment at such a large scale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin smiled wryly. The range of these Morning Star Final Techniques were too terrifying, and if not regulated, it was impossible to live on the central continent if there were more great battles. Sooner or later, they would be extinguished, similar to how the ancient era had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Phew…” Leylin sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene just now had truly astounded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he had fragments of the Scorpion Man’s memories, there were differences between Morning Star creatures and Magi. What he could feel was the terrifyingly durable body of the creature. As for the battle at the end, it was much too profound for him to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there was a Morning Star Magus that had proven to Leylin that once he advanced to the rank 4 realm, just simple spells could create a giant qualitative change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could the power of a rank 4 spell have such a frightening effect? Even if it’s a combination spell, it doesn’t make sense!” Leylin mumbled to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin shook his head, obviously thinking differently. “Haha, this is the combination final technique of a Morning Star Magus. The taboo of ancient times! How can it be compared with little combination spells? Doubling the individual strength of the spells is the apex of a combination spell’s achievement! The amplification of the final technique of a Morning Star Magus is more than ten times that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s impossible. Regular spells can’t support this consumption! Unless…” Leylin’s eyes brightened, as if he had thought of something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly, you’ve already thought of it! That’s it! Only by combining innate spells that consume little energy but have great effects can the Morning Star final technique be formed. The ancient high-grade meditation techniques are the culmination of many experiments by ancient Magi, designing innate spells that are the most suitable for combination. It is also a process that can be solidified in the sea of consciousness!” Robin immediately narrated the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There have to be four levels in a high-grade meditation technique. This is the reason! Only Magi who form their innate spells by following high-grade meditation techniques are able to combine them when they are at rank 4, forming the Morning Star final technique. That’s why the fourth level in any high-grade meditation technique is the most precious part!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then how about Magi who use Grine Water to solidify their innate spell model?” Leylin suddenly asked, and then realised the stupidity of his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grine Water, combined with an innate spell model? Is that the method to advance in your hometown? We have something like that in the central continent… Thank goodness you did not choose that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin’s expression seemed to say ‘you’re very lucky’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The combination of a Morning Star final technique is the culmination of precious experience gained by generations of experiments. The Magi who used random ways to solidify their innate spells would be extremely lucky if they were not consumed by it. To create a combination final technique? Dream on! I wouldn’t be surprised if they got themselves into an explosion!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s expression was grim. He naturally understood the difficulty in designing a final technique from scratch. Even he, with his A.I. Chip, did not have much confidence. Those Magi could only weep in despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, a smile appeared on Robin’s lips, “Now that I think about it, there are a few Morning Star Magi like that in the central continent. As many innate spells have long since been solidified, there is little opportunity to alter them. Though there are those lucky enough to rise to the rank 4 realm, they wouldn’t have a Morning Star final technique. Due to the huge consumption of their innate spells, they could only be slightly stronger than rank 3 Magi, and are viewed as a disgrace to Morning Star Magi in the central continent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So based on what senior mentioned, the final technique from high-grade meditation techniques are set by the technique?” Leylin suddenly had a question, “Then at the fourth level of our Kemoyin’s Pupil, what kind of final technique will there be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your conjecture is right! Each final technique from high-grade meditation techniques is fixed. Since innate spells are formed from high-grade meditation techniques, they cannot be changed. From the final technique, one can tell the high-grade meditation technique a Morning Star Magus trains in.” Robin nodded, “As for the Morning Star final technique of us Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks, it is the Flawless Morphing Technique.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flawless Morphing Technique?” Leylin was puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“En! Actually, almost all Warlocks develop Morning Star final techniques that are rather similar after reaching rank 4. It is similar to an flawless morphing effect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Advancement for Warlocks comes from constantly purifying the bloodline and altering the body, drawing close to the source of the bloodline. That is why after reaching the rank 4 realm, we can even use the Morphing Technique and simulate the form of a real ancient creature, as well as display all its strength!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin spoke emotionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In other words, after reaching rank four, Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks can turn into an ancient Giant Kemoyin Serpent at will?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin recalled the terrifying durability and strength of the Scorpion Man who was at the Morning Star realm. If combined with the brain and spells of Warlocks…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That truly is terrifying…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAncient bloodline creatures were originally very powerful, and even Morning Star Magi did not dare provoke Morning Star giant beasts. If combined with a Warlock’s strengths, how formidable could they become? Just the thought of it caused Leylin’s to be stirred up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see. It’s no wonder that the solidified spells of high-grade meditation techniques cannot be modified. Each level is fixed, as this is the optimum combination created by ancient Magi. With no internal friction and with the force of point mass that Morning Star Magi have condensed to the utmost, this will create a terrifying qualitative result.” Leylin immediately recalled the crimson spiritual force core crystal in his sea of consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reaching rank 3, the crystal had formed a complicated three-layered tessellated structure. The crystal of the third level had become even more intricate, the runes even more complicated and forming his innate spell Intimidating Gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the runes for Intimidating Gaze combined with the ones from before, the new rune had been a strange crimson. All that was lacking was something in the center, which could then help it fully display formidable strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is probably the prototype for my rank 4 Morning Star final technique!” Leylin sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, he was very glad that he had not used the fourth level of Kemoyin’s Pupil simulated with his A.I. Chip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, in principle, the A.I. Chip’s version was perfect, most of the high-grade meditation techniques in the subterranean world lacked a fourth level. The only one was Dragon King’s Mystic Might, which was specifically only able to be used by the dragon race, and had failed to mention all this information. Without this knowledge, there was a real possibility of Leylin suffering a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was the case, he would lose this precious opportunity and become like those poor Morning Star Magi who reached rank 4 but lacked a final technique. He too would be scorned by his peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, since he knew the principle behind this combination, through simulation with the A.I. Chip, he would be able to obtain information regarding the real fourth layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this thought, Leylin immediately commanded, “A.I. Chip, using my Warlock innate spell model as the foundation, simulate a rank 4 innate spell. Refer to the Flawless Morphing Technique as required.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Mission established. Beginning simulation. Estimated completion time: 158 years, 9 months.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs per usual, the A.I. Chip gave him an astronomical figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin rolled his eyes. When calculating anything more powerful than him, the A.I. Chip always needed a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also verified his previous notions. If he relied on himself and tried to create a reasonable final technique, it would be an impossible task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In this case, unless they have plans of destroying the core of their spiritual force and take a gamble to retrain from scratch, all the Magi who use Grime Water are doomed to be cannon fodder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin suddenly sighed. The Magus World was filled with traps and dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright, let’s go out! The introduction to Morning Star Magi shall end here.” Suddenly, Robin turned around for a moment. “Also, all this information may not be that confidential, but it’s only circulated amongst the higher-ups in a few organisations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-398\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-400\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-399","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
