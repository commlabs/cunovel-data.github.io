He stared across at Andy Thurlow, wondering at the odd, haggard look of the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in Bondelli\u0027s law office, a place of polished wood and leather-bound books aligned precisely behind glass covers, a place of framed diplomas and autographed photos of important people. It was early afternoon, a sunny day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow was bent over, elbows on knees, hands clasped tightly together. I don\u0027t dare tell him my real suspicions, he thought. I don\u0027t dare ... I don\u0027t dare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027d want to harm her or take her away?\" Bondelli asked. \"She\u0027s gone to friends, perhaps up in \u0027Frisco. It\u0027s something simple as that. We\u0027ll hear from her when she\u0027s gotten over her funk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what the police think,\" Thurlow said. \"They\u0027ve completely cleared her of any complicity in Nev\u0027s death ... the physical evidence ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the best thing we can do is get down to the necessities of Joe\u0027s case. Ruth\u0027ll come home when she\u0027s ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill she? Thurlow asked himself. He couldn\u0027t shake off the feeling that he was living in a nightmare. Had he really been with Ruth at the grove? Was Nev really dead in that weird accident? Had Ruth run off? If so, where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have to dive directly into the legal definition of insanity,\" Bondelli said. \"Nature and consequences. Justice requires ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Justice?\" Thurlow stared at the man. Bondelli had turned in his chair, revealing his profile, the mouth thinned to a shadowline beneath the mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Justice,\" Bondelli repeated. He swiveled to look at Thurlow. Bondelli prided himself upon his judgment of men and he studied Thurlow now. The psychologist appeared to be coming out of his blue funk. No question why the man was so shaken, of course. Still in love with Ruth Murphey ... Hudson. Terrible mess, but it\u0027d shake down. Always did. That was one thing you learned from the law; it all came out in court. Thurlow took a deep breath, reminded himself that Bondelli wasn\u0027t a criminal lawyer. \"We ought to be more interested in realism,\" he said. There was an undertone of wry cynicism in his voice. Justice! \"This legal definition of insanity business is a lot of crap. The important thing is that the community wants the man executed --and our benighted D.A., Mr. Paret, is running for reelection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli was shocked. \"The law\u0027s above that!\" He shook his head. \"And the whole community isn\u0027t against Joe. Why should they be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow spoke as though to an unruly child: \"Because they\u0027re afraid of him, naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli permitted himself a glance out the window beside his desk --familiar rooftops, distant greenery, a bit of foggy smoke beginning to cloud the air above the adjoining building. The smoke curled and swirled, creating an interesting pattern against the view. He returned his attention to Thurlow, said: \"The question is, how can an insane man know the nature and consequences of his act? What I want from you is to explode that nature and consequences thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow removed his glasses, glances at them, returned them to his nose. They made the shadows stand out sharply in the room. \"An insane man doesn\u0027t think about consequences,\" he said. And he wondered if he was really going to let himself take part in Bondelli\u0027s mad plan for defense of Joe Murphey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking the position,\" Bondelli said, \"that the original views of Lord Cottenham support our defense.\" Bondelli turned, pulled a thick book out of a cabinet behind him, put the book on the desk and opened it to a marker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can\u0027t be serious, Thurlow thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s Lord Cottenham,\" Bondelli said. \"It is wrong to listen to any doctrine which proposes the punishment of persons laboring under insane delusions. It is inconceivable that the man who was incapable of judging between right and wrong, of knowing whether an act were good or bad, ought to be made accountable for his actions; such a man has not that within him which forms the foundation of accountability, either from a moral or a legal point of view. I consider it strange that any person should labor under a delusion and yet be aware that it was a delusion: in fact, if he were aware of his state, which could be no delusion.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli closed the book with a snap, stared at Thurlow as though to say: \"There! It\u0027s all solved!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow cleared his throat It was increasingly obvious that Bondelli lived in a cloud world. \"That\u0027s all very true, of course,\" Thurlow said. \"But isn\u0027t it possible that even if our esteemed district attorney suspects --or even believes --Joe Murphey to be insane, he\u0027ll think it better to execute such a man than to put him in an institution?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good heavens! Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doors of mental hospitals sometimes open,\" Thurlow said. \"Paret was elected to protect this community --even from itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Murphey\u0027s obviously insane!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t listening to me,\" Thurlow said. \"Certainly he\u0027s insane. That\u0027s what people are afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But shouldn\u0027t psychology ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psychology!\" Thurlow snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli stared at Thurlow in shocked silence. \"Psychology\u0027s just the modern superstition,\" Thurlow said. \"It can\u0027t do a damned thing for people like Joe. I\u0027m sorry but that\u0027s the truth and it\u0027ll hurt less to have that out right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If this is what you told Ruth Murphey, no wonder she ran away,\" Bondelli said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Ruth I\u0027d help any way I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a strange way of showing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Thurlow said. \"We\u0027ve a community up in aims, fearful, excited. Murphey\u0027s the focus for their hidden guilt feelings. They want him dead. They want this psychological pressure taken off them. You can\u0027t psychoanalyze a whole community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli began tapping a finger impatiently on the desk. \"Will you or will you not help me prove Joe\u0027s insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do everything I can, but you know Joe\u0027s going to resist that form of defense, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know it!\" Bondelli leaned forward, arms on his desk. \"The damn\u0027 fool blows his top at the slightest hint I want him to plead insanity. He keeps harping on the unwritten law!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those stupid accusations against Adele,\" Thurlow said. \"Joe\u0027s going to make it very difficult to prove him insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sane man would fake insanity now if only to save his life,\" Bondelli said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep that very clearly in mind,\" Thurlow said. \"Joe can\u0027t in any way entertain the idea that he\u0027s insane. To admit that --even as a possibility --or as a necessary pretense, he\u0027d have to face the fact that his violent act could\u0027ve been a useless, senseless thing. The enormity of such an admission would be far worse than insanity. Insanity\u0027s much preferable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you get that across to a jury?\" Bondelli asked. He spoke in a hushed tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Murphey considers it safer to play sane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow shrugged. \"Who knows what a jury will believe? Joe may be a hollow shell, but that\u0027s one helluva strong shell. Nothing contradictory can be permitted to enter it. Every fiber of him is concentrated on the necessity to appear normal, to maintain the illusion of sanity --for himself as well as for others. Death is far preferable to that other admission ... Oscar Wilde concurring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Each man kills the thing he loves,\u0027\" Bondelli whispered. Again, he turned, looked out the window. The smoky pattern was still there. He wondered idly if workmen were tarring a roof somewhere below him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow looked down at Bondelli\u0027s tapping finger. \"The trouble with you, Tony,\" he said, \"is you\u0027re one of G. K. Chesterton\u0027s terrible children. You\u0027re innocent and love justice. Most of us are wicked and naturally prefer mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though he hadn\u0027t heard, Bondelli said: \"We need something simple and elegant to show the jury. They have to be dumbfounded with the realization that ... \" He broke off, stared at Thurlow. \"And your prediction of Joe\u0027s trouble fits the bill precisely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too technical,\" Thurlow said. \"A jury won\u0027t sit still for it, won\u0027t understand it. Juries don\u0027t hear what they don\u0027t understand. Their minds wander. They think about dress patterns, bugs in the rose garden, what\u0027s for lunch, where to spend a vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did predict it, didn\u0027t you? Ruth did report your words correctly?\" \"The psychotic break, yes, I predicted it.\" The words were almost a sigh. \"Tony, haven\u0027t you focused on what I\u0027ve been telling you? This was a sex crime -- the sword, the violence ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he\u0027s insane!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the legal sense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In every sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then there\u0027s legal precedent for ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psychological precedent\u0027s more important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony, if there\u0027s one thing I\u0027ve learned since becoming court psychologist here, it\u0027s that juries, spend far more energy trying to discover the judge\u0027s opinion than they do following what the opposing lawyers are presenting. Juries have a purely disgusting respect for the wisdom of judges. Any judge we get is going to be a member of this community. The community wants Joe put away permanently --dead. We can prove him insane until we\u0027re blue in the face. None of these good people will face our proof consciously, even while they\u0027re accepting it unconsciously. In fact, as we prove Joe insane, we\u0027re condemning him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to tell me you can\u0027t get up on that stand and say you predicted Joe\u0027s insanity but the authorities refused to act because the man was too important a member of the community?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they won\u0027t believe you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t make any difference whether they believe me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if they believe ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what they\u0027ll believe, Tony, and I\u0027m surprised that you, an attorney, don\u0027t realize this. They\u0027ll believe that Paret has proof of Adele\u0027s unfaithfulness, but that some legal technicality, legal trickery on your part, prohibits introduction of the dirty details. They\u0027ll believe this because it\u0027s the easiest thing to believe. No grandstand play on my part will change that\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying we don\u0027t stand a chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow shrugged. \"Not if it goes to trial right away. If you can delay the trial or get a change of venue ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli swiveled his chair, stared through the smoke pattern outside his window. \"I find it very hard to believe that reasonable, logical human beings ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s reasonable or logical about a jury?\" Thurlow asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flush of anger began at Bondelli\u0027s collar, spread upward across his cheeks, into his hair. He turned, glared at Thurlow. \"Do you know what I think, Andy? I think the fact that Ruth ran out on you has colored your attitude toward her father. You say you\u0027ll help, but every word you ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll be enough of that,\" Thurlow interrupted, his voice low, flat. He took two deep breaths. \"Tell me something, Tony. Why\u0027re you taking this case? You\u0027re not a criminal lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli passed a hand across his eyes. Slowly, the flush left his skin. He glanced at Thurlow. \"Sorry, Andy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right. Can you answer the question? Do you know why you\u0027re taking this case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli sighed, shrugged. \"When the story broke that I was representing him, two of my most important clients called and said they\u0027d take their business elsewhere if I didn\u0027t pull out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why you\u0027re defending Joe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has to have the best defense possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the best?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to go up to San Francisco, get Belli or someone of that stature, but Joe refuses. He thinks it\u0027s going to be easy --the goddamn\u0027 unwritten law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that leaves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this city, yes.\" Bondelli extended his arms onto the desk, clasped his hands into fists. \"You know, I don\u0027t see the problem the same way you do, not at all. I think our biggest job\u0027s to prove he isn\u0027t faking insanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes. They were beginning to ache. He\u0027d been reading too much today, he thought. He said: \"Well, you have a point there, Tony. If a person with delusions learns to keep quiet about them, you can have one helluva time getting him to act on those delusions where people will see him and understand. Exposing faked insanity is easy compared with the problems of detecting a concealed psychosis, but the public generally doesn\u0027t understand this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see a four-pronged attack,\" Bondelli said. \"There\u0027re four common essentials with insane killers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow started to say something, thought better of it as Bondelli raised a hand, four fingers extended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First,\" Bondelli said, \"did the victim\u0027s death profit the killer. Psychopaths usually kill strangers or persons close to them. You see, I\u0027ve been doing my homework in your field, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that,\" Thurlow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Adele had no insurance,\" Bondelli said. He lowered one finger. \"Next, was the murder carefully planned?\" Another finger came down. \"Psychopaths don\u0027t plan their crimes. Either they leave escape to chance, or they make it ridiculously easy for the police to catch them. Joe practically advertised his presence in that office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow nodded and began to wonder if Bondelli could be right. Am I unconsciously attacking Ruth through her father? Where the hell did she go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Third,\" Bondelli said, \"was a great deal more violence than necessary used in the crime? Deranged people continue an attack beyond all reason. There\u0027s no doubt the first thrust of that sword would\u0027ve killed Adele.\" A third finger came down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow returned his glasses to his nose, stared at Bondelli. The attorney was so intent, so sure of himself. Was it possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fourth,\" Bondelli said, \"was the killing accomplished with an improvised weapon? Persons who plan set themselves up with a lethal weapon beforehand. A psychopath grabs anything at hand --a cleaver, a club, a rock, a piece of furniture.\" The fourth finger came down and Bondelli lowered a fist to the desk. \"That damned sword hung on Joe\u0027s study wall for as long as I can remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all sounds so easy,\" Thurlow said. \"But what\u0027s the prosecution gong to be doing all this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027ll have their experts, naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whelye among them,\" Thurlow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your boss at the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does ... that put you ... on a spot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t bother me, Tony. He\u0027s just another part of the community syndrome. It\u0027s ... it\u0027s the whole mad mess.\" Thurlow looked down at his hands. \"People are going to say Joe\u0027s better off dead --even if he is insane. And the prosecution experts you kiss off with a wave of the hand, they\u0027re going to be saying things the community wants to hear. Everything the judge says is likely to be interpreted ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure we can get an impartial judge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ... no doubt. But judges invariably say the question to be determined is whether at the time of the crime the accused had not the use of that part of his understanding which allowed him to know he was doing a wrong and wicked act. That part, Tony; as though the mind could be divided into compartments, part of it sane, part insane. Impossible! The mind\u0027s a unified thing. A person can\u0027t be mentally and emotionally diseased in some fictitious part without infecting the total personality. A knowledge of right and wrong --the ability to choose between God and the devil --is profoundly different from the knowledge that two plus two equals four. To make the judgment of good and evil requires an intact personality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow looked up, studied Bondelli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attorney was staring out the window, lips pursed in thought. He obviously hadn\u0027t been listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow turned toward the window. He felt sick with frustration and despair, Ruth had run away. That was the only logical, sane, reasonable explanation. Her father was doomed, no matter ... Thurlow\u0027s muscles locked into frozen, glaring suspense. He stared out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome ten feet out, poised in the air, hovering, was an object ... a dome-shaped object with a neat round opening that faced Bondelli\u0027s window. Behind the opening, figures moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow opened his mouth to speak, found he had no voice. He lurched out of his chair, groped his way around the desk away from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy, is something wrong?\" Bondelli asked. The attorney swiveled back, stared up at Thurlow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurlow leaned on the desk facing the window. He looked right into the round opening in the hovering object. There were eyes inside, glowing eyes. A slender tube protruded from the opening. Painful, constricting force pressed in on Thurlow\u0027s chest. He had to fight for each breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God! They\u0027re trying to kill me! he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaves of unconsciousness surged over his mind, receded, returned. His chest was a great gasping region of fire. Dimly, he saw the edge of the desk surge upward past his eyes. Something hit a carpeted floor and he realized with fading consciousness that it was his head. He tried to push himself up, collapsed. \"Andy! Andy! What\u0027s wrong? Andy!\" It was Bondelli\u0027s voice. The voice bounced and receded in a wavering, ringing echo box. \"Andy ... Andy ... And ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondelli stood up -- from a quick examination of Thurlow, shouted for his secretary: \"Mrs. Wilson! Call an ambulance! I think Dr. Thurlow\u0027s had a heart attack.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-heaven-makers/page-13.html","bookId":1572,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:29 PM"}
