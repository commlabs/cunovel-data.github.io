While jogging in a park nearby, she witnesses the shooting of an FBI agent in pursuit of wanted criminals, a couple identified as the Landrys.

A no-nonsense lawman, he\u0027s definitely not the ideal man that Ellie has always imagined, yet she\u0027s attracted to him in a way she can\u0027t explain. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eEllie heads home to Winston Falls, South Carolina, to attend her sister\u0027s wedding. Shortly after she arrives, though, she receives a surprise visitor: Max Daniels. The Landrys have been captured, and she\u0027ll be called to testify. But they\u0027ve been captured before, and each time the witnesses are scared into silence-or disappear before they can take the stand. Max vows to be Ellie\u0027s shadow until the trial, and it isn\u0027t long before sparks fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:29:41 PM"}
