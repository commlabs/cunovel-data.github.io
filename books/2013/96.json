To give in kind is to be in kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now, let me leave here, for ever gone-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she felt that madness reach out to her, an embrace that would sweep away her sense of self, her knowledge of who she had been, once, that proud, smug academic with her pristine intellect ordering and reordering the world. Until even practicality was a quaint notion, not even worthy of discourse, because the world outside wasn’t worth reaching out to, not really-besides, it was sullied, wasn’t it? By men like Tanal Yathvanar and Karos Invictad-the ones who revelled in the filth they made, because only the stench of excess could reach through to their numbed senses-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– as it reaches through to mine. Listen! He returns, step by hesitant step-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA calloused hand settled on her brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanath Anar opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint light, coming from every direction. Warm light, gentle as a breath. Looming above her was a face. Old, lined and weathered, with eyes deep as the seas, even as tears made them glisten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the chain being dragged close. Then the old man tugged with one hand and the links parted like rotted reeds. He reached down, then, and lifted her effortlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbyss, yours is such a gentle face…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness, once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the bed of the river, below silts almost a storey thick, rested the remains of almost sixteen thousand citizens of Letheras. Their bones filled ancient wells that had been drilled before the river’s arrival-before the drainage course from the far eastern mountains changed cataclysmically, making the serpent lash its tail, the torrent carving a new channel, one that inundated a nascent city countless millennia ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetherii engineers centuries past had stumbled upon these submerged constructs, wondering at the humped corridors and the domed chambers, wondering at the huge, deep wells with their clear, cold water. And baffled to explain how such tunnels remained more or less dry, the cut channels seeming to absorb water like runners of sponge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo records existed any more recounting these discoveries-the tunnels and chambers and wells were lost knowledge to all but a chosen few. And of the existence of parallel passages, the hidden doors in the walls of corridors, and the hundreds of lesser tombs, not even those few were aware. Certain secrets belonged exclusively to the gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elder God carried the starved, brutalized woman into one of those side passages, the cantilevered door swinging shut noiselessly behind him. In his mind there was recrimination, a seething torrent of anger at himself. He had not imagined the full extent of depravity and slaughter conducted by the Patriotists, and he was sorely tempted to awaken himself, unleashing his fullest wrath upon these unmitigated sadists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that would lead to unwarranted attention, which would no doubt result in yet greater slaughter, and one that made no distinction between those who deserved death and those who did not. This was the curse of power, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs, he well knew, Karos Invictad would soon discover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou fool, Invigilator. Who has turned his deadly regard upon you? Deadly, oh my, yes indeed., Though few might comprehend that, given the modestly handsome, thoroughly benign features surrounding that face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, Karos Invictad. Tehol Beddict has decided that you must go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I almost pity you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol Beddict was on his knees on the dirt floor of the hovel, rummaging through a small heap of debris, when he heard a scuffling sound at the doorway. He glanced over a shoulder. ‘Ublala Pung, good evening, my friend.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge half-blood Tarthenal edged into the chamber, hunching beneath the low ceiling. ‘What are you doing?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A wooden spoon-or at least the fragment thereof. Employed in a central role in the preparation of this morning’s meal. I dread the possibility that Bugg tossed it into the hearth. Ah! Here, see that? A curdle of fat remains on it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Looks like dirt to me, Tehol Beddict.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, even dirt has flavour,’ he replied, crawling over to the pot simmering on the hearth. ‘Finally, my soup acquires subtle sumptuousness. Can you believe this, Ublala Pung? Look at me, reduced to menial chores, even unto preparing my own meals! I tell you, my manservant’s head has grown too large by far. He rises above his station, does Bugg. Perhaps you could box him about the ears for me. Now, I am not as indifferent as you think-there is the glow of heightened excitement in your rather blunt, dogged features. What has happened? Has Shurq Elalle returned, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Would I be here if she had?’ Ublala asked. ‘No, Tehol Beddict. She is gone. Out to the seas, with all her pirated young men. I was too big, you see. I had to sleep on the deck, no matter the weather, and that was no fun-and those pirates, they kept wanting to tie sails to me, laughing as if that was funny or something.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-96.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
