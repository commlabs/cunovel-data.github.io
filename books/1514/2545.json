Moreover, these black stone pillars were all covered with the names of the people, who have made great contributions to Darkness Palace.

In fact, this place was only opened each time after the worship ceremony begins. Moreover, those who were allowed to come to this place, were all individuals with some standing in the Northern Xuan Region.

Even with such a frightening number of people gathered here, this place was eerily silent. In fact, no one dared to make the slightest noise. Meanwhile, countless pairs of eyes were filled with fear, as they looked at the middle of the square. At that spot, was a black altar and a ten thousand steps stone stairs as well. At the top of the stone stairs was a black throne. Anyone seated there would be able to overlook the entire Darkness Square, and anyone who occupied that seat would seemingly become the overlord of the entire Northern Xuan Region.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, there was a lovely figure seated on the throne above the altar.

In fact, the leaders of eighty percent of the factions in the Northern Xuan Region would personally show up. After which, they would greet the palace master as though they were her subordinates. Moreover, no one dared to miss this event. As such, the experts gathered on this square likely made up sixty percent of the Northern Xuan Region’s fighting strength, and the scale of this event was truly terrifying.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMany respectful cries reverberated across the square. However, that noble figure seated above the altar did not reveal even the slightest emotion in her eyes. Instead, she merely looked around before she focused her attention on the front of Darkness Square. At that area, there were many figures quietly seated there. Most of them were elderly individuals with white hair and the robes that they wore, indicated that they had an extraordinary status within Darkness Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this moment, during such a grand occasion, their eyes were all gently shut.

After which, their eyes paused on the group of elders right at the front. Then, they rotated their eyes and looked around the altar. At that area, were countless black clothed figures and there was a rich bloody smell being emitted from their bodies. Meanwhile, there was also a ferocious ghost face with a black longsword pierced deep into its head, on their black clothes. Hence, they looked extremely terrifying.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEvery faction in the Northern Xuan Region knew about these troops and they were all extremely fearful of them.

It was likely that they had heard some rumours as well. In fact, they knew that the worship ceremony this time around would likely be exceptionally chaotic. However, this had little impact on them. After all, it didn’t matter whether Darkness Palace was in the hands of the current palace master or the Elder Council.
