For my two girls—have fun tonight. Love, Daddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia tears open the box. I swear she’s an animal when it comes to presents. “Daddy sent us corsages!” Nadia screams, sliding hers onto her wrist. It’s a purple orchid, and it goes perfectly with her dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRennie looks over my shoulder as I take mine out of the box and put it onto my wrist. Mine is a pale pink orchid. “That’s so pretty, Lil,” she says in a small voice. I can tell she’s jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn around, I see Nadia opening up my clutch. I lunge at her and scream, “Don’t go into my bag!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia’s mouth drops open. I literally rip it out of her hands and say, “I said, NO LIPSTICK!” My hands are shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia recoils. “Sorr-ee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRennie gives me a funny look. “Ease up, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom takes a picture of Nadia and me with our corsages on, and e-mails them to my dad. Then Nadia’s date comes to take her to her friend’s house. He brings her a corsage too, so now she’s wearing a corsage on each wrist. Of course Mom makes them pose on the stairs together. Nadia threads her arm through her date’s and smiles. In her heels they are the same height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they leave, Ms. Holtz and my mom drive us over to Ashlin’s in my mom’s car. The limo we rented is already there, parked out front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePJ, Reeve, and Alex are standing together awkwardly, passing around PJ’s water bottle with vodka inside. They all have suits on. I think Reeve’s is the same one he wore to junior formal. I can tell because it’s charcoal gray, and because the jacket is tight across his shoulders. PJ has on these weird plastic sunglasses he swears are cool, despite the fact that he bought them for $5.99 at Beachcombers. Alex is the only one who actually looks comfortable in his suit. It’s nice, a black jacket, his tie is gray, and his shoes are freshly shined. Alex goes to a lot of dress-up functions with his family. I know that because his mom’s always trying to invite my mom along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve’s mom is pinning Rennie’s corsage on. It’s a hot pink rose with baby’s breath. Rennie freaked out when Reeve gave it to her. She jumped up and gave him a kiss on the cheek. It’s not like he went to the florist shop and was, like, This rose will match my date’s shoes, or whatever. I’m sure his mom picked it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlin looks beautiful in her dress. It’s short with an empire waist and a swingy skirt of rows of cream-colored silk, and it makes her look really tan. Her hair is twisted and pinned up, a few pieces in tiny braids, and her heels are strappy pale gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s going to make a great homecoming queen. I just hope Reeve doesn’t totally ruin the moment for her. Kat said a couple big drops of the E would do the trick, but maybe I’ll just do one. I don’t want him to throw up on her or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlin’s mom directs us to the front steps of the house. As we line up, I find myself next to Reeve. He looks at me for a quick second and then walks away and stands on the opposite side of the group, slinging his arm over Rennie. Everyone else shifts over to make room for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe take a few pictures like that. Then Rennie calls out, “Couples!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk off the stairs, and she and Reeve cuddle together, his arms around her waist. She throws her head back, laughing at something he whispered into her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Lind jumps out with her camera and says, “Lillia! Go stand next to Alex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn, and Alex blushes. “We’re not going together, Mom,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Lind lifts her camera up to her face. “I know, but the two of you look so cute together. Don’t they, Grace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom nods approvingly. “Send me a copy of that one, Celeste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” she says, gesturing for us to stand next to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex comes up next to me, and we smile for the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little closer,” Mrs. Lind urges. “Put your arm around her, Alex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex sighs and puts his arm around me, saying, “Come on, Mom. We have to leave soon.” He put on cologne. He doesn’t usually wear cologne. It smells nice, though, like lavender and woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Lind starts snapping away. My smile feels like it’s cracking. I wish we were already at the dance, so my part was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKAT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’M STANDING OFF TO THE SIDE, NEAR WHERE THE TABLES and chairs are set up, watching as Lillia ladles punch into two cups over by the drink station. She reaches into her black clutch, touches up her lipstick, and oh so casually tips the vial into one of the cups. It’s so smooth and fast that if I hadn’t been watching her like a hawk, I wouldn’t have seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia walks back over to her table, pretending to look for Rennie, who is in the bathroom. “Where’s your girl?” she asks Reeve, who is sitting alone. “She asked me to get her some punch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve looks taken aback. “Rennie’s not my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s not what she thinks. You really shouldn’t lead people on like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re one to talk.” I can tell Reeve’s checking Lillia out by the way he keeps looking away and then quickly looking back. “Rennie’s my bro. That’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex and PJ are your bros. Do you make out with them, too?” She’s still holding on to both of the cups, her clutch tucked underneath her arm. The plan was for Lillia to just offer him the punch. I don’t know why she’s still talking to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were playing spin the bottle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t talking about spin the bottle. Or that night at Bow Tie. I was talking about last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you care so much?” he asks with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s my best friend,” Lillia says automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish she would look over at me so I could signal to her to wrap this up already. This exchange is going on so long, I’m starting to wonder—is she going to chicken out? I hate to admit it, but maybe part of me would be relieved. Just the tiniest bit. I’ve known Reeve as long as anybody else. Everyone on Jar Island knows how bad he wants a football scholarship. How bad he wants off this island. As much as I do, even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find myself holding my breath as I wait to see what Lillia will do. Across the room I see Mary come in through the doors. She looks beautiful in a long pink dress, her blond hair down in waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Lillia sees Mary at the same time I do, because she finally holds out the cup to Reeve and says, “Cheers. Good luck with homecoming king.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burn-for-burn-burn-for-burn-1/page-54.html","bookId":2726,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:24 PM"}
