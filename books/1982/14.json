What do you want it for?” Suspicions multiplied in his brain. Being a newspaper reporter, Paul was used to getting information out of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get all bent out of shape, little brother. Leah and I want to go to a movie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, we’d like Carrie to babysit. She was a real hit with the boys yesterday. You don’t mind, do you? The girl’s a natural with kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I don’t mind.” The fact was, Jason felt downright pleased. If Paul and Leah wanted Carrie to babysit, then Charlotte would be at home alone. He could come up with an excuse—Higgins would do—and casually drop in on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed to talk, and the sooner the better, although it wasn’t talking that interested him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed what remained of his popcorn in the garbage, brushed his teeth and shaved. He even slapped on some cologne. He wasn’t accustomed to using anything more than aftershave, but this evening was an exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was whistling when he’d finished, his spirits high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the pretense of asking about next Saturday’s ball game, he phoned his brother to be certain Paul had managed to get hold of Carrie. He had. In fact, he’d be picking her up in the next half hour. Allowing ten minutes for Paul to whisk Carrie out of the apartment, that left him with forty minutes to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty minutes would go fast, Jason mused, as he sat back down and turned on the TV. But his mind wasn’t on the bowling match. A far more intriguing match was playing in his mind. One between Charlotte and him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight was the night, he decided, determined to take Charlotte beyond the kissing stage. He didn’t mean to be calculating and devious about it…Well, yes, he did, Jason thought with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d be gentle with her, he promised himself. Patient and reassuring. For years he’d been treating terrified animals. One stubborn woman shouldn’t be any more difficult. He had no intention of pressuring her into anything. Nor would he coerce her if she was at all uncomfortable. He’d lead into lovemaking naturally, spontaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch, eager now, and was disappointed to see that only ten minutes had passed. Half an hour wasn’t really very long, but it seemed to feel that way to Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m leaving now, Mom,” Carrie called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte walked out of the kitchen, drying her hands on a terry-cloth towel. She smiled at Paul, then looked at her daughter. “Do you know what time you’ll be home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before ten. Don’t worry, I know it’s a school night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll have her back closer to nine,” Paul assured Charlotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” She nodded. “Have fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will,” Carrie said as they left, offering her first smile of the day. Actually, Charlotte had been talking to Paul, but she let it pass. Carrie was still upset about the school dance and had been cool toward Charlotte all afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte had just settled down with a book when there was a knock at the door. Please, God, don’t let it be Jason, she prayed, but apparently God was occupied elsewhere. Just as she’d feared, she opened the door and came face-to-face with Jason, boyishly handsome in his baseball cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” he said, charming her with his smile. It wasn’t fair that a man should be able to wreak such havoc on a woman’s heart with a mere movement of the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello.” She’d been dreading this moment all day. “I was going to phone you later.” A slight exaggeration; she’d been planning to delay calling for as long as possible. “Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes…I won’t be able to go to the ball game with you next Saturday after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about it,” he said, making himself comfortable on her sofa. He anchored his ankle on the opposite knee and grinned up at her. “There’ll be plenty of other Saturdays. The summer is filled with Saturdays.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was awkward for her to be standing, while he seemed completely at home. So Charlotte sat, too—as far away from him as she could while still being on the same sofa. She angled her legs sideways, her hands clasped. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to make it any other Saturday, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause followed her announcement. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I…” She couldn’t look at him. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to see each other anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.” He didn’t reveal his reactions one way or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotion seemed to thicken the air. He might not be saying anything, but he was feeling it. Charlotte was, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it something I said?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her eyes farther and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something I did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…Oh, please, Jason, just accept this. Don’t make it any more difficult than it already is.” Her voice, which had remained steady until then, cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Charlotte,” Jason said, moving next to her with startling agility. “For heaven’s sake, what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covered her mouth with one hand and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not leaving until you tell me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because!” she cried, leaping to her feet. “Everything would’ve been all right if you hadn’t been so…so nice.” She was angry now, unreasonably angry, and not quite sure why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason stood, too, his gaze holding hers. “I’m not sorry I kissed you. Nothing would make me regret that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words made it all so difficult. She wasn’t sorry, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression must have told him as much. He relaxed visibly and reached for her, gently holding her shoulders. Slowly, he drew her forward. Charlotte had no resistance left, and walked right into his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobbed once, then hid her face in his chest and wept openly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason stroked her hair and whispered reassurances in her ear, as if she were a small child needing comforting. In some ways, she was exactly that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several minutes he lifted her face upward to meet his mouth. Over and over again he kissed her, lightly, softly, gently. Her breathing grew shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” He raised his head, his eyes meeting hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re doing it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth curved into a deliberate smile. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were against his chest when he sought her mouth again. He was still gentle, but the kisses changed in texture and intensity. Their lips were fused together, the heat between them burning so fierce, she thought it might scorch her. Charlotte found it difficult to breathe, but she didn’t care. Breathing wasn’t important. She held on, her hands clutching his upper arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason led her back to the sofa, and without protest, Charlotte followed. He sat down and brought her into his lap. He didn’t give her the opportunity to protest before he directed her lips back to his. When her mouth opened in exultant welcome, he moaned. He kissed her again and again, until she was panting. Until her heart seemed to stop beating. Until there was nothing in her world but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were opening the front of her blouse even before she realized his intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason, no,” she said in a panic. “Please, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” Jason twisted around and turned off the light. The room dimmed and shadows danced across the walls. “Is this better?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte clamped her eyes shut. “I…I’m not very good at this,” she whispered, close to tears. “I’m not…sexy enough.” The only thing that kept her from springing free of his hold was fear. It held her immobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re beautiful,” he whispered. “Charlotte, do you hear me? You’re perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buried her hands in his hair. His cap was gone, but she didn’t remember when he’d removed it. Or if he had. She sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again, his mouth hard and hungry. Charlotte understood his hunger, but she wasn’t capable of satisfying it. “No,” she whispered when she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No?” How disappointed he sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure of that?” he asked, sounding regretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, kissed her once more, then inhaled sharply. “I just wanted to check.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told you that you aren’t sexy?” Jason asked, relaxing on her sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte’s hands stilled as she poured coffee into two mugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you expect a man to get excited when his wife’s such a cold fish? No wonder you’re a failure at lovemaking. Are you sure you’re even a woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte’s heart reeled as Tom’s words returned to haunt her. She’d laid to rest as much of his vindictiveness as she could, bound her wounds and gone on with her life. Pulling away the bandage, examining the damage now, just seemed pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Charlotte?” he probed gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My ex-husband,” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s wrong, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, rather than argue with Jason. For the moment he was infatuated with her, but his fascination wouldn’t last, and eventually he’d feel the same way as Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never mention your ex-husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s not much to say.” She carried the two mugs into the living room. “Carrie was excited about babysitting Paul and Leah’s children,” she said, pointedly changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason stood and took a cup from her hands, then sat next to her on the sofa, sliding his arm around her shoulders. His touch was warm against her chilled skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re perfect,” he whispered and kissed her cheek. “You’re lovely and sensuous and beautiful. Don’t ever let anyone tell you differently. I’m not going to force you to discuss your marriage. Not now, but I want you to know I’ll be ready to listen whenever you’re ready to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled wanly, determined to steer the conversation away from the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason drank his coffee and left soon afterward, when it was apparent Charlotte wasn’t in the mood to talk. She wasn’t sure what her mood was, but she lacked the strength to analyze it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore leaving, Jason asked if she’d changed her mind again about the ball game on Saturday, and after a short hesitation, she nodded. Yes, she’d go, she told him. Jason smiled, obviously pleased, and headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was happening to her, Charlotte thought, trembling. And it was happening against her will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d made the decision earlier—she wasn’t going to see him again. After careful deliberation she’d decided it was best to end everything now before one or both of them ended up hurt. It was a simple, cut-and-dried conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet…yet when she’d tried to talk to him about it, regret and doubt had consumed her until she’d dissolved in tears and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven help her, she didn’t want it to end! Jason must’ve sensed that because he hadn’t appeared too concerned when she’d told him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-14.html","bookId":1982,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM"}
