Meanwhile, the book version of the prints, with extensive commentary, has been published this month as The Great British (New York Graphic Society, Boston, $14.95). The photographs, like those found in Newman\u0027s three previous books and in his hundreds of assignments for Life, Look, Newsweek and other publications, are far more than mere portraits. Rather, they are profound artistic statements, in which the background of the picture often symbolizes the person\u0027s achievement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t use props: I use reality,\" explains Newman, taking a break at the West 57th Street studio he has occupied since 1948. On the wall are pictures — he prefers that word to \"photographs\" — of Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Eugene O\u0027Neill and four American presidents; Newman has photographed every president since Truman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Big, burly, mellow-voiced and casually dressed, Arnold Newman at 61 looks like an aging beatnik. His quick wit and ready laugh mask a perfectionism that has characterized his work ever since he turned to photography in 1938. His ability \"to make the camera see what I saw\" showed itself almost at once. In 1941 he held his first exhibition and sold his first print to the Museum of Modern Art.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I could have made, over the years, a hell of a lot more money than I have, simply by doing more commercial work and cashing in on my reputation. But that doesn\u0027t interest me,\" he reflects, puffing on his ever present cigar. \"I mean, money interests me, but I\u0027d just see my life being wasted.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Specializing in portraits of artists, he studies the work of each subject intensely beforehand so that the essence of the artist will be distilled into the photograph, by subconscious as well as conscious effort. On the side, he does enough commercial work to support his own artistic efforts. But over the years, the two have somehow merged: \"I\u0027m forever being commissioned for things I\u0027d give my eye teeth to do, and paid very well for it. Recently I went out to do a photograph strictly on my own of somebody I admired, and I hate the picture. Yet the day before I did a picture for money which I think is one of my best pictures in the last three years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In 1953, he went to Washington to photograph 15 U.S. senators for Holiday magazine, including John F. Kennedy — then a political unknown who was sometimes labeled the Playboy senator. \"Years later,\" recalls Newman, \"I was photographing President Kennedy on the White House lawn. He turned to me and said, \u0027Arnold, whatever happened to that first picture you took of me?\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I said, \u0027Well, Mr. President, we did 15 senators, and they found out they had one too many for the layout, so they dropped the one least likely to succeed.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you have to understand: we were surrounded by secret servicemen, and Pierre Salinger, his press secretary, was there. Well I thought I\u0027d get a big yack, because Kennedy had a marvelous sense of humor. But instead, his face went rigid. And I — I absolutely turned ice cold. The Secret Service men turned around and gave me a \u0027How stupid can you be?\u0027 look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A bit later I managed to get into Pierre\u0027s office and started stammering and apologizing. Suddenly Pierre started breaking out in laughter. I said, \u0027What the hell\u0027s so funny?\u0027 He said, \u0027He was pulling your leg! He\u0027s been walking all around the White House for the last 30 minutes, telling that story on himself.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After the assassination, Newman was called to the White House again to photograph the official portrait of Lyndon Johnson. \"He could give an angel an ulcer. … I didn\u0027t get paid for the picture, not even my expenses. It cost me a fortune.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arnold and his wife Augusta have been married for 31 years; she runs the studio and works closely with him. Their two sons, Eric and David, are professionals in neurology and architecture, respectively. The Newmans\u0027 favorite neighborhood restaurants include Rikyu and Genghiz Khan\u0027s Bicycle on Columbus Avenue, and the Cafe des Artistes on their own block.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Asked whether he eventually plans to pursue other areas of photography besides portraits, Newman shakes his head. \"The whole history of painting was changed by a man who used the same materials as everybody else did — the same brushes, paints, canvas, and subject matter,\" he explains. \"So why do we say that Cezanne revolutionized painting? It\u0027s his ideas. I deal with ideas too.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44987.html","bookId":46,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:59:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:59:34 AM"}
