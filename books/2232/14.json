He could not worry about the two unconscious men. Right now, he needed to get to Stephanie, her surly attitude be damned. Clearly, the man from the cathedral, the one who\u0027d killed Peter Hansen, had his own problems. Somebody had taken out his two accomplices. Malone had no idea who or why, but he was grateful, since escaping from that crypt could have proven tough. He cursed himself again for getting involved, but it was too late to walk away now. He was in--whether he liked it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a roundabout path out of the Stroget and eventually made his way to Kongens Nytorv, a typically busy city square encircled by stately buildings. His senses were on maximum alert and he kept a sharp lookout for any tails, but no one was behind him. At this late hour, traffic in the square was light. Nyhavn, just beyond the square\u0027s east side, with its colorful harbor promenade of gabled houses, continued to accommodate waterfront diners at outdoor tables lively with music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hustled down the sidewalk toward the Hotel d\u0027Angleterre. The brightly lit seven-story structure faced the sea and stretched an entire city block. The elegant building dated from the eighteenth century, its rooms, he knew, having hosted kings, emperors, and presidents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the lobby and passed the desk. A soft melody drifted from the main lounge. A few late-night patrons milled about. A row of house phones dotted a marble counter and he used one to call Stephanie Nelle\u0027s room. The phone rang three times before it was answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wake up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t listen well, do you, Cotton?\" The voice still carried the same desultory tone from Roskilde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter Hansen is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment of silence passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in six ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE STEPPED INTO THE ROOM. STEPHANIE WORE ONE OF THE HOTEL\u0027S signature robes. He told her everything that had just happened. She listened in silence, just like in years past when he\u0027d made reports. But he saw a sense of defeat in her tired features, one he hoped signaled a change in attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to let me help you now?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied him through eyes that, he\u0027d often noticed, changed shades as her mood shifted. In some ways she reminded him of his mother, though Stephanie was only a dozen or so years older than him. Her anger from earlier was not out of character. She didn\u0027t like making mistakes and she hated having them pointed out. Her talent was not in gathering information but in analyzing and assessing--a meticulous organizer who plotted and planned with the cunning of a leopard. He\u0027d watched her many times make tough decisions without hesitation--both attorneys general and presidents had relied on her cool head--so he wondered about her present quandary and its strange effect on her usually sound judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pointed them to Hansen,\" she muttered. \"In the cathedral, I didn\u0027t correct him when he implied Hansen may have Lars\u0027s journal.\" She told him about the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe him.\" When she did he said, \"That\u0027s the same guy who started the shooting and the one who shot Hansen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The jumper from the Round Tower worked for him. He came to steal my bag, which contained Lars\u0027s journal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he goes to the same auction, knowing you\u0027d be there. Who knew you were going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Hansen. The office knows only that I\u0027m on vacation. I have my world phone, but I left word not to be disturbed unless it was a catastrophic emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you learn about the auction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three weeks ago a package arrived postmarked from Avignon, France. Inside was a note and Lars\u0027s journal.\" She paused. \"I hadn\u0027t seen that notebook in years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew this would ordinarily be a forbidden subject. Lars Nelle had taken his own life eleven years ago, found hanging from a bridge in southern France, a note in his pocket that merely said GOODBYE STEPHANIE. For an academician who\u0027d penned a multitude of books, such a simple salutation seemed almost an insult. Though she and her husband were separated at the time, Stephanie took the loss hard, and Malone recalled how difficult the months after had been. Never had they spoken about his death, and for her to even mention it now was extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Journal of what?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lars was fascinated with the secrets of Rennes-le-Chateau--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I read his books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never mentioned that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to sense his irritation. A lot was happening and neither one of them had time for chitchat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lars made a living expounding theories on what may or may not be hidden in and around Rennes-le-Chateau,\" she said. \"But he kept many of his private thoughts in the journal, which stayed with him always. After he died, I thought Mark had it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bad subject. Mark Nelle had been an Oxford-educated medieval historian who taught at the University of Toulouse, in southern France. Five years ago he was lost in the Pyrenees. An avalanche. His body never found. Malone knew that tragedy had been accentuated by the fact that Stephanie and her son had not been close. A lot of bad blood flowed in the Nelle family, none of which was any of his business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That damn journal was like a ghost come back to haunt me,\" she said. \"There it was. Lars\u0027s handwriting. The note told me about the auction and the availability of the book. I remembered Lars speaking of it, and there were references in the journal, so I came to buy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And danger bells weren\u0027t clanging in your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? My husband was not involved in my line of work. His was a harmless quest for things that don\u0027t exist. How was I to know there were people involved who would kill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man leaping from the Round Tower was clear enough. You should have come to me then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to do this alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Cotton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that book so important? I learned at the auction that it\u0027s a nondescript account of no importance. They were shocked it sold for so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\" Exasperation returned to her tone. \"Truly, I don\u0027t. Two weeks ago I sat down, read Lars\u0027s notebook, and I have to say I became fascinated. I\u0027m ashamed to say I never read one of his books until last week. When I did, I began to feel awful about my attitude toward him. Eleven years can add a lot of perspective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did you plan to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know. Just buy the book. Read it and see what happened from there. While I was over here, I planned to go to France and spend a few days at Lars\u0027s house. I haven\u0027t been there in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe apparently was trying to make peace with demons, but there was reality to consider. \"You need help, Stephanie. There\u0027s more happening here, and this is something I do have experience handling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have a bookshop to run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My employees can handle things for a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, seemingly considering his offer. \"You were the best I ever had. I\u0027m still mad you quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had to do what I had to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"To have Henrik Thorvaldsen steal you away. Insult to injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, when he\u0027d retired and told her he planned to move to Copenhagen, she\u0027d been happy for him, until learning about Thorvaldsen\u0027s involvement. Characteristically, she\u0027d never explained herself and he knew better than to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some more bad news for you,\" he said. \"The person who outbid you for the book? On the phone? It was Henrik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast him a look of disdain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was working with Peter Hansen,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What led you to that conclusion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told her what he learned at the auction and what the man had said to him over the radio. I detest those who deceive me. \"Apparently Hansen was playing both ends against the middle and the middle won.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait outside,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I came. You and Henrik need to talk. But we need to leave here with caution. Those men may still be out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get dressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved toward the door. \"Where\u0027s Lars\u0027s journal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed to the safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that wise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police are going to find Hansen\u0027s body. It won\u0027t take them long to connect the dots. We need to be ready to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced her. \"Washington bailed you out of Roskilde because they don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing. Right now, I\u0027m sure someone in Justice is trying to find out. You hate questions, and you can\u0027t tell the attorney general to go to hell when he calls. I\u0027m still not sure what you\u0027re doing, but I know one thing, you don\u0027t want to talk about it. So pack up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t miss that arrogance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your ray-of-sunshine personality has left my life incomplete, too. Could you just for once do what I ask? It\u0027s tough enough in the field without acting stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need to be reminded of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-14.html","bookId":2232,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM"}
