She lights a cigarette. I light one too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was probably watching us,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So act natural,\" she says. \"You don\u0027t know me anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know you,\" I tell her. \"Can we see each other tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to be too busy basking in the glow of your success?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but I want to share it with you,\" I say. \"Lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" she says, taking another drag. \"I have a luncheon at Chanel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want, Lauren?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Some yuppie guy to take you out to Le Cirque every night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s better?\" she asks back. \"Unable to pay your rent and depressed and trembling in the local Kentucky Fried Chicken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh please. That\u0027s the only alternative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d marry him if you could, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien\u0027s totally not my type, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably not true,\" she says softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want him to give you-what? Things? You want to discover the true meaning of suburban life? You think that goombah\u0027s even in the Social Register?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien is in the Social Register.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah, right, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a time, Victor, when I wanted you,\" she says, taking a drag on the cigarette. \"There was actually a moment, Victor, when all I ever wanted was you.\" Pause. \"I find it hard to believe myself, but well, there it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, you\u0027re cool,\" I say very softly. \"Please-you\u0027re very cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh stop it, Victor,\" she says. \"You\u0027re so full of shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You\u0027re still not into me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a commitment, Victor,\" she says. \"You\u0027re the last person on earth I\u0027d ever ask for one from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you\u0027re gonna get it from Damien Nutchs Ross? Spare me, baby. Just spare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finishes the cigarette and starts to move slowly up Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been doing it with Alison Poole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, watch it.\" Almost instinctively I look for Duke or Digby, but they\u0027re not around. \"Why do you think that shit\u0027s true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it is: how do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god, Victor, who doesn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only two books she owns are the Bible and The Andy Warhol Diaries, and the Bible was a gift,\" Lauren mutters. \"Queen of the f**king pig people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027m not following.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t sound like you, Victor.\" She smiles at me and then says, \"It\u0027s nice to have someone responsible around-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean loaded. You mean rich. You mean moola.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You don\u0027t like me because maybe I\u0027m hustling a little? You don\u0027t like me because I\u0027m like affected by the recession?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" she says, \"if only you cared this much when you first met me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean in, kiss her on the mouth hard, and I\u0027m surprised that she lets me and after I pull away she presses her face up into mine, wanting the kiss to continue, her hand clutching mine, her fingers grasping my fingers. Finally I break it off and mumble that I\u0027ve got to get uptown and in a very casual, hip way, without even really trying, I hop on the Vespa, kick it into gear and speed up Park without looking back, though if I had been I would\u0027ve seen Lauren yawning while she waved for a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black Jeep, its top up, its windows tinted, wheels in behind me on 23rd Street and as I zoom through the Park Avenue tunnel whoever\u0027s driving flips on his brights and closes in, the Jeep\u0027s fender grazing the back of the Vespa\u0027s wheel guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swerve onto the dividing line, oncoming traffic racing toward me while I bypass the row of cabs on my side, heading toward the wraparound at Grand Central. I accelerate up the ramp, zoom around the curve, swerving to miss a limo idling in front of the Grand Hyatt, and then I\u0027m back on Park without any hassles until I hit 48th Street, where I look over my shoulder and spot the Jeep a block behind me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-56.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
