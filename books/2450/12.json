{"id":80117,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eOn my way home, I choose to tell Dad about what happened with Tyler, Nancy and Mrs. Reed, figuring it\u0027s better that he hear about it from me rather than someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, Dad is already there when I arrive. He must have clocked off early. He\u0027s in the kitchen, talking with someone. No sign of Mum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad often has people over to the flat. As Mrs. Reed noted, he\u0027s heavily involved with local movements to stem the tide of immigration and keep Britain white. He does a lot of canvassing for politicians, works hard behind the scenes, helps stir things up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve always tried to stay out of that area of his life, but it\u0027s getting harder. Now that I\u0027m older, he\u0027s started taking me to meetings. I\u0027ve been to a few rallies with him too, and once he took me to a house packed with Muslims. I stood outside while he went in and had a long conversation with them. Well, it was more of a screaming match. I could hear them from outside, the Muslims shrieking, Dad shouting even louder. I felt small and afraid, no idea what was going on or what would happen next, standing in the middle of the street like a lemon, wondering what I should do if Dad never reappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did emerge in the end, and I saw a Muslim guy glowering behind him. Dad pointed to me and said, \"That\u0027s who I fight for - my kid, my wife, my friends. Anything ever happens to any of them, I\u0027ll come back here and burn the lot of you down to the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Dad hugged me hard. I glared at the Muslim and shot him the finger. Dad laughed, clapped my back, took me for dinner and bought me the biggest hamburger I\u0027d ever seen. I felt bad about it afterwards but at the time I was on cloud nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me knows I should stop acting, that I\u0027m on thin ice, growing less sure of where the actor ends and the real me begins. When I grunted at Nancy, that wasn\u0027t part of an act. That came from the soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should tell Dad I don\u0027t share his views, that I\u0027m not warped inside like he is, start standing up to him. But how can you say such a thing to your father? He loves me, I know he does, despite the beatings when he\u0027s angry. It would break his heart if I told him what I really thought of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad doesn\u0027t like to be disturbed when he\u0027s discussing the state of affairs with his friends and associates, so even though I\u0027m hungry, I slide on by the kitchen, planning to head straight to my room. But Dad must hear me because he calls out, \"B? Is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds more subdued than usual. That tips me off to the fact that there might be somebody important with him. Dad\u0027s loud and bullish most of the time, but quiet and submissive around people he respects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head into the kitchen, expecting someone in a suit with a politically perfect smile. But I stagger to a halt halfway through the door and stare uncertainly. The guy with Dad is like nobody I\u0027ve ever seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man is standing by the table, sipping from a cup of coffee. He sets it down when he spots me and arches an eyebrow, amused by my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s very tall, maybe six foot six, and thin, except for a large potbelly. It looks weird on such a slender frame, and the buttons on the pink shirt he\u0027s wearing beneath his striped jacket strain to hold it in. He has a mop of white hair and pale skin. Not albino pale, but damn close. Long, creepy-looking fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s his eyes that prove so startling. They\u0027re by far the biggest I\u0027ve ever seen, at least twice the size of mine. Almost totally white, except for a dark, tiny pupil at the center of each. As soon as I see him, I immediately think, Owl Man. I almost say it out loud, but catch myself in time. Dad would hit the roof if I insulted one of his guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this is the infamous B Smith,\" the man chuckles. He has a smooth, cultured voice. He sounds like a radio presenter, but one of the old guys you hear on a Sunday afternoon on the station your gran listens to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Dad says. He runs a hand over my head and smiles as if he\u0027s in pain and trying to hide it. \"How was school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I mutter, unable to tear my gaze away from Owl Man\u0027s enormous, cartoonish eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some people think it\u0027s rude to stare,\" Owl Man says merrily, \"but I\u0027ve always considered it a sign of honest curiosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I say, blushing at the polite rebuke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to be,\" Owl Man laughs. \"The young should be curious, and open too. You should have nothing to hide or apologize for at your tender age. Leave that to decrepit old warhorses like your father and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad clears his throat and looks questioningly at Owl Man. \"Anything you\u0027d like to ask?\" he says meekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just now,\" Owl Man purrs and waves a long, bony hand at me. \"You may proceed. It has been nice seeing you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\" I frown, certain I\u0027ve never met this guy before. There\u0027s no way I could have forgotten eyes like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you when you were a child. You were a cute little thing. Sweet enough to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwl Man gnashes his teeth playfully, but there\u0027s nothing funny about the way he does it and I get goose bumps up my arms and the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to my room,\" I tell Dad and hurry out without saying anything else. I half expect Dad to call me back and bark at me for not saying a proper good-bye, but he lets me go without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find it hard to settle. I keep thinking about the guy in the kitchen, those unnaturally large eyes. Who the hell is he? He doesn\u0027t look like anyone else my dad has ever invited round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI surf the Web for a while, then stick on my headphones and listen to my iPod. I shut my eyes and bop my head to the music, trying to lose myself in the tunes. Sometime later, opening my eyes to stare at the ceiling, I spot Owl Man standing just inside the door to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody hell!\" I shout, ripping off the headphones and sitting up quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did knock,\" Owl Man says, \"but there was no answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been standing there?\" I yell, trying to remember if I\u0027d been scratching myself inappropriately over the last five or ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mere moments,\" he says, his smile never slipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s my dad?\" I ask, heart beating hard. For a crazy second I think that the stranger has killed Dad, maybe pecked him to death, and is now gearing up for an attack on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the kitchen,\" Owl Man says. \"I had to come up to use the facilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe falls silent and stares at me with his big, round eyes. At the back of my mind I hear Mum reading that old fairy tale to me when I was younger. All the better to see you with, my dear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" I snap, not caring about insulting him now, angry at him for invading my privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to ask you a question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah?\" I squint, wondering if he\u0027s going to make a pass at me, ready to scream for Dad if he does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still have the dream?\" he asks, and the scream dies silently on my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What dream?\" I croak, but I know the one he means, and he knows that I know. I can see it in his freakish, unsettling eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dream about the babies,\" Owl Man says softly. \"Your father told me that you had it all the time when you were younger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hell would he tell you something like that?\" I try to snap, but it comes out more as a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m interested in dreams,\" Owl Man beams. \"Especially dreams of monstrous babies. mummy,\" he adds in a high-pitched voice, and it sounds just the way the babies in my nightmare say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my room,\" I moan. \"Get out before I call my dad and tell him you tried to molest me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father knows I would never do anything like that,\" Owl Man sniffs and takes a step closer. \"I\u0027m not leaving until you tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I spit. \"I don\u0027t have it anymore, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwl Man studies me silently. Then his lips lift into an even wider, sickening smile. \"You\u0027re lying. You do still have the dream. How interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall, thin man pats his potbelly, then presses his fingers to his lips and blows me a kiss. \"Good evening, B. It has been a pleasure meeting you again after all these years. Take care of yourself. There are dark times ahead of us. But I think you will fare well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that he turns and slips out of my room, carefully closing the door behind him. I don\u0027t put my headphones back on. I can\u0027t move. I just lie on my bed, think about his enormous eyes, wonder at the nature of his questions and shiver. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-12.html","bookId":2450,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM"}
