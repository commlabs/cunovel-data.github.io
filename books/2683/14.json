The bar is mobbed, white boys with dreadlocks, black girls wearing Nirvana T-shirts, grungy homeboys, gym queens with buzz cuts, mohair, neon, Janice Dickerson, bodyguards and their models from the shows today looking hot but exhausted, fleece and neoprene and pigtails and silicone and Brent Fraser as well as Brendan Fraser and pom-poms and chenille sleeves and falconer gloves and everyone\u0027s smoochy. I wave over at Pell and Vivien, who are drinking Cosmopolitans with Marcus-who\u0027s wearing an English barrister\u0027s wig-and this really cool lesbian, Egg, who\u0027s wearing an Imperial margarine crown, and she\u0027s sitting next to two people dressed like two of the Banana Splits, which two I couldn\u0027t possibly tell.
