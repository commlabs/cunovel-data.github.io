Zheng heard the sound then said to everyone. \"Hurry, the way out is opened. O\u0027Connell, go carry your wife!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng headed through the hole and saw a new path on the side. He entered it without hesitation then suddenly felt pain on his left shoulder. The whole arm turned numbed instantly. That was when he noticed a large scorpion in the tunnel. Its tail stung his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shit!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no time for him to take the axe from his left hand. The movie characters and the water were coming from behind so he couldn\u0027t back either. He channeled all his qi and blood energy to bring up the fusion flame, then jumped at the scorpion. The scorpion bit his shoulder but at the same time it was consumed by his flame. Its exoskeleton cracked and shattered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The others had just entered the path at this time. As soon as they saw the body of the scorpion, the water flooded in and carried them deep into the path. To their despair, what was in front of them was a wall, and the group fell into a silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng knew that behind this wall was the lobby where they first entered the tomb. In the original movie, it was Evelyn\u0027s son who knocked down a pillar by accident and broke open this wall. However, Evelyn\u0027s son wasn\u0027t even born at this time. He had to think of another way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng brought out the Spear of Osiris again without much thinking. He had used up a large amount of blood energy and qi already, but he had no other choice. As they were getting closer to the wall, he clenched his teeth and began channeling the energies into the spear. Zheng was finally able to throw the spear when there were ten meters left to the wall. A golden light flashed across and opened up a two meter wide hole. The group was pushed out through the hole by the water and landed on the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Water kept coming through the hole for a while then stopped. It seemed like the floodgate closed itself. They lay on the ground without moving a finger. No one bothered to check what was around since they were exhausted. This feeling of escaping from the edge of hell was more intense than hitting the lottery ten times.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ardeth also lay on the ground quietly until he smashed a scorpion passing by. He noticed Zheng\u0027s arm was swollen and turned black. Zheng was struggling to take out the dimensional bag with his right arm. Ardeth immediately ran over to him and took the bag out. Zheng fetched a syringe from the bag then stabbed it on his arm. He finally let out a sigh of relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That was shitty luck. I got ambushed by a scorpion as soon as I entered the path. Luckily, I brought antidotes with me.\" Zheng muttered. The swell on his arm was subsiding, black colored blood oozed out from where he was stung. Ardeth stabbed his shoulder a few more times with a knife to let the black blood come out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After bleeding out a pool of black blood on the ground, Zheng\u0027s arm returned to normal size. Though it still looked red, like being burned with boiling water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The venom was strong. Fortunately, it was me who got stung. And it still required an antidote with my physical stats.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The others also sat up by this time. Jonathan said. \"This adventure wasn\u0027t interesting. I didn\u0027t get anything aside from water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng laughed. \"Who said so? The Bracelet of Anubis is good stuff. You might not understand this but if we obtained the Scorpion King\u0027s treasure, you can find an enormous diamond inside. The diamond will be worth more than any gold. Haha.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonathan said excitedly. \"Diamond? How big is it? As big as a pigeon\u0027s egg? No, that seems a little too big. Is it bigger than a pinky?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng drew a circle with his hands. \"The size of a soccer ball, maybe a little bigger. Haha, that\u0027s the only diamond of its size in the world!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonathan replied without any excitement. \"Are you toying with me? There can\u0027t be a diamond so big in the world, only in legends.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng smiled. \"I am sorry but the Scorpion King is a legend. Let\u0027s get back to the dirigible. Or do you like this place so much?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Connell picked out Evelyn and laughed. \"You finally see how horrifying adventures are? After we get back, you will wait by Hamunaptra for us to return. Understand?\" He followed Zheng out the tomb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Evelyn smiled. \"I have you here. I don\u0027t want to stay alone and worry about your safety. We came out safely even when it was so dangerous this time, so as long as we be careful, we will be fine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng smiled bitterly as he heard their conversation. To be honest, he couldn\u0027t guarantee any safety in searching for the Scorpion King. If God suddenly decides to give him one or two surprises, especially with the difficulty raised to the highest for entering plots in advance, could he search for the treasure by himself?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When he thought about it, obtaining the bracelet had already been so difficult. What about completing the whole plot of The Mummy Returns? Especially at its highest difficulty? There was no comrade he could rely on. The movie characters might be stronger than normal people but they were still on the same level as newbies. He didn’t have the confidence to challenge the Scorpion King with this team. However, if he doesn\u0027t do it, there would only be sixty days left in his life. Once he began the search for the bracelet, there was no turning back. So this was what the clone experienced? No wonder he became so strong.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After they returned to the dirigible, Zheng said in a serious tone. \"Everyone, I will go search for the Scorpion King alone. It\u0027s too dangerous. I can\u0027t put you in such risks. You can see from this adventure that I will make every little problem around me into life and death situations. I am much stronger than you. If I died, the you won\u0027t be able to make it back alive.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ardeth said. \"No. Even if it isn\u0027t for you, I have to go along. Because if you failed, I have to come back and let my tribe know. Then we will take on the responsibility of killing the Scorpion King. It\u0027s difficult but I have to come along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng looked at Ardeth thankfully. He understood it was true but Ardeth didn\u0027t have to do these things himself. He was the leader of the tribe so he could send someone else to do it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonathan hesitated. \"F*ck. I have to see that diamond the size of two soccer balls with my eyes. There\u0027s no regret even if I die after seeing it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sorry but I said it\u0027s the size of one soccer ball.\" Zheng felt moved by his words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Connell also nodded. \"I promised to help you, so don\u0027t worry. We will go search for the Scorpion King\u0027s treasure, and come back alive!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Connell stared at Evelyn intensely. She thought for a bit then said. \"How about this. I won\u0027t go into the pyramid, but at least let me take a look. I will wait on the dirigible. Please, let me go take a look.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seeing O\u0027Connell was wavering, Zheng and Jonathan shook their heads.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-11-chapter-4-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-11-chapter-5-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-11-chapter-4-03","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
