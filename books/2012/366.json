I gave that sword back!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to one side, Sag’Churok suddenly clashed his massive swords, and both men looked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler snorted. ‘Think he just told us to shut up, Stormy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were fast closing on the hill with its grey, silent mass of undead warriors. That hill – that’s a cemetery. Well, where else would they be? Gesler saw one warrior setting off down the lumpy hillside, dragging its stone sword as a child would an oversized branch. ‘That one,’ he said. ‘Wants to talk to us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Better than rising up under our feet and cutting us to pieces.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, much better. What do you think, Stormy? We got ourselves unexpected allies?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pity the Assail if we have.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler spat. ‘This ain’t the day for pity. Sag’Churok! Don’t do anything stupid like attacking it, all right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slowed to a walk thirty paces from the lone T’lan Imass. At fifteen the K’ell Hunter halted and planted the tips of his swords in the ground. Gesler and Stormy continued on, halting five paces from the undead warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler called out, ‘What clan?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment it seemed the T’lan Imass would ignore the question, but then, in a heavy, rasping voice, the warrior said, ‘Logros, Malazan. I am Onos T’oolan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Onos—’ Gesler began, then snapped his mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy muttered a curse. ‘Can’t be. The First Sword? How many cronies of that long-dead rat-faced Emperor are involved in this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore T’lan Imass were coming down from the hill, ragged and slow, like the grinding of stones, and Gesler sensed something wretched in this scene, something … appalling. What are they doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnos T’oolan spoke. ‘Logros’s banishment of me was without meaning, Malazan. I knelt before a mortal human on the Throne of Bones, and there is none other whom I shall serve. This is what Olar Ethil did not comprehend. Bound once more to the Ritual of Tellann, I am returned to the shadow of the Emperor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler felt sick inside. He knew he was getting only a taste of what all this meant, but it was already breaking his heart. ‘He sent you, First Sword?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am invited to my own death, Malazan. The manner of it remains to be decided. If the One upon the Throne could see into my soul, he would know that I am broken.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Broken, you say?’ Stormy interrupted. ‘Now that’s an interesting fact, Onos T’oolan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient warrior tilted his head. ‘I do not understand your meaning.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy pointed north. ‘See that spire of rock, First Sword? Right up top of that, there’s something else – something just as broken as you are. The Forkrul Assail are guarding it – but we mean to take it from them. You say Kellanved ordered you here – so we got to know, First Sword, are you here to fight? And if you are, will it be against us or at our side?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are Malazans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The army behind us ain’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnos T’oolan was silent for a time, and then he said, ‘The K’Chain Che’Malle hunted Imass, from time to time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just like you hunted bhederin, or elk, or whatever. What of it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When we were mortal, we had cause to fear them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And elk will run when it sees you. But then, you’re not mortal any more, are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am here, Malazans, seeking a war. And yet only now do I realize that I have walked in shadow, all this time, since I first rose from the dust outside the city of Pale. I thought I was abandoned. And each time I sought a new path, that shadow followed me. That shadow found me, as it must. I am the First Sword of the T’lan Imass, and from this there is no escape.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler cleared his throat, blinked to work the water from his eyes. ‘First Sword, am I understanding you? Are you placing yourselves under our command – just because we happen to have come from the Malazan Empire? Before you answer, you’ve got to understand – Kellanved is long dead, and that empire has since outlawed us. We’re not here because of any damned throne, and we’re not at the beckoning of anyone who’s sitting in it either.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell me, then, human, why are you here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler looked up, studied the hundreds of T’lan Imass crowding the hillside, spilling out into the streets and avenues of the village. Lifeless faces were turned to him, and their regard was a crushing weight. Gods below . ‘It sounds … stupid, you know,’ he said, now eyeing Stormy, ‘when you just out and say it.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-366.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
