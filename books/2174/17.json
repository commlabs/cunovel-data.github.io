This is normal.\u0027 He turned, ducked out into the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 Lizbeth whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s the embryo,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027Didn\u0027t you hear?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. My head aches.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgan returned with a capsule and a cup of water, bent over Lizbeth. Take this. It\u0027ll settle your stomach.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey helped her sit up, held her while she swallowed the capsule. |\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a quavering breath, returned the cup. \u0027I\u0027m sorry to be such a-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Quite all right,\u0027 Igan said. He looked at Harvey. \u0027Best bring\u0027 her in the other room. Glisson will return in a few minutes. He should have food and a guide.\u0027 |\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey helped his wife to her feet, supported her as they followed Igan into the other room. They found Svengaard sitting up staring at his bound hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you been listening?\u0027 Igan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard looked at Lizbeth. \u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you thought about Seatac?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve thought.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re not thinking of releasing him,\u0027 Harvey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He slows us too much,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027And we cannot release him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen perhaps I should do something about him,\u0027 Harvey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do you suggest, Durant?\u0027 Boumour asked. \u0027He\u0027s a danger to us,\u0027 Harvey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ahh,\u0027 Boumour said. Then we leave him to you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Harvey!\u0027 Lizbeth said. She wondered if he\u0027d suddenly gone mad. Was this his reaction to her request that they seek Svengaard as her doctor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Harvey was remembering Lizbeth\u0027s moans. \u0027If it\u0027s him or my son,\u0027 he said, \u0027the choice is easy.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizbeth took his hand, signaled, \u0027What\u0027re you doing? You can\u0027t mean this!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What is he, anyway?\u0027 Harvey asked, staring at Igan. And he signaled Lizbeth, \u0027Wait. Watch:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read her husband, then pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s a gene surgeon,\u0027 Harvey said. His voice dripped scorn. \u0027He\u0027s existed for them. Can he justify his existence? He\u0027s a nonviable, nonliving nonentity. He has no future.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is that your choice?\u0027 Boumour asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard looked up at Harvey. \u0027Do you talk of murdering me?\u0027 he asked. The lack of emotion in his voice surprised Harvey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You don\u0027t protest?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard tried to swallow. His throat felt full of dry cotton. He looked at Harvey, measuring the bulk of the man, the corded muscles. He remembered the excessive male protective-ness in Harvey\u0027s nature, the gene-error that made him a slave to Lizbeth\u0027s slightest need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why should I argue,\u0027 Svengaard asked, \u0027when much of what he says is true and when he\u0027s already made up his mind?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How will you do it, Durant?\u0027 Boumour asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How would you like me to do it?\u0027 Harvey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Strangulation might be interesting,\u0027 Boumour said, and Harvey wondered if Svengaard, too, could hear the Cyborg clinical detachment in the man\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A simple snap of the neck is quicker,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Or an injection. I could supply several from my kit.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey felt Lizbeth trembling against him. He patted her arm, disengaged himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Harvey!\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, advanced on Svengaard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgan retreated to Boumour\u0027s side, stood watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey knelt behind Svengaard, closed his fingers around the surgeon\u0027s throat, bent close to the ear opposite his audience. In a whisper audible only to Svengaard, Harvey said, \u0027They would as soon see you dead. They don\u0027t care one way or another. How do you feel about it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard felt the hands on his throat. He knew he could reach up with his bound hands and try to remove those clutching fingers, but he knew he\u0027d fail. There was no doubting Harvey\u0027s strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Your own choice?\u0027 Harvey whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do it man!\u0027 Boumour called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly seconds ago, Svengaard realized, he\u0027d been resigned to death, wanted death. Suddenly, that wish was the farthest thing from his desires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I want to live,\u0027 he husked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is that your choice?\u0027 Harvey whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you talking to him?\u0027 Boumour asked. \u0027Why do you want to live?\u0027 Harvey asked in a normal voice. He relaxed his fingers slightly, a subtle communication to Svengaard. Even an untrained person could read this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Because I\u0027ve never been alive,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027I want to try it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But how can you justify your existence?\u0027 Harvey asked, and he allowed his fingers to tighten ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard looked at Lizbeth, sensing at last the direction of Harvey\u0027s thoughts. He glanced at Boumour and Igan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You haven\u0027t answered my question,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027What are you discussing with our prisoner?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are they both Cyborgs?\u0027 Svengaard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Irretrievably,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027Without human feelings - or near enough to it that it makes no difference.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen how can you trust them with your wife\u0027s care?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey\u0027s fingers relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is a way I could justify my existence,\u0027 Svengaard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey removed his hands from Svengaard\u0027s throat, squeezed the man\u0027s shoulders. It was instant communication, more than words, something that went from flesh to flesh. Svengaard knew he had an ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour crossed to stand over them, demanded, \u0027Are you going to kill him or aren\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No one here\u0027s going to kill him,\u0027 Harvey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what\u0027ve you been doing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Solving a problem,\u0027 Harvey said. He kept a hand on Svengaard\u0027s arm. Svengaard found he could understand Harvey\u0027s intent just by the pressure of that hand. It said, \u0027Wait. Be still. Lei me handle this.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And what is your intention now toward our prisoner?\u0027 Boumour demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I intend to free him and put my wife in his care,\u0027 Harvey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour glared at him. \u0027And if that incurs our displeasure?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What idiocy!\u0027 Igan blared. \u0027How can you trust him when we\u0027re available?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a fellow human,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027What he does for my wife will be out of humanity and not like a mechanic treating her as a machine for transporting an embryo.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is nonsense!\u0027 Igan snapped. But he realized then that Harvey had recognized their Cyborg nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour raised a hand to silence him as Igan started to continue talking. \u0027You have not indicated how you will do this if we oppose it,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re not full Cyborgs,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027I see in you fears and uncertainties. It\u0027s new to you and you\u0027re changing. I suspect you\u0027re very vulnerable yet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour backed off three steps, his eyes measuring Harvey. \u0027And Glisson?\u0027 Boumour asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Glisson wants only trustworthy allies,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027I\u0027m giving him a trustworthy ally.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How do you know you can trust Svengaard?\u0027 Igan demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Because you have to ask, you betray your ineffectiveness,\u0027 Harvey said. He turned, began unfastening Svengaard\u0027s fetters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s on your head,\u0027 Boumour said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey freed Svengaard\u0027s hands, knelt and removed the bindings from his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m going for Glisson,\u0027 Igan said. He left the room. Harvey stood up, faced Svengaard. \u0027Do you know about my wife\u0027s condition?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I heard Igan,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Every surgeon studies history and genetic origins. I have an academic knowledge of her condition.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s Igan\u0027s medical kit,\u0027 Harvey said, pointing to the black case on the floor. \u0027Tell me why my wife was sick.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re not satisfied with Igan\u0027s explanation?\u0027 Boumour asked. He appeared outraged by the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He said it was natural,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027How can sickness be natural?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She has received medication,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Do you know what it was?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It had the same markings as the pill he gave her in the van.\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027A tranquilizer he called it then.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard approached Lizbeth, looked at her eyes, her skin. \u0027Bring the kit,\u0027 he said, nodding to Harvey. He guided Lizbeth to an empty pad, finding himself fascinated by the idea of this examination. Once he had thought of this as disgusting; now, the idea that Lizbeth carried an embryo in her in the ancient way held only mystery for him, a profound curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizbeth sent a questioning look at Harvey as Svengaard eased her back onto the pad. Harvey nodded reassuringly. She \u0027tried to smile, but a strange fear had come over her. The fear didn\u0027t originate with Svengaard. His hands were full of gentle assurance. But the prospect of being examined frightened her. She could feel terror warring with the drug Igan had given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard opened the kit, remembering the diagrams and explanations from the study tapes of his school years. They had been the subject of ribald jokes then, but even the jokes helped him now because they tended to fix vital facts in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCling to the wall, for if you fall, You then must learn to do the crawl!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his memory, he could hear the chant and the uproarious burst of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard bent to his examination, excluding all else but the patient and himself. Blood pressure... enzymes... hormone production... bodily secretions...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, he sat back, frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is something wrong?\u0027 Harvey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour stood, arms folded, behind Harvey. \u0027Yes, do tell us,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Menstrual hormone complex is much too high,\u0027 Svengaard said. And he thought, \u0027Cling to the wall...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe embryo controls these changes,\u0027 Boumour sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027But why this shift in hormone production?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027From your superior knowledge, you\u0027ll now tell us,\u0027 Boumour said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard ignored the mocking tone, looked up at Boumour. \u0027You\u0027ve done this before. Have you had any spontaneous abortions in your patients?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well?\u0027 Svengaard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A few.\u0027 He supplied the information grudgingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I suspect the embryo isn\u0027t firmly attached to the endometrium,\u0027 Svengaard said. To the wall of the uterus,\u0027 he said, recognizing Harvey\u0027s need for explanation. The embryo must cling to the uterus wall. The way of this is prepared by hormones present during the menstrual cycle.\u0027 Boumour shrugged. \u0027Well, we expect to lose a certain percentage.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My wife is not a certain percentage,\u0027 Harvey growled. He turned, focused a glare on Boumour that sent the man retreating three steps. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-17.html","bookId":2174,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM"}
