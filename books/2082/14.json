Then she realized that she was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shaking, Raksha Keller who wasn\u0027t afraid of anyone and who never let her heart be touched. She was making those ridiculous little noises that sounded like a six-week-old kitten. She was dripping tears through her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst thing was that she couldn\u0027t seem to make herself stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she felt Galen\u0027s arms around her, and she realized that he was crying, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was better at it than she was. He seemed more used to it and didn\u0027t fight it as hard, which made him stronger. He was able to stroke her hair and even to get some words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keller, I\u0027m sorry. Keller... can I call you Raksha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller shook her head furiously, spraying teardrops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always think of you as Keller, anyway. It\u0027s just-you, somehow. I\u0027m sorry about all of this. I didn\u0027t mean to make you cry. It would be better if you\u0027d never met me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller found herself shaking her head again. And then, just as she had the last time, she felt her arms moving to hold him back. She pressed her face against the softness of his sweatshirt, trying to get enough control of herself to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the problem with having walls so hard and high and unscalable, she supposed. When they came down, they crumbled completely, shattering into nothingness. She felt utterly defenseless right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnguarded... vulnerable... but not alone. She could feel more than Galen\u0027s physical presence. She could feel his spirit, and she was being pulled toward it. They were falling together, falling into each other, as they had in the library. Closer and closer...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the touch of his mind, and once again her heart almost exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re the one. You\u0027re my soulmate, his mental voice said, as if this were an entirely new idea, and he was just discovering it and rejoicing in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller reached for denial, but it simply wasn\u0027t around. And she couldn\u0027t pretend to someone who shared her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first saw you, he said, I was so fascinated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby you. I already told you this, didn\u0027t I? It made me proud to be a shapeshifter for the first time. Aren\u0027t you proud?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was disconcerted. She still wasn\u0027t finished crying-but, yes, she was. With his warmth and passion shining into her, his arms locked around her, his mind open to her... it was hard not to get swept up in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I\u0027m proud, she thought to him slowly. But only of some parts of it. Other things...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat things? he demanded, almost fiercely protective. Our history? The dragons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Stuff you wouldn\u0027t understand Things about-animal nature. Even now, Keller was afraid of letting him see some parts of her. Leave it alone, Galen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he said was, Tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It happened a long time ago, when I was three. Just be glad you get to pick what kind of animal you\u0027ll become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, he said. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t like animal nature, she told him. Remember how you pulled your hand away when you touched my shoulder in the music room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the... ? His mental voice trailed off, and Keller waited grimly to feel the memory of disgust in him. But what came wasn\u0027t revulsion. Instead, it was a strong sense of longing that he was somehow trying to smother. And choked, wry laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, I didn\u0027t pull away because I didn\u0027t like your fur. I did it because . . He hesitated, then burst out, sounding embarrassed, I wanted to pet you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePet... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour fur was so soft, and it felt so good when I moved my palm the wrong way against it-just like velvet. And-I wanted to-to do this. He ran a hand up and down her back. I couldn\u0027t help it. But I knew it wasn\u0027t exactly appropriate, and you would probably break my jaw if I tried it. So I took my hand away. He finished, still embarrassed, but half laughing. Now, you tell me what you\u0027re not proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller felt very warm, and she was sure her face was flushed. It was just as well that it was hidden. It was too bad-there was probably never going to be a time to tell him that she wouldn\u0027t mind being petted like that...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a cat, after all, she thought, and was distantly surprised to hear him chuckle. There were no secrets in this kind of soul-link, she realized, slightly flustered. To cover her embarrassment, she spoke out loud. \"The thing I\u0027m not proud of-it happened when I was living with my first Circle Daybreak family. I used to spend a lot of time in my half-and-half form. It was easy for me to get stuck that way, and they didn\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t, either, Galen said. You\u0027re beautiful like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, I was sitting on my foster mother\u0027s lap while she was combing my hair, and I don\u0027t know what happened, but something startled me. Some loud noise outside, maybe a car backfiring. I jumped straight up and tried to race for my hiding place under the desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller paused, made herself take an even breath. She felt Galen\u0027s arms tighten around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then-well, my foster mother tried to hold on to me, to keep me from being frightened. But all I could think of was danger, danger. So I lashed out at her. I used my claws-I have retractable claws in that form. I would have done anything to get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused again. It was so hard to tell this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had to go to the hospital. I forget how many stitches she needed in her face. But I remember everything else-being taken to another foster family because that one couldn\u0027t handle me. I didn\u0027t blame them for sending me away, but I always wished I could have told her how sorry I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Keller could feel Galen breathing, and that gave her an odd sense of comfort. Then he said quietly, out loud, \"That\u0027s all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller started, then lifted her head a little and made herself answer the same way. \"Isn\u0027t it enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keller... you were just a baby. You didn\u0027t mean to do any harm; it was an accident. You can\u0027t blame yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do blame myself. If I hadn\u0027t been taken over by my instinct-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous. Human babies do stupid things all the time. What if a human three-year-old falls into a swimming pool and somebody drowns trying to rescue her? Would you blame the baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller hesitated, then rested her head on his shoulder again. \"Don\u0027t be silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how can you blame yourself for something you couldn\u0027t help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller didn\u0027t answer, but she felt as if a crushing load was sliding slowly off her. He didn\u0027t blame her. Maybe she wasn\u0027t to blame. She would always be sorry, but maybe she didn\u0027t need to be so ashamed. She tightened her own arms around him. Thank you, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Keller. You\u0027re so wonderful, and you\u0027re so set against admitting it. Everything you do... shines. Keller couldn\u0027t form any words for a moment. Then she said, Galen? When you do choose a form, choose something gentle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought you thought everybody has to be a fitter, he said, and his mental voice was very quiet. Some people shouldn\u0027t have to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she just let him hold her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother endless time, while they both seemed to be floating in soft, gold fire. It flared around them and through them, joining them. Sometimes she could hardly tell which thoughts were his and which were hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, I used to write poetry, you know. Or try. My parents hated it; they were so embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of learning to be a good hunter, their son was writing gibberish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, There\u0027s this terrible dream I have, where I look out at the ocean and see a wall of water hundreds of feet high, and I know it\u0027s coming and I can never get away in time. Cats and water, you know. I guess that\u0027s why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, I used to daydream about what kind of animal it would be most fun to be. But it always came down to the same thing, some kind of bird. You just can\u0027t beat flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, One thing I always had to hide from my foster mothers was how much I liked to shred things. I thought I was being so clever when I would hide their panty hose after I used my claws on them. But when I did it on the sheer curtains one day, everybody knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked and talked. And Keller gave herself up to it, to the simple pleasure of his closeness and the feeling that for once she didn\u0027t have to hide or pretend or defend herself. It was such a blessed relief not to have to pretend at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen knew her, and he accepted her. All of her. He loved herself, not her black swirling hair or her long legs or the curve of her lips. He might admire those things, but he loved her, what she was inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he loved her with a sweetness and a power that shook Keller to her soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to stay like this forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something else waiting for them, though. Something she didn\u0027t want to think about but that loomed just outside the brightness and warmth that surrounded them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world... there\u0027s still a world out there. And it\u0027s in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we can\u0027t ignore that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery slowly, very reluctantly, Galen straightened, putting her away from him. He couldn\u0027t seem to let go of her shoulders, though. They sat that way, their eyes locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the strange thing was that the mental connection wasn\u0027t broken. They could still hear each other as they held each other\u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can never be like this again, Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. He had faced it as clearly as she had, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t talk about it; we can\u0027t even be alone together. It isn\u0027t fair to Uiana. And we have to try to forget each other and just go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, he said for the third time. And just when Keller was marveling at his quiet acceptance, she saw tears in his gem-colored eyes. Keller, it\u0027s my fault. If I weren\u0027t the son of the First House...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d never have met. And that would have been worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would it?\" he said out loud, as if he needed reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. She gave the answer mentally, so that he could feel the truth of it. Oh, Galen, I\u0027m so glad we met. I\u0027m so glad to have known you. And if we live through this, I\u0027ll be glad all my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her into his arms again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have it, Boss,\" Winnie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were sparkling. Beside her, Nissa looked calmly enthusiastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Keller asked. She herself felt calmly alert, in spite of almost no sleep the night before. She and Galen had stayed up late, reading over the scrolls, making sure that there was nothing they had missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had already explained what they\u0027d found to the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Winnie was grinning at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How to protect Iliana at the party on Saturday. We\u0027ve got it, and it\u0027s foolproof!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing is foolproof, Keller thought. She said, \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like this. We put wards all around the Ashton-Hughes house, just like the wards Grandma Harman made for this house. The strongest possible from Circle Daybreak. But we put them around the house now, as soon as we can. We key them so that only humans can get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we add another layer of protection,\" Nissa said. \"Circle Daybreak agents posted around the house, starting now. Nothing gets in, nothing gets out that they don\u0027t know about. That way, when we go to the party on Saturday, we know it\u0027s safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just whisk her from one safe place to another,\" Winnie said. \"As long as we can keep her in here until Saturday night, there\u0027s-no chance of any danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller considered. \"We have to make sure the limo is safe, too. Absolutely safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Winnie said. \u0027Ill take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027d want agents to check the people who go hi somehow. Not just monitor. Would there be any way to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without the family knowing?\" Nissa chewed her lip gently. \"What if we set up some sort of road crew near the front gate? There\u0027s bound to be a gate; this is a mansion, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check it out. And we\u0027d better get plans of the house, too. I want us all to know the place by heart before we get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"City planner\u0027s office,\" Nissa said. \"No, more likely the local historical society. The house is probably a historic monument. I\u0027m on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller nodded. \"Hmm.\" She tried to think if there was anything else to worry about. \"Hmm, it sounds...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched her, breath held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds good,\" Keller said. \"I think there\u0027s just the tiniest, slightest possibility that it might actually work. But I\u0027m probably being overoptimistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie grinned and socked her on the shoulder. \"You, Boss? Perish the thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s so difficult,\" Iliana said. \"I mean, what can you wear to both a birthday party and a promise ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a Solstice Ceremony,\" Winnie said. \"Don\u0027t forget that\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to make things worse, aren\u0027t you?\" Iliana held up one dress, then another. \"What\u0027s right for a Solstice Ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something white,\" Winnie suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be good for a promise ceremony, too,\" Keller said. She was doing her very best to be patient, and finding it easier than she had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last three days had been very quiet Iliana had agreed to stay home from school even when her cold got better. Galen and Keller had scarcely spoken in that time, and they had never been alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was... all right. There was a quietness inside her to match the quiet air outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both had jobs to do. And they would do them as well as possible. Keller just prayed that what they did would be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"White? I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve got anything white. It has to be fancy because everything at Jaime\u0027s is fancy. I hope she\u0027s really okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine,\" Keller said. \"You talked to her an hour ago.\" To her own relief, Jaime had stayed quietly at home for the past three days, too. The last thing she wanted was for that girl to be attacked again. But the Ashton-Hughes house, at least, was safe. For three days, it had been buttoned up tight, with Circle Daybreak agents watching every person who went through the gates. And checking them, using the same wards that protected the house. No Night Person could cross the invisible line that encircled the grounds, and no person who tried to cross and was turned back by the wards would be allowed to leave without being tracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll we have to do is keep her safe during the drive, Keller thought. First to the mansion, then to the meeting place in Charlotte. We can do that. I know we can do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked her watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, kid, it\u0027s after eight,\" she said. \"We should be moving soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIliana and Winnie were both ransacking the closet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pale blue,\" Winnie said, \"pale lavender, pale pink...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be white,\" Iliana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I mentioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded on the door, and Nissa looked in. \"We\u0027re back. You guys ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a minute,\" Keller said. \"How\u0027re things at the mansion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect. The witches say the wards are strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caterers and a college band. That\u0027s all so far. All one hundred percent human according to the wards-and to Galen, who kept running up to the cars at the gate and trying to sell them Christmas Benefit teddy bears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller almost grinned. Galen would be good at that. \"The family must have thought he was crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They never came out and complained. Nobody\u0027s come out, in fact, which makes things easy on die surveillance team.\" She sobered. \"Boss, why do you think the dragon hasn\u0027t tried something yet? He\u0027s cutting it awfully close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I think...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he must be betting it all on one throw of the dice. One all-out attack, fast and decisive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the parry,\" Keller said. \"So we\u0027d better be on our toes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got him locked out, though. Those wards are secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the closet, Iliana squealed, \"I found it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was holding a dress almost the color of her own hair, white with some sort of sparkling thread woven in. It draped in soft folds across her hip as she held it up for Winnie\u0027s inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Winnie said. \"You can get engaged in that dress; you can go to a birthday parry; you can celebrate the Solstice-you can probably get married in it if you want\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do whatever you want, but you have to do it now,\" Keller said, checking her watch again. \"But do you like it? I think I bought it last year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s beautiful,\" Keller said, and then, as she saw the hurt in Hiana\u0027s violet eyes: \"Really. It\u0027s beautiful. You\u0027ll look wonderful in it, and Galen will be-very impressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had that sudden hitch in her breath come from? She had gotten over it quickly, but she noticed that Diana gave her an odd look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, come on, everybody,*\u0027 Keller said briskly, looking at Winnie and Nissa. \"Are you two ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both looked down at their ordinary outfits, then looked back up and shrugged in chorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I guess they can think we\u0027re the help,\" Keller said. \"Everybody check your transmitters. I want to be in constant contact once we get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it, Boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIliana had put on the dress and was looking in the mirror. \"My hair,\" she began, and then she glanced at Keller. \"Ill just leave it down,\" she said. \"Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down is fine, down is great.\" Keller glanced at her watch and tightened her belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down is just right for a Solstice Ceremony,\" Winnie said. She added in an undertone as Iliana started for the door, \"Don\u0027t mind her. She\u0027s always like this before a big operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a good thing I didn\u0027t ask her about my shoes....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller looked around to make sure there was nothing they were forgetting. Then she looked at the other three girls. They smiled back at her, eyes alert and ready for anything. Even the smallest one, who looked like a Christmas tree angel somebody had taken down and brought to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, people,\" Keller said. \"This is it. It\u0027s show time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen was wearing a dark sweater and pants that set off his blondness. It was casual but still appropriate for the promise ceremony later on. His eyes met Keller\u0027s briefly as Iliana said good-bye to her parents, and they both smiled. Not fake smiles, either. Simply the quiet, undemanding smiles of comrades with a job to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kee-kee!\" Alex said from the door as they went to the car in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat kid is up way too late, Keller thought She turned and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blow him a kiss,\" Diana prompted helpfully. \"He likes that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller gave her a narrow sideways look and blew him a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kee-kee!\" Suddenly, his round little face crumpled. \"Bye-bye,\" he proclaimed sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s sweet,\" Diana\u0027s mother said. \"He\u0027s going to miss you. He probably thinks you\u0027re going for good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye-bye,\" Alex said, and huge tears rolled down his cheeks. \"Bye-bye! Kee-kee! Bye-bye!\" He began to sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a little silence among the group standing by the car. Winnie stared at Alex, then glanced at Iliana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t-he\u0027s never had any precognitions, has he?\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a baby,\" Iliana whispered back. \u00271 mean, how could you tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just tired,\" Keller said briefly. \"Come on, let\u0027s go.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-14.html","bookId":2082,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM"}
