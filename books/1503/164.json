In addition to that, Zhou Weiqing had taken out 450,000 gold coins for his classmates to Store Skills, which further ‘bought’ more popularity. Including his inspiring speech about being human and having backbones, he had in that instant gotten the acceptance of all his classmates. The next step of his plan would be to continually influence them throughout the next few years, causing them to feel a sense of reliance on him. Four years was a long time, and he was confident of letting these classmates around him to see him as a leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavenly Bow Empire was just too weak now. After witnessing the true power of the Fei Li Empire, only then did Zhou Weiqing see the huge difference, to see how weak his own country really was. In order to strengthen it slowly, the first thing was to recruit more talents. How many Jewel Masters were there in the entire Heavenly Bow Empire? Furthermore, those commoners who could enter the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy were all extremely great talents with various individual skills… not just in terms of individual power as Jewel Masters, but also military capabilities! If he could recruit just some of them for his use, it would be the first stepping stone in his ambition of building up the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing believed that his father had originally thought like that as well. However, although his father was extremely powerful, he did not have the conditions necessary to draw in other Jewel Masters to follow him. However, Zhou Weiqing was different, with his status as a Consolidating Equipment Master, especially since his teacher Huyan Aobo had recognized his talents as a Consolidating Equipment Master as sheer genius. With such a status, he believed that he could totally draw in talents follow him. In such a school like the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy, where there were tons of talents and different genius in various fields around, if he just simply only studied for four years, that would be an immense waste of opportunity. After all, no matter how powerful, there was ultimately a limit to what a single person. Just like Admiral Zhou, as a powerful Mid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, and a talented military genius to boot, he was still unable to change the fact that the Heavenly Bow Empire was in trouble, barely able to hold their enemies at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just because of this grand plan and ambition he had in his heart that Zhou Weiqing had sparked such a strong killing instinct in his heart after getting threatened by Ming Hua. Plans were just that - plans, and they were always subjected to the countless myriad of changes from the world around. What he had to do was to... deal with all these outside influences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sense of danger that Ming Hua had brought to him had also caused him to lose his patience in slowly bringing the commoner students to his side, instead throwing out his conditions directly to the seniors. He could not afford to wait til he became a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master before starting to attract followers, as that would be way too late. To strengthen his country, it had to be done so step by step, over time. The path to him becoming a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was still long and winding, and it would take him a long time to do so, time which the Heavenly Bow Empire did not have, with the pressure from the Kalise Empire who was now supported by the Bai Da Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for whether or not Zang Lang and the other seniors would follow him, Zhou Weiqing had no idea. As such, he needed to display not just his strength, but also his personality and attitude, and most especially his power as a Consolidating Equipment Master. To draw these talents in following him, he had to attract them with everything he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the classroom, Zhou Weiqing was surprised to see that all the classmates had not left, and they were chit chatting with each other. Shangguan Bing’er was surrounded by a few of the other female students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that Zhou Weiqing had returned, the entire classroom instantly quietened down. Zhou Weiqing realised what was up, and went up to the podium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing both his hands on the podium, he said: “Let me just say a few words, and everyone should go back to rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s gaze fell onto Zhou Weiqing, and those who were standing also returned to their seats. Today, Zhou Weiqing had displayed his sheer combat power and his status as a Consolidating Equipment Master, in addition to the promise of helping upkeep them, all of them were looking up to him with much admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had a faint smile on his face. At this moment, he looked just like a innocent, harmless boy. “Later, when all of you are registering with Kou Rui, you should clearly state your Heavenly Energy cultivation level. For Elemental Jewel Masters, if you want to Skill Store, just register with Yan Zhexi, he will be the guardian of the storage card. Every weekend, during our day’s break from the Academy, those who have registered can go together with him, and he will pay. In the future, I will be selling some extra Consolidating Equipment Scrolls to replenish the funds as well, so no worries about it running out too quickly. As for Physical Jewel Masters, when you register, do note what your Physical Jewel Attribute is, as well as what sort of route you are looking to develop to, and what sort of weapon you wish to Consolidate. In that way, I can design your Consolidating Equipment Scrolls according to your personal needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he paused a moment. He could obviously see the effect of his words on the rest of the students, especially when he talked about the personalized Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, many of their eyes lit up. There were more Physical Jewel Masters than Elemental Jewel Masters, and their need for Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were extremely high, not to mention having them designed specially for their needs! This was something that not even those Heavenly Jewel Masters who submit to noble families or the Skill Storing Palace may not enjoy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled in satisfaction and continued: “I also have another suggestion. If it is a Physical Jewel Master who does not have a single piece of Consolidated Equipment, you should register for one quickly, to ensure you have one for self protection. However, if you already have a piece of Consolidated Equipment, you might want to wait a little while and concentrate on cultivating your Heavenly Energy. Within two years, I believe I will be able to become a high level Consolidating Equipment Master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At that time, I should be able to start trying to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls with sockets, or even start on Consolidating Equipment Sets. Of course, those with sockets are only useful for Heavenly Jewel Masters, but Consolidating Equipment Sets will be great even for ordinary Physical Jewel Masters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we were to describe the eyes of the students earlier to be fanatical, they were now dazed and dumbfounded. Consolidated Equipment with sockets? Consolidated Equipment Sets? Those things were almost myths to them, not only had they not seen them before, they had barely even dreamed about them before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that his speech had done his intended effect, Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Alright, that’s all I have to say. Of course, that is just my suggestion, if anyone is unable to wait, you can still go ahead and register for Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. I can at least guarantee you will succeed in Consolidating Equipment… if a single set isn’t able to do it, we’ll just do a second set. Bing’er, please stand up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er started upon hearing Zhou Weiqing call upon her, but of course she wouldn’t not give him face now, and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s smile sudden disappeared and he said seriously: “All classmates, now, let me reintroduce this person to you all seriously. This beautiful young lady is Shangguan Bing’er, my wife. In the future, none of you other guys are allowed to have any designs on her… if not… heh heh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, what are you saying!” Shangguan Bing’er started in surprise, before blushing deep red and running out of the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKou Rui grinned and shouted out: “Sister in law!” And all the rest of the class burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had an extraordinarily thick skin, and he did not care about the teasing, instead waving towards the rest of the class in farewell before chasing after Shangguan Bing’er. As soon as he left, Kou Rui was immediately surrounded by the rest of the classmates, everyone just so eager to register themselves. Even Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun, the two Heavenly Jewel Masters, were no different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing ran all the way to the entrance of the academy before he finally caught up to Shangguan Bing’er. “Bing’er, slower! Wait for me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er turned her head around, flushed totally red as she scolded him: “What were you saying just now! How can I face our classmates next time!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Who asked you to be so beautiful, so enchanting! I had to declare my ownership…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly: “What ownership? Am I an object? Hmph!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing immediately shook his head. “No, no, of course not. What I meant is, to proclaim that you own me, I am your Little Fatty after all! Look at me, I’m so handsome and suave, gentle and kind, honest yet cute, and I also know how to make Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Now, if other beauties try to chase me, what could I possibly do? This way, I can proclaim that you already own me, and know that I belong to you, who dares to try to chase me… even if they do, they’ll have to compare themselves to you right? If they try comparing themselves to you… they’ll be ashamed and run off. See, this is all for your sake!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at his shameless proclamation, Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but giggle. “Gentle and kind… hahaha. I am pretty sure that many people think of you of some fierce monster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that she was no longer angry, Zhou Weiqing immediately went closer to her, holding her by her slim waist as he grinned and said: “As long as my dear Bing’er doesn’t treat me as a monster, that is fine…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said in a serious tone: “Little Fatty, what you did today, was it to recruit all our classmates in the future to help our Heavenly Bow Empire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “It’s still too early to tell, but all you need to know is that I, your husband, has a long term goal in mind. Don’t worry, I will handle it well, you just need to concentrate on studying, and I will deal with the other things To be honest, just looking at the class schedule today gave me a headache… I do not have any foundation in military matters, and I doubt I can learn much from there. In the future, I’ll have to depend on you, especially for examinations… remember to let me copy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er furrowed her brow: “Little Fatty, that will not do… How about, I help tutor you in some of \u0026nbsp;the foundations of military knowledge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No, I do not have the time for that. To upkeep that whole class of students, it isn’t that easy. Just creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for them and for sale, and cultivating my own Heavenly Energy, that will take up all of my spare time. As for studying, whatever I can pick up from classes, so be it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said rather worriedly: “But… you need to succeed Admiral Zhou in the future, to lead our Heavenly Bow Empire armies!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Bing’er, you haven’t understood what I meant. As a commander in chief, I feel that it isn’t totally necessary to be great in every aspect of military matters. As long as I have the ability to command a group of outstanding military talents, that would be sufficient…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er started in surprise as she mulled through his words. Although she felt that Zhou Weiqing’s words were rather warped logic, but it did make sense in a way. Having spent the past two years in the Heavenly Bow Unit, Zhou Weiqing had changed a lot, not just in his stature, but his original scoundrel ways had also been well hidden from the world now. On the surface, he sometimes seemed arrogant, but she knew that he had just kept all his true feelings and emotions hidden. Although he wasn’t even seventeen years old yet, he was already much more mature and reserved than most adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-47-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-48-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-48-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
