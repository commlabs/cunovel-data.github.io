The impression that the Blood Red Hell left upon her was just too deep. She muttered: “Weiqing, you don’t know the extent of their power… they have many top powerhouses in the Blood Red Hell.

They are planning to end things here once and for all; they are not just here to finish off the rest of your Heavenly Demon Sect, they are also planning to crush the core of our Heavenly Bow Empire. With that accomplished, there will no longer be anyone left in the west that can restrain them. Their plans are lofty and high reaching indeed, but their calculations might not be too accurate.

That was the Dan Dun Empire was truly planning on moving against the ZhongTian Empire.

The Blood Red Hell would not be able to focus all of the power here. That also meant that while it was a chance for the Blood Red Hell to exterminate their side, wasn’t it also a great opportunity for them to greatly weaken the power of the Blood Red Hell?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing naturally had his own thoughts and opinions. Previously, in the battle for the Heavenly Bow City Royal Palace, he had not allowed any of the six Blood Red Hell powerhouses to escape. The main reason for that was because he did not want the Blood Red Hell to have a proper understanding of the true power on their side. Even if they knew he had reached the Heavenly King stage, so what? The power range of a Heavenly King was just too huge, and it was unlikely that they could even imagine that he had already reached a stage where he was able to fight against a Heavenly Emperor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThinking up to this point, Zhou Weiqing turned to Little Witch and said: “Yuehan, hurry up, lead me to chase after father-in-law. We will need to plan properly. Since the Blood Red Hell powerhouses have come, there is no need for them to leave this place forever.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWu Yuehan saw the confidence in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and her own emotions were soon influenced by him. She realised that this fellow who had been inferior to her previously had now come into his, growing into a true powerhouse that had his place in the world. The warm and gentle Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing infused into her body had also helped her heart calm down. Nodding, she pulled on his hand as they walked out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this point, whether or not the Heavenly Demon Sect changed its name or not was not the important issue. They had to first deal with the threat of the Blood Red Hell first. Once the situation was resolved, if the Heavenly Demon Sect still survived, then everything was possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing held great anticipation for this upcoming battle. The chances for both sides were equal. If the Blood Red Hell emerged victorious, then the pieces would all fall into place for them, and they would not leave any of them alive. At the same time, if Zhou Weiqing’s side were to emerge victorious, he would be able to display his own power to the Heavenly Demon Sect powerhouses. Under such a circumstance, it would be easier for him to establish his own Great Saint Land and incorporate the Heavenly Demon Sect under him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA day passed just like that in the blink of an eye.

I believe that the previous defeat of Meng Gui has to do with the Heavenly Demon Sect. Just the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor alone would not have been able to deal with so many at once.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this point, the First Grand Elder said: “They are here.” As he spoke, his long fiery red brow raised up. Without any other instructions from him, the over twenty Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind them spread out, releasing their powerful auras without holding back.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOne after the other, figures appeared in the sight of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses. There were three figures right at the front, but to the surprise of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, amongst the three, the one in the center position was not the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue nor the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, but a young man.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis young man looked to be only around twenty years old, dressed in black. On the surface, he looked just like an ordinary young man who had just become a Heavenly Jewel Master, and the Blood Red Hell powerhouses did not sense any threat from him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSix others followed behind them, all dressed in grey. These six were the last powerhouses of the Heavenly Demon Sect, six Heavenly Kings.

Eight of them were Heavenly Kings, the rest were nine-Jeweled and eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter all, even if the Blood Red Hell had been preparing for a long time, it was not that easy to groom a Heavenly King powerhouse.
