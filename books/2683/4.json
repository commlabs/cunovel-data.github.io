Peyton stands there looking hopefully up at me, quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, Peyton, you\u0027re really whacked out, aren\u0027t you?\" I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShamefully, Peyton nods as if coaxed. He looks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had a pretty tough life, right?\" I ask gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, please.\" JD steps in. \"Peyton was joking about the specks. We\u0027re not saving the specks. I\u0027m with you. They\u0027re just not worth it. They die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile lighting a gargantuan joint, camcorder guy shoots out the huge expanse of French windows, the lens staring at a view of a leafless Union Square Park, at a truck with a massive Snapple logo driving by, limousines parked at a curb. We are moving down another set of stairs, heading toward the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will someone please just give me one spontaneous act of goodness? Remove the specks. Bongo, go back to the kitchen. Kenny Kenny, you get a consolation prize. Peyton, make sure Kenny Kenny gets a couple of colanders and a nice flat spatula.\" I wave them off, glaring. We leave Kenny Kenny behind, on the verge of tears, rubbing a shaky hand over the tattoo of Casper the Friendly Ghost on his bicep. \"Ciao.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Victor. The average life span of a club is what-four weeks? By the time we close, no one\u0027s gonna notice them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s your attitude, JD, there\u0027s the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Victor, let\u0027s be realistic-or at least fake it. This isn\u0027t 1987 anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not in a realistic mood, JD, so spare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassing a pool table, I grab the 8 ball and slam-roll it into the corner pocket. The group is moving farther down into the club. We\u0027re now at the first floor and it\u0027s getting darker and Peyton introduces me to a huge black guy with wraparound sunglasses standing by the front entrance eating takeout sushi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, this is Abdullah, but we shall call him Rocko, and he\u0027s handling all the security and he was in that TLC video directed by Matthew Ralston. That toro looks good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My middle name is Grand Master B.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His middle name is Grand Master B,\" JD says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shook hands last week in South Beach,\" Abdullah tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nice, Abdullah, but I wasn\u0027t in South Beach last week even though I\u0027m semi-famous there.\" I glance over at the Details girl. \"You can write that down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah man, you were in the lobby of the Flying Dolphin, getting your photo taken,\" Rocko tells me. \"You were surrounded by clams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m not looking at Rocko. Instead my eyes have focused on the three metal detectors that line the foyer, a giant white chandelier hanging above them, dimly twinkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did, um, know about these, right?\" JD asks. A meek pause. \"Damien... wants them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien wants what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um.\" Peyton gestures with his arms as if the metal detectors were prizes. \"These.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why don\u0027t we just throw in a baggage check-in, a couple of stewardesses and a DC-10? I mean, what in the hell are these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is security, man,\" Abdullah says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security? Why don\u0027t you just spend the night frisking the celebrities as well?\" I ask. \"What? You think this is a party for felons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mickey Rourke and Johnny Depp both RSVP\u0027d yes for dinner,\" Peyton whispers in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d like us to frisk the guests-\" Rocko starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I\u0027m gonna have Donna Karan frisked? I\u0027m gonna have Marky Mark frisked? I\u0027m gonna have f**king Diane Von Furstenberg frisked?\" I shout. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, baby,\" Peyton says. \"You\u0027re going to have the metal detectors so Diane Von Furstenberg and Marky Mark aren\u0027t frisked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chuck Pfeiffer has a metal plate in his goddamned head! Princess Cuddles has a steel rod in her leg?\" I shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJD tells the girl reporter, \"Skiing accident in Gstaad, and don\u0027t ask me how to spell that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s gonna happen when Princess Cuddles walks in through one of these things and alarms go off and buzzers and lights and\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; Jesus, she\u0027ll have a f**king heart attack. Does anybody really want to see Princess Cuddles have a coronary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the guest list we\u0027ll mark down that Chuck Pfeiffer has a metal plate in his head and that Princess Cuddles has a steel cod in her leg,\" Peyton says, mindlessly writing it down on a notepad. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-4.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
