I heard what sounded like rock hitting rock somewhere on the back side of his house. As I rounded the corner, I spied Archer, shirtless, on his hands and knees laying stones for what looked like the beginning of a side patio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I said softly, and his head snapped up. He looked slightly surprised, but… pleased? Maybe? He certainly wasn\u0027t the easiest person to read, especially since I couldn\u0027t see all of his features clearly under his beard and the hair that fell over his forehead and around his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and raised his hand, indicating a big rock that was sitting to the right of his project and went back to his work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had left the diner at two and then gone home and taken a quick shower, gotten on my bike and ridden out to Archer\u0027s. I had left Phoebe with Anne because I wasn\u0027t sure if other dogs should be around the puppies yet or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I had arrived at Archer\u0027s gate, I hadn\u0027t been able to help the smile that overtook my face when I saw that it was very slightly open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way over to the rock he had just indicated and sat on the edge of it, watching him quietly for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently he was a stone mason in his free time? It must have been him who had laid the long driveway and patio in front of his house. The guy was full of surprises, one after the other. I couldn\u0027t help but notice the way his biceps flexed and strained as he lifted each stone and set it in its place. No wonder the guy was so cut. All he did was work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so I made a list,\" I said, eyeing him and scooting my butt higher on the large rock, making myself more comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher looked up at me, raising his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was using my voice to speak so that he could continue working without having to watch me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he sat up on his knees, putting his gloved hands on his muscular thighs, and looked at me. He was wearing a pair of faded workout shorts, knee pads, and work boots. His naked chest was tan and had a light sheen of sweat on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA list? He asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, leaving the list on my lap. Names. For the puppies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head to the side. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I said, feel free to veto, I mean, them being your dogs and all, but I thought Ivan Granite, Hawk Stravinski, and Oksana Hammer were top choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me. And then his face did something miraculous. It broke out into a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath hitched in my throat and I gaped at him. You like them? I finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I like them, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, a slow grin taking over my face. Well, okay then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there for just a little while longer, enjoying the summer sunshine and his presence while I watched him work–his strong body moving the stones around, placing them where he wanted them to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up at me a few times and gave me a small, shy smile. We didn\u0027t exchange many words after that, but the silence between us was comfortable, companionable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I stood up and said, \"I have to get going, Archer. My neighbor, Anne, has an appointment and I need to pick up Phoebe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher stood too, wiping his hands on his thighs and nodding. Thank you, he signed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and nodded and walked toward his gate. I rode home with a small, happy smile on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later I drove past Archer\u0027s house on my way back from lying on the small lake beach and his gate was slightly open again. A thrill shot down my spine as I got off my bike. I let myself in and I walked down his driveway, carrying Phoebe in my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on his door, but there was no answer and so I followed the sounds of the dog barks I heard coming from the direction of the lake. When I stepped through the trees, I spotted Archer and Kitty a little ways down the shore. I walked to meet him and when he spotted me, he gave me a small, shy smile and said, Hi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, squinting at him in the bright sunshine. I placed Phoebe down and said, Hey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked along the shore for a little bit in easy silence. The more time we spent together, even not speaking, the more comfortable I felt with him. I could sense that he was growing more comfortable with me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher picked a rock up off the beach and hucked it at the lake. It skipped across the lake again and again and again, barely eliciting any spray from the still water. I laughed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow me how you just did that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher watched my hands and then looked down at the sandy shore, searching for a stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found one he was happy with and handed it to me. The flatter, the better, he said. Now throw it sort of like a Frisbee, so that the flat side of it glances off the surface of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and lined up my shot. I threw it and watched as it skated over the surface once and then came up and hit the water again. I whooped and Archer smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up another small stone and hucked it at the lake. It hit the surface and skipped… and skipped… and skipped about twenty times. \"Show off,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at his amused face. You\u0027re good at everything you do, aren\u0027t you? I asked, cocking my head to the side and squinting at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked thoughtful for a few seconds before signing, Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute I asked, Your uncle homeschooled you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have been smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about that for a second. He was. Mostly with math and anything science-related. His mind would wander, but he taught me what I needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, remembering Anne telling me that Nathan Hale was always smart in school. Before I came out here, I asked about you in town, I said, feeling slightly shy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher looked over at me and frowned slightly. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head and considered that. After the first time we met… something drew me to you. I bit my lip. I wanted to know you. My cheeks heated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher stared at me for a second as if he was trying to figure something out. Then he picked up another flat stone and threw it at the water, making it skip so many times that my eyes lost it before it ever stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slowly. If they only knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned fully toward me. If who only knew what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in town. Some of them think you\u0027re not right in the head, you know. I laughed softly. It\u0027s laughable really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged again and picked up a stick and threw it to Kitty who was coming toward us on the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you let them think that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a breath and stared at the lake for a few seconds before turning to me. Just easier that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him and then sighed. I don\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s been this way for a long time, Bree, it\u0027s fine. It works for everyone involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t understand it exactly, but I could see the tense lines of his body as we talked about the town and so I backed off, wanting him to feel comfortable with me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what else can you teach me? I asked, teasingly, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised an eyebrow and looked into my eyes. My stomach clenched and a strange flock of butterflies took flight underneath my ribs. What can you teach me? he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slightly, tapping my pointer finger on my lips. I could probably teach you a thing or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah? What? His eyes flared very slightly, but then he looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"Um,\" I whispered, but then continued in sign so that he would have to look back at me. I used to be a really good cook. I wasn\u0027t sure why I said it. I didn\u0027t really have any intention of cooking for anyone, or teaching anyone to cook. But in that moment, it was the first thing that came to my mind, and I wanted to fill the strange awkwardness that had lapsed between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to teach me how to cook?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded my head very slowly. I mean, if that\u0027s not one of the many things you\u0027ve already mastered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. I still wasn\u0027t used to getting them, and this one made my heart speed up just a little bit. They were like a rare gift that he gave out. I snatched it up and stored it somewhere inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d like that, he said after a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, smiling, and he gifted me with another smile back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked along the lake shore for another hour, finding rocks and skipping them in the water until I could get mine to skip three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home later, I realized that I hadn\u0027t had such a good day for a really long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, I packed up some sandwiches at the diner, drove home, showered and changed, put Phoebe in the bike basket, and rode out to Archer\u0027s again. Despite the fact that I was the one showing up at his house and initiating our time together, I felt like he was putting in effort as well, just by allowing me to visit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Archer, I said, If your uncle didn\u0027t know sign language, how did you speak to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were on his lawn, Kitty and the pups lying on a blanket with us, the puppy\u0027s fat little bodies waddling around, getting lost in their blindness before their mama nuzzled them back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe was lying nearby too. She was mildly curious about the puppies, but didn\u0027t pay them much attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher looked up at me from where he was lying, his head propped up on his hand. He sat up slowly so that he could use his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t do much speaking. He shrugged. I wrote it down if it was important. Otherwise, I just listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regarded him silently for a minute, wishing I could see his expression better–but it was hidden under all the un-groomed hair. How did you learn sign language? I finally asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI taught myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head, taking a bite of the pastrami sandwich in my hand. Archer had polished his sandwich off in about thirty seconds flat, eating most of it, but sharing pieces of pastrami with Kitty. I put the sandwich down. How? From a book?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have a computer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at me, frowning slightly. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have electricity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me with amusement. Yes, I have electricity, Bree. Doesn\u0027t everyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose not to enlighten him to the fact that he kind of came off as someone who didn\u0027t necessarily have any modern conveniences. I tilted my head. Do you have a television? I asked after a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. No, I have books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, considering the man in front of me. And all these projects that you do–stonework, gardening–you just teach them to yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. Anyone can learn to do anything if they have the time. I have the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, picking a piece of meat out of the side of my sandwich and chewing it for a second before asking, How did you get all the stones for the driveway and the patio?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome I collected around the lake, some I bought in town at the garden shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how did you get them back here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carried them, he said, looking at me like it was a crazy question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you don\u0027t drive? I asked. You walk everywhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he answered, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, enough with the twenty questions, he said. What about you? What are you doing in Pelion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him for a second before answering, his golden brown eyes trained on me, waiting for what I was going to say. I\u0027m sort of on a road trip–I started, but then I stopped. No, you know what? I ran away, I said. My dad… passed away and… some other stuff happened that I had a hard time handling, and I freaked out and I ran away. I sighed. That\u0027s the truth of it. I\u0027m not sure why I just told you that, but that\u0027s the truth of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me for a little longer than I was comfortable with, feeling exposed, so I looked away. When I saw his hands move in my peripheral vision, I looked back at him. Is it working? He asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is what working?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning away, he said. Is it helping?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. Mostly, no, I finally answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, staring at me thoughtfully before looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad he didn\u0027t try to come up with something encouraging to say. Sometimes an understanding silence was better than a bunch of meaningless words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the immaculate yard, to the small house, compact but well kept. I wanted to ask him how he had the money to live out here, but I didn\u0027t think that was polite. He probably lived off of some insurance policy his uncle had left him… or maybe his parents. God, he had had so many losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Archer, I finally said, moving the conversation in another direction, that cooking lesson I mentioned… Are you free this Saturday? Your place. Five o\u0027clock? I raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled slightly. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll have to check with my social secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. You being funny?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled bigger. Thank you, I\u0027ve been working on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. His eyes twinkled and moved to my mouth. Those butterflies took flight again and we both looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a little bit, I gathered up my stuff and my little dog, said goodbye to Archer, and started walking up the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to the gate, I paused, looking back at the small house behind me. It suddenly occurred to me that Archer Hale had taught himself an entire language, but hadn\u0027t had a single person to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, as I was carrying a reuben with a side of fries to Cal Tremblay and a BLT with a side of potato salad to Stuart Purcell at table three, the bell rung over the door and I looked up to see Travis walking in wearing his uniform. He smiled big at me and gestured to the counter, asking if I was working it. I smiled and nodded, saying quietly, \"Be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI delivered the food in my hands, refilled their waters and then walked back behind the counter where Travis was now sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I greeted him, smiling. \"How are you?\" I held up the coffee pot and raised my brows questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" he said to the coffee and I started pouring. \"I\u0027ve been trying to call you,\" he said. \"Are you avoiding me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avoiding–oh crap! I ran out of minutes. Damn.\" I put my palm to my forehead. \"Sorry, I have one of those pay-as-you-go phones, and I rarely use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"Isn\u0027t there any family back home that you keep in touch with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"A few friends, but my dad passed away six months ago and… no, there\u0027s really not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, I\u0027m sorry, Bree,\" he said, concern filling his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved it away. I refused to get emotional at work. \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m okay.\" I was mostly okay, sometimes okay. Better these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me for a second. \"Well, the reason I was calling you was to see if you\u0027d like to do that dinner we talked about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my hip against the counter and smiled at him. \"So you tracked me down when I didn\u0027t answer my phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t exactly call it a high level, spy-caliber track down operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, but his wording reminded me of Archer and for some strange reason, something like guilt fluttered in my gut. What was that about? I had no idea. Our friendship was blossoming, but he was still closed off in many respects. I understood it I guessed, and it made me so mad that the whole dang town ignored him, when in fact, he was this incredibly smart, gentle man who as far as I could tell, had never done anything wrong to anyone. It wasn\u0027t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, earth to Bree,\" Travis said, snapping me out of my reverie. I had been staring out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slightly. \"I\u0027m sorry, Travis. I just got caught up in my own thoughts there for a minute. My brain can seriously be a black hole sometimes.\" I laughed softly, embarrassed. \"Anyway, uh, sure I\u0027ll go to dinner with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"Well, try not to sound too excited about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, shaking my head. \"No, sorry, I just… just dinner, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"I mean, maybe an appetizer… maybe even some dessert…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friday night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, okay.\" I held my finger up to a couple that had just sat down in my section and they smiled. \"I gotta get back to work, but see you Friday?\" I scribbled my address down on a piece of paper from my order pad and handed it to him, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, how about I pick you up at seven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect.\" I smiled again. \"See you then.\" As I walked around the counter to the table, I could see him leaning back on his stool to check out my ass as I walked away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-11.html","bookId":1846,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:56 PM"}
