{"id":42507,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX PREPARING TO RECEIVE GUY","content":"\u0026nbsp;Though he was puzzled by Guy’s letter, Mr. Fenwick was overjoyed at the thought of seeing his son again. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Why he should have arrived at New York on the Etruria, when he had been left by Captain Grover in Bombay, he could not understand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Probably Guy was too young for his position,” he thought, “and his employer has paid his expenses home. Never mind; he can find something to do here. It seems a long, long time since I have seen my dear boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the time he forgot the fact that he had no money with which to meet the mortgage; but it was brought back to his recollection when, later in the day, he met Deacon Crane in the village.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, parson,” began the deacon, abruptly, “I hope you haven’t forgotten that the mortgage falls due day after to-morrow. Have you secured the money to pay it?”{156}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, Deacon Crane. Money seems very hard to borrow just now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am aware of that. You will find it best to sell to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you offer?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A thousand dollars over and above the face of the mortgage.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But,” said the minister, dismayed, “that would make the place worth only fifteen hundred dollars!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Fifteen hundred dollars is a great deal of money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, I paid two thousand!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mebbe, mebbe; but property depreciates in the course of years.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly the land has not depreciated, and the house is in good repair.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, money is tight. You know that yourself, for you have found it hard to borrow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can’t you let matters run on for a year longer? By that time I may be able to realize a large sum for the property.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deacon Crane’s thin lips tightened, and his eyes looked crafty and forbidding.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What you ask is unreasonable, Brother Fenwick,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The minister looked despondent.{157}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I sell the house,” he said, “I don’t know where I can find another.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can board,” suggested the deacon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should not like it. I have been accustomed to have a home of my own. Besides—I didn’t think to tell you—I am expecting Guy home.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deacon Crane opened his eyes wide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, I thought he was in Bombay, earning his living. Why did he leave there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know. I got a letter this morning, saying that he had reached New York on the steamer Etruria.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deacon Crane’s puckered and wrinkled face looked jubilant. It might have been thought that he was pleased at the prospect of seeing Guy back; but this would have been a mistake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am not surprised,” he said, dryly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am. I did not dream of such a thing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course, it’s plain enough. Guy didn’t suit his employer, and he has been discharged.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope it isn’t that. But even that is better than his being sick.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I told you, parson, that it was very unwise to let so young a boy go off to the other end of the world. I know it wasn’t your fault, his staying behind in Bombay, but I should think a sensible man like Captain Grover would have advised against it.”{158}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall soon know what brings Guy back. I only mentioned it to explain that I should need a home for him as well as myself. It makes me all the more anxious to keep the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sure I have no objection if you can pay off the mortgage.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You couldn’t extend it for another year?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I couldn’t.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then perhaps you will take me as your tenant?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t think I could do that, either. I have other views.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ve got some news for you, Noah,” said Deacon Crane, when he entered his own house.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is it, father?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Guy Fenwick is coming back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When?” asked Noah, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “His father’s had a letter from New York, sayin’ that he’s just arrived by the Etruria.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, the Etruria comes from Liverpool, not from Bombay!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know that. He must have come by way of England.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ho! ho! Why, I thought he’d got a place in Bombay?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He’s probably been discharged and sent home.”{159}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’m glad of it!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you’ll be glad to have his company again?” said the deacon, slyly, for he knew just how his son felt toward Guy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, it isn’t that; but I’m glad he’s come home in disgrace. That boy was always puttin’ on airs, though his father was only a poor minister, and hadn’t half as much money as you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; nor one-fifth,” said the deacon, complacently. “I’ll tell you a secret, Noah. I’ve got a mortgage on the minister’s house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know that already.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But you didn’t know that I should probably have to foreclose the mortgage, and take the place. Of course, I shall get it cheap.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What are you going to do with it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps I shall keep it till you are married, Noah, and give it to you to live in,” said his father, playfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then Guy won’t have any home to go to?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That’s about it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wouldn’t be in his shoes. He’s lost his place, and now he will lose his home, too.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We mustn’t rejoice over his misfortune,” said the deacon, with the air of a Pecksniff. “We should always feel sorry for the bad luck of our fellow men.”{160}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you are, father, why do you foreclose the mortgage?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That’s business, Noah. We sometimes have to do in the way of business what we do not like to do. By the way, don’t mention to anyone what I intend to do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I won’t. But why doesn’t the minister pay off the mortgage?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For the very good reason that he cannot borrow the money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought perhaps Mr. Ainsworth would lend him. He seems to be a great friend of the minister.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It’s all Ainsworth can do to get the money to pay his own bills. The only man in the village that’s got any spare cash is——”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, who?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Deacon Crane,” answered Noah’s father, with a wintry smile; “and he isn’t lendin’.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ho! ho!” laughed Noah. “When is Guy Fenwick expected back?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shouldn’t wonder if he’d be here this afternoon, though the minister didn’t say. I don’t suppose there’s anything to keep him in New York.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is, if he’s got money enough to get home. It would be a joke if he had to walk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I guess he’ll have money enough to get home,{161} but I reckon it’ll be a good while before he gets a chance to go away again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ll be on the lookout for him,” said Noah. “I want to see how he looks, and what he’ll say when he finds his father is going to lose the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Fenwick had occasion to visit the village store during the day. Sometimes he went there without any errand, for he was always cordially received by Mr. Ainsworth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he entered, the storekeeper looked up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is this I hear about Guy returning, Mr. Fenwick?” he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I received a letter this morning stating that he had just reached New York by the steamer Etruria.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You didn’t expect him, did you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No. I supposed that he was still at Bombay.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your special friend, Deacon Crane, seems to be pleased to think he is coming back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He thinks Guy has been discharged by the merchant who employed him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course, it is possible that he did not give satisfaction.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know how that may be, but I shall be glad to have my boy at home again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you formed any views for him?”{162}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose it will be well to let him go into some store or counting-room. He doesn’t seem to care to go to college.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you see fit to let him enter my store, Mr. Fenwick, I shall be glad to receive him. I always liked Guy, and I consider him a smart boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, Mr. Ainsworth. You are always kind to me and mine. I can’t decide till I have seen Guy, but I think it quite possible that we shall accept your offer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was not the only opening for Guy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deacon Crane offered to give him work on his farm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I feel for your disappointment about the boy, parson,” he said, “and I think I can set him to work on my place. Of course, I can’t pay him much.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, Deacon Crane. I will see what Guy thinks about your offer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Fenwick knew, though he did not say so, that nothing would induce Guy to enter the deacon’s service.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82134.html","bookId":344,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:03:47 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:03:47 AM"}
