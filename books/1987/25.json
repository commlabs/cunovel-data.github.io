Everything seemed empty. I’d thought going to see Eva and telling her I loved her would do something. Low had got me to believe someone like Eva could love me. She was wrong. Eva had chosen her family over me, again. She always would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Smile, you’re depressing as shit,” Rock grumbled as he slammed a beer down in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never thought I’d see you with a broken heart. Out of all of the guys I never thought it’d be you. It’s like I’ve walked into the fucking twilight zone and can’t get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grunted and took a long swallow of my beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna dance, Cage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even try to remember her name. She was one of the mistakes. I had so many. I just shook my head no and took another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry honey but he ain’t real good company right now,” Trisha apologized for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you change your mind—“ she started\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t,” I interrupted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got the hint and walked off. I never even looked at her face. They all looked the same anyway. They all weren’t Eva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think maybe you could be less scary?” Trisha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock chuckled, “Let it go, babe. He’s nursing a broken heart and you know that boy ain’t ever had one before. It’s a new experience for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may want to warn Krit before they take a break. I don’t want Cage and him getting into it because he can’t keep his mouth shut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t belong here. I didn’t want to be here. I laid a couple twenties on the table and stood up. “I’m leaving, anyway. I’ve had all the fun I can handle for the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate for you to be alone. You want me to call Low?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow was the last person I wanted to talk to. She didn’t understand that it wasn’t an easy fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I just want to go home and go to bed. I need to be at the gym in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later,” Rock added with a nod and I turned and headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed that Jackdown had stopped playing and the crowd had gone silent. That was odd and unheard of. I paused and looked back at the stage to see what it was I was missing that had quieted the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” Eva’s voice said over the microphone. What the fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t, uh, I don’t normally play in front of people. Actually, I’ve never really played in front of people other than my family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began walking toward the sound of her voice. I pushed through the crowd and kept my eyes focused on the stage until I was close enough to see her. She stood in the spotlight with her hair pulled back in a ponytail and her guitar across her chest. Those blue eyes that had stopped my heart the first time she looked at me found me in the crowd. A small smile touched her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I have this song that I wrote for this amazing guy who completely changed my life and I need him to hear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to play and sing in front of a bar full of people. I took another step toward her and she began to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t want to see you but you invaded my world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery dark corner you found a way in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBringing color to the lifeless and lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to touch you but you reached inside me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery lost memory you found a way to melt the frost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the small closed world inside opened up into the sea\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou made me love you by the smile on your face, the kindness in your eyes and the heat of your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne kiss makes all that’s been hurt fade away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou made me love you for the man inside. The one no one sees but me. The man who listens to what my heart has to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to love you but you’re impossible not to love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery perfect moment I spend in your arms draws me closer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShowing me that life isn’t over because its path takes a sudden turn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t see you coming when you arrived\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing prepared me for the gift of a second chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been loved in life but all that matters now is that I’m loved by you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou made me love you by the smile on your face, the kindness in your eyes and the heat of your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne kiss makes all that’s been hurt fade away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou made me love you for the man inside. The one no one sees but me. The man who listens to what my heart has to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll spend eternity in your arms if you’ll trust me when I say that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar of the crowd dwindled away as I jumped up on the stage and pulled her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage picked me up and carried me off the stage while the crowd cheered and shouted all kinds of suggestions at him. He kept walking until he got to a backdoor. He opened it and pushed me into a room that looked like a dressing room. Red velvet couches and large mirrors lined the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing the door behind him he clicked the lock. Then he spun me around and pressed me up against the door. His mouth covered mine in a hungry growl and I wrapped my legs around his waist and grabbed onto his thick corded arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth pressed hungrily against mine as he tasted me thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he had me panting for breath he broke the kiss and buried his head in the curve of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fucking love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled. That was a very Cage response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do. I swear it. I should have never left. I was scared. I was stupid. I will make it up to you for the rest of our lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I get to decide the ways you can make it up to me?” I teased and I could feel his mouth smile against my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as it’s naughty,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my hands through his hair and down his arms as we stood there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You played for me,” he said, lifting his head so he could look into my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was amazing.” He pressed a kiss to my jawline. “Will you sing it for me again sometime?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I replied, unable to keep from laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like this skirt,” he whispered as his hands slid up my thighs and cupped my panty-covered bottom. “I like it a lot.” His hands slid into my panties. When his finger slid inside me I cried out and he covered my mouth with his. I kissed him back with all the need and desire rolling through me. I began grabbing at his shirt as we kissed frantically. Cage let me slide down his body and stand up so I could pull his shirt off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slung it on the floor and my mouth covered his nipple causing him to moan. “Fuck, I’m getting the other one done tomorrow,” he swore. The idea of it made me a little crazier. I’d been replaying how incredible sex was with Cage every night in bed. Now I had him here and he was all mine. I dropped to my knees to begin unfastening his jeans and then jerked them down. He reached for me and picked me up pushing me back against the door. He reached under my skirt, ripped my panties off and threw them aside. My shirt went next and his mouth covered my nipple as he lifted me up against the door and slid inside me with one swift thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried out and Cage kissed me hard and thrust his tongue into my mouth the same way he was thrusting into me. Pulling back he stared down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuuuuuck,” he groaned and I lifted my hips to press him in harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy baby,” he said through clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Cage I want it hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flashed bright blue. He pumped into me hard and I cried out encouraging him. Each moan of pleasure made him a little wilder. I wanted him wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ohgod, Eva,” he groaned and pumped faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, YES.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, fuck baby,” he cried out and began pounding into me causing the door behind us to rattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Harder, Cage. Harder,” I begged,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“AHHHH!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur bodies grew sweaty and our frenzied need for release took over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us cared about the fact we weren’t muffling our sounds. We just needed release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“SHIT! I don’t have on a condom,” Cage growled as he tensed underneath me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t care, don’t stop,” I panted desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure?” he asked as his body trembled under my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please GOD just don’t stop,” I cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage let out a roar and began pumping into me again which sent me spiraling off into bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cry of pleasure followed mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to catch my breath and a smile tugged at my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taking the bad boy off the market for good. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/while-it-lasts-sea-breeze-3/page-25.html","bookId":1987,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:23 AM"}
