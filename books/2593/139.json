This one remains nameless to me and she sits on the couch in the living room of my apartment. A bottle of champagne, Cristal, half empty, sits on the glass table. I punch in tunes, numbers that light up the Wurlitzer. She finally asks, \"What\u0027s that... smell in here?\" and I answer, under my breath, \"A dead... rat,\" and then I\u0027m opening the windows, the sliding glass door that leads out to the terrace, even though it\u0027s a chilly night, mid-autumn, and she\u0027s dressed scantily, but she has another glass of the Cristal and it seems to warm her enough so that she is able to ask me what I do for a living. I tell her that I went to Harvard then started working on Wall Street, at Pierce \u0026amp; Pierce, after I graduated from business school there, and when she asks, either confused or jokingly, \"What\u0027s that?\" I swallow and with my back to her, straightening the new Onica, find the strength to force out, \"A... shoe store.\" I did a line of cocaine I found in my medicine cabinet when we first came back to my place, and the Cristal takes the edge off it, but only slightly: The Patty Winters Show this morning was about a machine that lets people talk to the dead. This girl is wearing a wool barathea jacket and skirt, a silk georgette blouse, agate and ivory earrings by Stephen Dweck, a silk jacquard torsolette vest, all from... where? Charivari, I\u0027m guessing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-139.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
