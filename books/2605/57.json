In the blue, uncertain light of the tiny flashlight Deanna didn\u0027t look half bad. Even if she was undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you,\" she said, very softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee,\" she sighed. \"Dee. You can\u0027t be. You didn\u0027t-you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t kill myself?\" Deanna asked. Her voice had that growling quality they got. Her skin was the color of skim milk. She could probably tie a steel bar in knots with her bare hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was Deanna, alive again. Or almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I broke that window with my own hands. I cut myself up.\" Deanna\u0027s eyes wandered upward to Caxton\u0027s. \"I guess that counts,\" Deanna said. Under the growl there was a breathy quality to the voice. A sexy kind of flutter. It made Caxton\u0027s skin itch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be technically incorrect to say that Caxton thought Deanna was actually alive. She knew better than that. Or rather, her brain knew better. Her body had its own ideas and its own memories. It remembered the shape of Deanna, the shape of Deanna when she was alive. It remembered her smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you do this to us? You know what I am. What I\u0027ve been working on,\" Caxton said. She stepped closer and touched Deanna\u0027s strangely lumpy jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so cold,\" she said. She leaned forward and touched her forehead to the vampire\u0027s forehead. They used to do that, when they were alone, and things were quiet. They used to press up against each other. It felt pretty much the same this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t have a choice. I mean-except I did. Congreve.\" The vampire closed her eyes and pressed her hands against her toothy mouth. She shook with weeping. Caxton couldn\u0027t stand to see it. \"Shh,\" she said. \"Shh.\" She put her arms around Deanna\u0027s slender form. She wanted to press her tight until she warmed up again. Until she was a real girl again. A sob died in the middle of Caxton\u0027s throat. It didn\u0027t make it up to the surface. \"How do you know about Congreve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna pushed Caxton away. She used just enough of her strength to get out of the embrace, but underneath Caxton could feel just how much more power Deanna had if she chose to use it. It was like being shoved gently away by a pickup truck. Deanna wouldn\u0027t hurt Caxton, though. She would never harm her lover. Caxton could feel it in the way Deanna touched her, in the way they moved around each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to let us be together forever. That wasn\u0027t possible otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaxton shook her head. \"Forever. Sure. Forever like one of them. Have you seen Malvern?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna laughed and it almost sounded like her old laugh. \"Of course I have. She called me here.\" She was gone then, away from Caxton\u0027s body and that felt wrong. Deanna sat down on one of the bedframes and hugged herself. Caxton kneeled down to bring their faces closer together. \"Justinia is the one who made this possible. I was going to die, Pumpkin. I was going to die and I didn\u0027t know how else to save myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" Caxton said, and she reached with her thumbs to dry Deanna\u0027s tears. What leaked from the corners of the vampire\u0027s eyes wasn\u0027t water, though, but dark blood. Caxton wiped her fingers on her pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027d better tell me how this happened,\" Caxton said. Yes. That was good. She had to start thinking like a cop again. But it was so hard with Deanna right there, a Deanna who still moved and spoke and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congreve was going to kill me. It wasn\u0027t anything personal. He was just in the neighborhood, hunting and he found me. He came to the house one night when you were out at work. The dogs started singing and the light in the shed went on. I went to see what was happening. I grabbed the long screwdriver from the toolkit and I went back there and I said, \u0027Whoever\u0027s in there, you\u0027d better fuck off out of here. My girlfriend\u0027s a cop.\u0027 But nothing happened. So I went to the door of the shed and that\u0027s when he grabbed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congreve?\" Caxton asked. But how was that possible? She and Arkeley had killed Congreve long before Deanna\u0027s accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. His hands were really rough with calluses and they held me so tight. He told me I was going to die and I started screaming and begging. He told me to shut up and I tried. I really tried. He asked me if I was the artist, if the blankets in the shed were mine and I said no, because I thought maybe he was some crazy religious guy or something and he wanted to kill me for my art. He made me look into his eyes then and I saw he wasn\u0027t human at all. I couldn\u0027t lie to him then, not even if I wanted to. I said yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" Caxton moaned. \"He hypnotized you. He transmitted the curse to you and you couldn\u0027t even know what was happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna shrugged. \"I don\u0027t like to think of it that way. He was an artist too, he said. A musician. He really got my work, Laura. That has to count for something, right? He said talent like mine shouldn\u0027t be wasted. He asked me if I wanted to live or die. Just like that. You know, I actually had to think about it.\" Deanna looked down at her hands. She picked at the front of the dress. Caxton realized, suddenly, where she\u0027d seen it before. It was the Best Person dress that Deanna had worn to her brother\u0027s wedding. Had the Purfleets buried her in it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He made you like him. You must have said you wanted to live,\" Caxton said, trying to get back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna nodded. \"Then he went away. And I started having those dreams. The dreams about you bleeding to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaxton crab-walked backwards and sat down on a bedframe so she could face Deanna. They were two women, two living women sitting on beds, their knees almost touching. Two women just having a conversation. That was all, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna lowered her face until her voice was muffled by her folded arms. \"I fought the curse, as much as I could. I tried not to sleep. It\u0027s in your dreams that they make you hurt yourself. But that\u0027s the merciful part, isn\u0027t it? You don\u0027t feel a thing as long as you\u0027re dreaming. I wish I\u0027d known what it was going to be like so I wouldn\u0027t have been so afraid. I\u0027m really sorry, Laura. I\u0027m sorry I got so scared. Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t have told them about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Caxton asked, trying to keep her voice gentle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them I couldn\u0027t do it alone. I couldn\u0027t be one of them if because it would mean leaving you behind. Mr. Reyes said he had the answer for that, though. He said they could take both of us. He really seemed to like the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it hadn\u0027t happened like that. It couldn\u0027t have. Caxton felt like she\u0027d gotten to the end of a jigsaw puzzle and found the picture didn\u0027t match the cover of the box. She shook her head. \"That doesn\u0027t make sense, Deanna. Your story is all mixed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" the vampire asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This-this case-was all about me, at least, it was about me first. Because I stopped the half-dead at my sobriety checkpoint. That was how Reyes found out about me.\" That was the one thing she actually knew for sure, the one clue she\u0027d really had firm and solid in her mind the whole time. It was why Arkeley had drafted her into his crusade in the first place. It was why the half-dead had followed her home. Because the vampires wanted her as one of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pumpkin,\" Deanna said, rising to her feet. Caxton followed. \"Does it really matter who did what first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does.\" It meant everything. The vampires had come after her. They\u0027d been obsessed with her. \"This all began on the night of my sobriety check. When the half-dead followed me home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna shook her bald head, just a little. \"No, Laura, no. It started weeks before that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit,\" Caxton huffed. She wrapped her arms around herself. \"Anyway, how could you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, stop already. You\u0027re not this stupid!\" Deanna stood up and Caxton followed, but it felt as if she got to her feet first. Deanna was still rising. Eventually she raised herself up to a considerable height. Had she grown after being dead? Or maybe her posture was just better. \"That half-dead didn\u0027t just accidentally run across your sobriety check. He was coming to get you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" No, no, no, she thought. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Deanna reached out and grabbed Caxton\u0027s shoulders. Hard enough to pinch. Maybe even to hurt a little. She really wanted to convince Caxton that she was telling the truth. \"Congreve sent him to find you, and bring you to him, so you and I could do this together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Caxton said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Because I was scared to do it alone. And because Reyes wanted a matching pair of us. I was so confused when you woke me up that night as if nothing had happened. Then you scared away the half-dead. The one assigned to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Caxton thought, but she couldn\u0027t say it. If she said it she thought it might come out as a yes. Because she saw it could be exactly as Deanna said. It could be. But it wasn\u0027t. Because if it was, if Deanna had been cursed that whole time and Caxton hadn\u0027t even noticed, if she\u0027d failed Deanna that badly-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This whole thing, all the pain and suffering, was about me. And if you had just tried to talk to me, if you had just stayed with me that night I hurt myself-we could have been-we could have done it together-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Caxton shrieked. She just wanted it to stop. She wanted it all to stop. She pulled out the Glock 23 and fired her last three rounds into Deanna\u0027s chest, one two three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise obliterated all words. If only for an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Caxton looked down at what she\u0027d done. The white silk dress was scorched and torn but the skin underneath wasn\u0027t even singed. Deanna was completely unhurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god-you\u0027ve fed tonight,\" Caxton wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my girlfriend. You\u0027re supposed to want to be with me forever, no matter what! We\u0027re supposed to want the same things. Why is this so hard for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fingers on Caxton\u0027s shoulder compressed like an industrial vise. Caxton could hear the bones in her shoulder creak and start to pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you love me anymore?\" Deanna demanded. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-57.html","bookId":2605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:42 PM"}
