{"id":96345,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eAfter school, Ivy, Abby, and I left the suburbs for the more rural side of Legend\u0027s Run. Farms, lakes, and vineyards filled the landscape. I always thought the Westside had more character. However, Ivy and Abby were only interested in the strip and indoor malls, restaurants, and fast food in the burbs. Even the yuppies didn\u0027t stop in Riverside but rather pedaled through it on the bike trail on weekend outings. As the years passed, I had no reason to venture there on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we came into Riverside, antiques shops, used car lots, and neighborhoods without homeowners associations lined the terrain. The businesses had left for the suburbs, and the downtown wasn\u0027t as viable as it once was. However, a small town remained, including a hardware store, bars, flea and farmers\u0027 markets, a biker bar, and Gerald\u0027s Garage\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;where Gerald still pumped the gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not run out of gas!\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like we\u0027re on the other side of the earth,\" I said. \"We could walk back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy? Walk?\" Abby asked, horrified. This comment was coming from the jayvee champion track star. I guess it just mattered where she walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake said it\u0027s dangerous down by Riverside. So far, it doesn\u0027t look that bad to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s beautiful,\" I said, gazing into a wooded area. \"All these trees and hills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where do people who live here shop?\" Ivy asked. \"I haven\u0027t seen a mall for miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Abby said. \"And where is a community pool? There aren\u0027t even any health clubs here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you don\u0027t need a treadmill if you are plowing a field.\" Ivy laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have cars, just like us,\" I defended. \"If they want to go to a mall, they drive just like we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued on and passed a wooded area that ran along the road for about half a mile. Then we came into the small downtown area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the tiny main street many shops were vacant, but the ones that remained\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a tattoo and piercing parlor, a hair salon, and a florist\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;seemed to be thriving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could get a tat,\" Abby said. \"I think a tramp stamp would be really cool. Dylan would love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one is coming at me with a needle,\" Ivy said. \"Not even for a guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined the tattoos my friends would have: Ivy\u0027s would be a designer label drawn on her arm, and Abby might have one of a volleyball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy parked her car at the meter in front of Penny for Your Thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have change,\" Ivy said. Ivy was used to paying for things with plastic. I don\u0027t even think she owned a coin purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much should I put in?\" Abby asked, rummaging through her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how long it takes to get a reading. I\u0027ve never done it before,\" Ivy said. \"Is it longer than a massage or a pedi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged my shoulders. I\u0027d had a pedicure several years ago for my sister\u0027s graduation. I was so relaxed and zoned out I forgot how long it took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fished some change out of my hoodie pocket and fed the meter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny for Your Thoughts was quite the curiosity shop. Candles, crystals, jewelry, books, and the smell of incense filled the one-room store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI examined books on healing, numerology, astrology, angels, and interpreting dreams. There were so many different paranormal ideas, I wasn\u0027t sure how a person decided which one to believe in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did like the mood of the shop. It was very calm and relaxing. Soothing mandolin, harp, and flute music played over the sound of a roaring ocean. The store was a nice change of pace from our frenetic high school, with lockers slamming and students yelling across the hallway. I was just hoping I could stay awake long enough to get my fortune told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t anyone run this place?\" Abby asked. She got irritated if she wasn\u0027t immediately greeted like a VIP upon entering a store or restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she was truly psychic, wouldn\u0027t she know we were here?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she does and doesn\u0027t want to talk to us,\" Abby said pensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was suspicious. Maybe Dr. Meadows wasn\u0027t going to come out right away so she could overhear our discussions. Or maybe she was watching us on a hidden camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby perused books on witches, and Ivy headed straight for the jewelry displays. Any gift shop was a potential sale to her. She was sizing up some aquamarine earrings that matched her eyes. I thought they were beautiful, and if I had more money, I, too, would have loved a pair. I caressed the glassy stones, trying to figure out how long it would take for me to buy them. Ivy didn\u0027t even bat an eyelash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why we are here,\" Abby said, taking the earrings from Ivy and returning them to the jewelry stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby rapidly tapped a bell on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she\u0027s back there casting a spell or something,\" she said. \"Or making potions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one came out to wait on us. We were certain the store was open but not sure how long we should stay. My friends were often impatient\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but not this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can leave,\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without my receipt,\" Abby said. \"If you think I\u0027m going to be Dylan\u0027s servant for a week... I can only imagine the horrors he\u0027ll ask of me. Clean his locker? Forget it. Besides, I\u0027ve been thinking all day of things I can have him do. I really could use a back massage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Jake can return those skirts I bought at the mall,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered what I\u0027d ask Nash to do as my servant. Carry my books? My backpack worked fine. Do my homework? I wasn\u0027t a cheater. Clean my room? He never came over. Then it occurred to me. The one thing that would really make Nash squirm. I\u0027d have him host a party and make him invite a Westsider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" I said. \"We need to get those receipts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I tapped the bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman appeared, startling all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry to keep you girls waiting. I hope you had a chance to look around. What brings you in today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Dr. Meadows?\" Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, have you heard of me?\" she asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows\u0027s appearance wasn\u0027t that of a typical doctor. She didn\u0027t wear a lab coat or scrubs. She also didn\u0027t look like a witch doctor. She did, however, have long gray hair tied back in a ponytail, and she wore an oversized silk blouse, a floor-length scrunchie skirt, and layered beaded necklaces. I guessed she was in her fifties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows had a gentle energy around her. Not that I was an aura reader, but I imagined hers to be a mixture of warm and bright hues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like our fortunes told,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean an interpretive reading?\" she asked as if fortune-telling was so \"yesterday.\" \"Have you had one before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I figured she should already know this, but I just shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows turned the sign hanging on the door from OPEN to CLOSED.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t have any distractions,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s go into the reading room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reading room was painted indigo blue, with a hanging teardrop chandelier. There was a square table with chairs on each end. In the corner were a small waterfall and a tea service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d have a spooky room with a crystal ball,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t admit it to Dr. Meadows, but I was surprised, too. Though I didn\u0027t subscribe to her New Age philosophy, I certainly respected that this was her establishment, not ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go first,\" I offered. I just wanted to get this over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I will,\" Abby bulldozed, and scooted into the chair before I could land on it. Ivy and I took the empty chairs by the tea service and observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows took Abby\u0027s hand and matched her gaze. Then the doctor closed her purple-painted eyelids. I imagined she was planning her dinner menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a very spirited girl,\" she began. \"That is good. It will take you far. But you can relax. It is okay to slow down. You have your whole life ahead of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she\u0027s good,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t impressed. Just by looking at Abby, a stranger could tell she was athletic and high-strung. And it wasn\u0027t much of a reading, I thought. Was she going to meet a handsome stranger? Was she going to win the grand prize on a reality show?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and Abby swapped chairs. Ivy\u0027s hand was ultrafeminine, as dainty as the porcelain teacup. Her perfectly manicured nails were without a hangnail or uneven polish like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worldly things are very important to you,\" Dr. Meadows said. \"But it is okay to find the things that matter most inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy was very pleased with her reading. It was as if Dr. Meadows had been a mentor to her all of her life. And all she did was feed her a line from any self-help book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows offered us tea. \"It\u0027s ginseng. Lots of antioxidants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and Abby pounced on the idea of having a few drinks. We hadn\u0027t stopped at a coffee shop and I knew they were suffering from latte withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have sugar?\" Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is supposed to be taken in its pure form,\" Dr. Meadows said, and poured two cups. Then she turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thank you,\" I politely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah... a skeptic,\" Dr. Meadows said. \"Always one in the room. Dragged here by your friends? It\u0027s okay,\" she offered again. \"I didn\u0027t put anything into the tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. I watched you, I wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and Abby were sipping from their teacups like we were dining with the queen of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows held my hand for a moment. She was dead silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see snow,\" she began. \"Beware of the woods... of the sounds of howling. There could be outsiders who will turn... underneath the glow of the full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChills raced up my arm and straight to the top of my neck. I tried to pull my hand away, but her grasp was too tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe struggled for a moment until finally she released her grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s time we go,\" I said, rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows still seemed to be in a trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to my friends, who reluctantly returned their teacups to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to go...\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" Dr. Meadows said, coming back to life. She sighed an exhausted sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI marched out of the room, and Ivy and Abby followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby grabbed a benign, humorous book on witchcraft for her essay and she and I placed our money on the counter when Dr. Meadows finally appeared. Ivy handed her a credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need three receipts, please,\" Abby requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows handed us our change and gave Ivy her receipt to sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you will come again,\" Dr. Meadows said, escorting us to the door. \"At least for some tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the best time we\u0027ve ever had!\" Abby squealed, giving Dr. Meadows a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming here for jewelry!\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, on the other hand, decided this would be my last trip to Penny for Your Thoughts. I would have gladly traded in my bogus reading for the stunning, luminous earrings, since they wound up being the same price. Now I knew why they called them \"fortunes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the door, Dr. Meadows had parting words for my friends. \"Thank you so much for coming,\" she said, giving each an embrace. \"You\u0027re such delightful girls. Remember what is inside of you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not just what is on the outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy beaming friends exited the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, Dr. Meadows turned to me and grasped my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste,\" she said vehemently. \"Beware of a kiss under the full moon. It will change your life forever.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-6.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
