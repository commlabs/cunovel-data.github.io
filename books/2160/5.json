{"id":97348,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eAliisza wasn\u0027t sure how Kaanyr would receive her latest news, but it didn\u0027t slow her steps. Tarrying to deliver it served no purpose. He would find out eventually, and she might as well pass it to him and get on to other, more interesting things. Besides, she wasn\u0027t really troubled by the prospect of the cambion\u0027s anger. He might fly off the handle from time to time, but he knew better than to direct it at her. Whether or not he flew into a rage this time, she had an idea that might just soothe his ruffled feathers and give her a bit of fun, besides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassing through the great doorway and into the throne room, Aliisza expected to find Vhok sitting on his throne, but he was not. He paced in front of it, which meant that he had serious things on his mind, serious in a bad way. The alu-fiend had a pretty good idea what those things were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any more information on what that duergar horde is doing?\" she asked as she approached him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVhok looked up from his contemplation, seemed to stare right through her for a moment, and at last said, \"All I\u0027ve been able to determine at the moment is that they don\u0027t seem to be headed in this direction, which is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good? Why?\" Aliisza asked. She moved to sit on the top step of the dais. \"I thought you liked the idea of a little sport for the Legions. You told me the other night that things were getting a bit staid around - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because something big is definitely going on,\" Kaanyr interrupted, \"and because they were responsible for wiping out the patrol to the northeast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza had been about to stretch out, hoping to distract Kaanyr from all of this serious discussion for a few moments of romance, but she sat straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t just a roving band of duergar,\" Vhok continued, \"they were professional mercenaries. The Xornbane clan, if the evidence is correct. They don\u0027t go anywhere without major coin changing hands and big battles in the works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza pursed her lips in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if they aren\u0027t moving against us,\" she said, \"then where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though I already have an idea, I was hoping you could tell me,\" Kaanyr said, looking down at the alu-fiend, \"Where are my guests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza avoided meeting Vhok\u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t able to convince them to join us,\" she said carefully, \"and after they defeated my little patrol as easily as they did, I thought it wise not to pursue the matter so directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Defeated? Wiped out is more like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaanyr\u0027s tone was measured, and Aliisza could tell he was displeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he already knew, did he? Is he spying on me, now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was glad she\u0027d been up front with him on the subject. It had been tempting to fudge the truth a bit, to tell him that the tanarukks had not followed her instructions, but in the end, something had convinced her that she was going to have to start being a little more careful with Vhok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are formidable,\" she answered at last. \"The wizard with them is ... interesting. He\u0027s the one I spoke with, and it was definitely he who plowed through the Legions. Drow are formidable to begin with, and it was a tactical error on my part to engage them in such a large chamber. They were able to easily evade the Scourged simply by getting up off the floor and out of range. Pharaun laid waste to the troops without much of a thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you did the best you could,\" Kaanyr said, waving her explanation away. Aliisza scowled at the insult but said nothing. \"It\u0027s probably just as well. It seems that the gray dwarves are bound and determined to reach Ched Nasad, which is where our little visitors are headed, as well, I think. We weren\u0027t going to dissuade them from that without bringing the entire might of the Scourged Legions, as well as some of your sisters, to bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did find out a couple more things,\" Aliisza said, ready to spring her idea on Vhok. \"They are all high-ranking nobles from Menzoberranzan, not just the priestess. The wizard is powerful enough to be a member, if not a master, of Sorcere, and some of the things he admitted to convinced me that most of the others are of similar rank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s all very interesting, but I probably would have inferred that from the fact that the Mistress of the Academy was out with such a small group to begin with. It still doesn\u0027t tell me what they\u0027re doing. It may help to answer the questions of why the grays are on the move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have an idea aboutthat,\" Aliisza said, reaching the moment of truth. She wondered if Kaanyr would agree with her plan or choose to use someone else. \"Whatever it is they\u0027re planning to do when they reach Ched Nasad, they all seem very concerned, very grim. Whatever it is, it\u0027s serious, and I bet they aren\u0027t the only drow in the city who are in the know about it. So why don\u0027t I sneak into Ched Nasad and snoop around a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaanyr looked at Aliisza, pursing his lips. She wasn\u0027t sure if he was thinking about her idea or just studying her to see if she was up to something. Of course she intended to do just what she said, so he had no reason not to trust her on it, but if she had a little fun on the side, well then, what would be the harm in that? She needed a vacation from Ammarindar, from Vhok. Maybe a little time apart would do him some good, too, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said at last, and the alu-fiend grinned broadly before she caught herself. \"Go and see what you can find out. In fact, I want you to drop in on Aunrae. If there\u0027s something going on, the matron mothers will be in the know. I\u0027d like to keep my relationship with her on good terms, at least for the moment, so be polite. And keep me updated. I don\u0027t want to have to come find you to see what you\u0027ve learned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza was nodding energetically as she stood up and headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" she promised, already contemplating the sort of disguise she\u0027d like to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Khorrl felt the wagon finally roll to a stop, he almost groaned aloud. His legs were cramping where he\u0027d wedged himself into the hiding spot beneath the pile of supplies. He could barely stand to be there much longer, and he prayed to Laduguer that the tripwas actually over. He couldn\u0027t imagine having to crouch there for even another few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tarp over the top of the wagon was thrown back, and dim light shone down on the goods stacked beneath it. Of course, to anyone not properly prepared, that\u0027s all they would have seen - a wagon-load of supplies for the city. Khorrl waited as he listened, not daring to move, in case it was merely another checkpoint. He didn\u0027t even want to breathe, for fear of being heard by whomever - or whatever - might be inspecting the wagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" he heard a drow voice say, and he recognized it as belonging to Zammzt. The dark elf was near enough that there was no mistaking who he was talking to. \"You can show yourselves, now. We\u0027re inside the storehouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thankful groan, Khorrl rose up, feeling his knees complaining. Around him, fourteen other duergar did the same, winking back into visibility one by one. They looked at each other, as if to confirm that everyone was all right, and began to peer around at their surroundings. Khorrl himself hopped awkwardly down from the wagon, grabbing his axe as he did so. Nearby, more wagons were being uncovered, and more of his fighters appeared, clambering out from between crates, barrels, and bales of foodstuffs. He knew that there were over twenty wagons, so he had about three hundred troops. More would arrive, in waves, over the course of the next several hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zammzt had promised, they were set up inside a large, open room, obviously a storehouse of some sort, though there were no goods there other than what was on the wagons. Ostensibly, the contents of the wagons were for the benefit of the Houses, but in reality, it was his army\u0027s supplies. They were going to be camping there for a few days, resting and preparing while the other duergar units arrived, all of them waiting until it was time to do their job. Khorrl hoped the storehouses would be left undisturbed, as promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA handful of drow moved about, uncovering wagons in order to free their hidden occupants or unloading the supplies and stacking them out of the way. Khorrl could see Zammzt looking a couple of wagons over, giving some young drow male a few instructions. When the dark elf was finished, he turned back to the duergar clan leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you find everything in order here, Captain Xornbane,\" Zammzt said, smiling. \"I know it\u0027s not quite like roughing it in the wilds of the Underdark, but it should accommodate you well enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine, as long as no one comes snooping around here before we\u0027re ready to begin. The last thing we need is the city catching wind of us before your mistress is ready to fly her true colors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl paced about as he spoke, trying to get the feeling back in his legs as much as surveying his temporary home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I seriously doubt that\u0027s going to be a problem,\" Zammzt said, smiling. Khorrl wanted to tell him to stop it. The grin reminded the duergar of a pack lizard\u0027s visage. \"I\u0027ve got loyal drow troops on guard duty around the storehouse, and you\u0027re sequestered here in the far back chamber. No one will bother you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so,\" Khorrl answered doubtfully. He had seen more battles take a turn for the worse through the most simple, straight-forward aspect of the plan going awry. \"Just remember, all that beautiful treasure you gave me is already long gone, shipped off to safer parts. If you\u0027re thinking of turning the tables, you won\u0027t be seeing it again. It\u0027ll be an expensive betrayal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZammzt looked genuinely hurt, but only for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure you realize the risks my mistress takes, simply harboring an army here,\" said the drow. \"If you\u0027re discovered, she too suffers the consequences. It really isn\u0027t in her best interests to turn on you, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" Khorrl answered. \"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I presume you brought everything you need,\" the drow said, changing the subject, \"but if there\u0027s anything else you want while you wait here, now is the time to ask. Though, for what we\u0027re paying you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl barked a deep laugh despite himself. The idea that he would bring his troops into such an uncertain situation without arranging for every provision, every possible contingency, was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we\u0027re fine. Now, when are we going to find out just exactly who we\u0027re supposed to be killing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon, my gray friend,\" Zammzt said, that toothy smile blossoming again. \"Very soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the battle with the tanarukks wasn\u0027t much of a fight at all. Pharaun had devastated rank upon rank of the slavering humanoids from a distance, even going so far as to decimate the reserve forces lurking in the back. He honestly didn\u0027t even find it sporting, especially when he was able to hover overhead, out of their reach, and attack them at his leisure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Menzoberranyr were well beyond the halls of Ammarindar, and after a night\u0027s rest they were closing in on Ched Nasad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should be running into patrols by now,\" Faeryl grumbled as they hiked along. \"We\u0027re within a quarter mile of the city. Something\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we knew that before we left Menzoberranzan,\" Quenthel snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group found itself on the main thoroughfare that led into the city from the north, wondering when they would actually reach the surrounding outskirts of the city proper, the area protected by patrols. Pharaun couldn\u0027t blame Faeryl for being apprehensive. Even after several tendays of concern for her home city, he imagined that she might have held out some hope that she would find everything in order upon finally arriving. Still, he doubted that some disaster had befallen the city. Though they hadn\u0027t yet encountered any patrols, they were no longer alone on the road to the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic flowing to and from Ched Nasad was a trickle of its normal self, at least according to the ambassador. Pharaun didn\u0027t doubt it. The avenue they followed was broad, wide enough for numerous caravans to pass in either direction, but there were no such convoys out and about that day. Most of those who shared the road with the Menzoberranyr were other drow, though the occasional gray dwarf, kobold, or goblin passed them as well. Those lesser beings gave the drow a wide berth. Any pedestrians who were headed toward the city were scattered just as far apart as those leaving, and Pharaun and his companions neither passed nor were passed by anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mage made a tactful attempt to bring up the suggestion he had been contemplating. \"Quenthel, if something has happened here, similar to what we\u0027ve been experiencing back home, it might be prudent to consider a less obvious entrance into the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" the high priestess queried, looking sharply atPharaun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only that should we boldly approach and announce our stature and intentions, we might not receive the warm welcome we should under more ordinary circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t they be glad to see us? Even relieved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded as though Quenthel was growing indignant, and Pharaun struggled to find a way to explain his point in a way that wouldn\u0027t sound insulting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaeryl saved him the effort. \"Because they might think we\u0027re here to spy on them,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun had to suppress a mild chuckle. It was, after all, the exact reason Triel had claimed when she imprisoned the envoy back in Menzoberranzan. It was a reasonable argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if we insist upon meeting with the matron mothers of the highest Houses - \" Quenthel began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With all due respect, Mistress,\" Faeryl interjected, \"do you think you would react well to a high-ranking noble arriving in Menzoberranzan and insisting upon seeing you? During this time of crisis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel scowled and said nothing. Pharaun was relieved that thehigh priestess was at least willing to contemplate the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if they didn\u0027t think we were spies, they certainly would consider our visit to be highly unusual and would strive to keep an eye on us,\" the mage said. \"We might be given the most luxurious accommodations and want for nothing, but we would also be absolutely unable to find out anything. Once we determine the state of things here, if it\u0027s really your intention to lay claim to the goods stored in the Black Claw Mercantile storehouses and take them back to Menzoberranzan, why draw undue attention to yourself? Were you planning to ask the matron mothers for them, first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel scowled at Pharaun as if the very idea of asking permission to take what was rightfully hers was preposterous. It was exactly the reaction he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faeryl,\" the wizard persisted, \"even though the goods are rightfully the property of House Baenre and House Melarn, do you foresee Matron Mother Melarn - indeed, any of the other Houses - letting them out of the city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaeryl smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m not certain how happy my own mother will be to hear about your plan.\" She smiled wanly and added, \"I agree with the mage. The less you tell, the better your chances are of succeeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your arguments may have merit,\" Quenthel said. \"So what else do you suggest? How do we enter unnoticed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As traders, Mistress,\" Faeryl suggested, \"members of the Black Claw Mercantile company. Triel said herself that we were here to check on House Baenre\u0027s financial interests, as well as to discover how widespread the problem is, so it\u0027s the truth, from a certain point of view.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t look very much like traders,\" Valas said, trotting a little in front of the rest of them. \"Perhaps Pharaun should use a spell of illusion to mask our looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Faeryl replied. \"Ched Nasad\u0027s guards are equipped to watch for that. They employ detection spells and devices to notice if you\u0027re trying sneak past them invisibly or under the guise of illusion. It\u0027s not necessary, anyway. You\u0027d be surprised at what kind of bodyguards a wealthy trader would hire to protect her. I am a member of a trading house. If I tell the city guards that you\u0027re escorting me, and they get a good look at my house insignia, we shouldn\u0027t have any trouble, but you must remove your own insignia. They\u0027re likely to be recognized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you hire the likes of him?\" Quenthel asked, pointing to Jeggred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaeryl frowned and said, \"He could be a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave that to me,\" Pharaun said, \"I have a couple of tricks up my sleeve that should aid us nicely. I can use them to get the draegloth past the patrols and into the city without them noticing him. As long as he cooperates, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel looked at Jeggred and asked, \"Can you stay quiet and not try to tear the throat out of anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred regarded the high priestess askance but nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am capable of subtlety when it is necessary, Mistress,\" he rumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure you are, Pharaun thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Quenthel said after a moment\u0027s deliberation, \"We will enter the city incognito. Remove your insignia and try to look . . . common.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone except Faeryl doffed their House brooches and began to stow as many of their finer accoutrements as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pharaun,\" Quenthel said, nodding at Jeggred, \"do what you must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, I\u0027m going to reduce you slightly in size, so that you aren\u0027t so, um . . . obvious,\" the wizard said, looking up at the eight-foot-tallcreature. \"You don\u0027t mind, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred grunted and glowered at the mage, but at a subtle gesture from Quenthel, he nodded acquiescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Pharaun continued. \"Then, I\u0027ll cloak you with a spell designed to misdirect those divinations the patrols are likely to be using, and if you will don yourpiwafwi, pull the hood up, and stay in the back, we should get past them just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that should do nicely,\" Faeryl agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then, here we go,\" Pharaun said, pulling a pinch of powdered iron from one of his many pockets and gesturing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draegloth began to shrink until he was no taller than any of the draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" the wizard said, beginning the second spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was finished, he stepped back and said, \"Now, draw thatpiwafwi around you to hide as much of you as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and lean on Ryld as though you\u0027re injured,\" Quenthel commanded. \"Keep your head down like you\u0027re tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, good idea,\" Pharaun agreed, genuinely impressed. \"We\u0027re all just road-weary merchants, ready for a hot bath and comfortable bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a moment too soon,\" Valas said, his voice low. \"I see a patrol up ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun peered ahead into the distance and saw a large contingent of drow, some on foot, others riding lizards, moving down the road in their direction. They were fanned out across the width of the road, so there would be no way to avoid them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just remain calm, and allow me to speak to them,\" Faeryl whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group began walking toward the patrol, with Ryld in the back, pretending to support a limping Jeggred. Pharaun could only guess at how much the warrior hated the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter, he thought. We should have little difficulty getting past these sentries. We\u0027re just drow, trying to reach a drow city. Why would we be any trouble to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the groups drew close to one another, the patrol loosened weapons and slowed down, obviously preparing for trouble. One, the leader, Pharaun presumed, stepped forward a few more paces and held his hand outstretched before him, palm forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold,\" he said, gesturing for the group to slow down. \"State your name and business here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaeryl moved forward, past Valas, to come to a stop a few paces from the leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Faeryl Zauvirr of House Zauvirr, Executive Negotiator for the Black Claw Mercantile.\" She removed her insignia and held it out for the patrol leader to get a good look and take it, if he wanted. \"These are my caravan guards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant or whatever he was stepped forward and took the insignia, then passed it back to an underling while he scrutinized Faeryl and the others, in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caravan? What caravan? No goods have entered or left the city in six tendays, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaeryl nodded and explained, \"Yes, I know. We are just recently from Menzoberranzan, but we lost what few goods we had in an attack along the way.\" She tossed her head back toward Ryld and Jeggred as a way of indicating her wounded companions, but with the suggestion that they weren\u0027t really important. The drow soldier in front of her peered over her shoulder for a brief moment, then nodded and returned his attention to her. \"We wish to give our report and enjoy some civilization for a few days,\" she concluded, letting weariness creep into her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood, Pharaun thought. Tell them just enough of the truth to sound reasonable, without admitting anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attacked by what?\" the leader asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second-in-command handed the insignia back to him with a curt nod. Apparently it had passed muster, for the patrolman handed it back to Faeryl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What business is it of yours?\" asked Quenthel sourly. \"Do you always make it a practice of interrogating caravans this way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tanarukks,\" Pharaun said, stepping forward and placing his hand on Quenthel\u0027s arm. \"She hates tanarukks. She\u0027s been in a bad mood ever since. A good deepstroke will do her wonders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master of Sorcere could feel her bristle, but at least she didn\u0027t pullaway from him. Beside her, the snakes of her whip stirred, but they didn\u0027t flail about as Pharaun feared they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patrol leader glaredat Quenthel for a moment but finally nodded and said, \"We make it a practice when the city is - \" he stopped himself from revealing more, then turned back to Faeryl -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"You may pass, but good luck finding any \u0027civilization\u0027 to enjoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that last bitter comment, he turned and motioned the rest of the patrol to part, creating a gap so that the entourage could pass through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaeryl nodded her thanks and motioned for the rest of them to follow her, then they were past the patrol and alone on the thoroughfare once again. Pharaun could see that the envoy was troubled by the patrol leader\u0027s words. He had to admit it was not a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me!\" Quenthel hissed, jerking her arm free, and the wizard blinked in surprise, having forgotten that he still grasped her and was steering her along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My apologies, Mistress,\" Pharaun said, bowing slightly. \"In light of the situation, I thought it prudent to try to smooth things over the best way possible. In a way, though, it was good. You drew attention away from the draegloth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she answered, still scowling. \"We got through them, that\u0027s the important thing. Now, let\u0027s see just how bad it is inside the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t long before the group had reached the gates of the City of Shimmering Webs. Continuing their masquerade as bruised and battered merchants, they passed through the guards there and found themselves inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was chaos. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-5.html","bookId":2160,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:53 PM"}
