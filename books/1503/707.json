Riding such a carriage would not disturb their cultivation. Zhou Weiqing had always felt that he was not far from breaking through into the thirty seventh stage of Saint Energy and naturally would not waste this opportunity to cultivate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the protection of Er Chun and the others, once they left W’Batu City, they headed straight for the central plains of XuanTian Continent. According to Er Chun, they would reach the Heavenly City in an estimated 15 days at the fastest and 20 at the slowest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the way, Er Chun’s care for the young couple could be said to be extremely meticulous. Various delicies of the XuanTian Continent were endlessly sent into the carriage that they were more than happy to enjoy. Besides savouring their meals and indulging in the scenery, the rest of their time was spent cultivating. This trip was really several times better than their journey through the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the sake of escorting Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er to their destination as quickly as possible, the group seldom stayed in inns. Most of their time was spent on the road and new mounts would be exchanged at every relay station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, this was not considered tough on them at all. Although it was slightly harder on the Heavenly Jewel Masters who were in charge of protecting them, they were able to push through by relying on their cultivation foundations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached their destination in only fourteen days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, we are about to enter Heaven City.” Er Chun’s voice was transmitted from outside the carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noted,” Zhou Weiqing responded. He lifted the window curtains of the carriage and looked outside. He could already see the silhouette of a city in the distance. Compared to ZhongTian City, this Heavenly City was much smaller. Furthermore, it was not as bizarre as Heavenly Jewel Island. However, compared to most of the other cities he had visited, the Heavenly City was indeed still considered a large city and its scale was approximately equal to Fei Li City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had been rather depressed over the past few days. He had already felt that his Saint Energy was about to breakthrough when they reached the XuanTian Continent. Yet he was still stuck in a bottleneck after training for the past few days, and there was ultimately no breakthrough. Currently, he even started to reminisce the initial days of training the Immortal Deity Technique. Although breakthroughs were excruciatingly painful, the entire process was rather swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even after he had dedicated his efforts into cultivation for such a long time, he was still unable to advance to the next stage. More importantly, he still did not have a cultivation technique for his Saint Energy, and thus did not know how he should actually undergo that breakthrough. The only thing he could do was slowly accumulate power. It was only the first layer of Saint Energy after the nine-Jeweled Stage, and yet breakthrough was already so difficult. This naturally led him to think of how challenging it would be to condense a Saint Nucleus Core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, even if he was depressed, there was nothing else he could do. Shangguan Bing’er had also consoled him several times. After all, he was already at the nine-Jeweled stage. For any Heavenly Jewel Master, it was natural that progress after this level would definitely slow down. Why else would there be less Heavenly King Stage and above practitioners when compared to nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEr Chun rode over on his horse and said to Zhou Weiqing, “Lord God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, should we head straight to our XuanTian Palace or find a place to stay first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing took a look at him and replied, “Why head directly to XuanTian Palace? We have not even participated in the selection finals, won’t it be bad to break the rules?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEr Chun cursed to himself. \u003cem\u003eYou are a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, why is there a need to participate in the selection?\u003c/em\u003e However, he did not dare to go against Zhou Weiqing. In any case, they had already arrived at Heavenly City and his mission was mostly completed. Hence, he could only nod his head in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter entering Heavenly City and finding a rather luxurious inn to stay at, Er Chun did not dare to rest. He assigned his subordinates to protect the Zhou Weiqing duo in the inn while he headed directly to XuanTian Palace to report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe luxurious room was two hundred square metres in area, and the various facilities within could be described as lavish. Zhou Weiqing leaned against the soft genuine leather sofa while a light flickered in his eyes as if he was deep in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er stood before the window as she looked outside. Although they were in another continent, it was after all still a world of men. In most areas, it was not much different from the Boundless Mainland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, what are we going to do next?” Shangguan Bing\u0027er turned to Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight shined in from outside the window, bathing her in a misty layer of gold. Zhou Weiqing’s eyes could not help but sparkle as he watched her. He beckoned to her with his hand, indicating for her to come to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er walked to the sofa. In the next moment, she fell into Zhou Weiqing’s lap. Zhou Weiqing stealthily said to her, “Bing’er, we need to be careful when we speak from now onwards. From this point onwards, I don’t really have a concrete plan yet and intend to take it one step at a time. For the time being, the top priority is to enter the inner section of XuanTian Palace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing\u0027er looked at him in a puzzled manner as she replied, “In that case, why did you reject Er Chun when he asked if he should send us into XuanTian Palace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled faintly. “A transaction that is sent all the way to one’s doorstep does not have much worth. We need to be somewhat aloof to make them value us more. Don’t be anxious. Hasn’t Er Chun already went to report? Someone will likely be sent to receive us later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er stifled a giggle and said, “You are really a swindler.” After which, her expression suddenly became rather stern, “Little Fatty, promise me something. Whether or not we are able to succeed this time, don’t take any risks, alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing did not reply but instead gently kissed her red lips. On the giant sofa, he completely buried her slim and lovely figure in his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.” Er Chun’s voice rang out from outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving taken a bath and changed into clean clothes, Zhou Weiqing was currently seated on the sofa as he ate the fruit which Shangguan Bing\u0027er had peeled. He said passively, “Enter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Er Chun walked in from outside. However, he had only taken a single step in and respectfully stood to one side as he made an inviting gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing his gesture, a tall elder walked in from outside. This elder was a whole two meters tall. Although his white hair and beard indicated that he was not young, his back was rather straight and his muscular frame propped up his clothes. On a whole, he gave off a very vibrant feeling which did not lose to any youngster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe too wore the long blue robes of XuanTian Palace, but Zhou Weiqing immediately saw a gleaming gold sun emblem on his left breast. It was very clear that this person’s status in the XuanTian Palace was much higher than Er Chun’s. In addition, the presence and aura given off by his body the moment he appeared was far beyond what Er Chun could compare to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was still seated on the sofa and showed no signs of getting up to receive the old man. The elder’s gaze directly landed on his face as two sharp gazes seemed to stab towards him like sharp swords, while a powerful pressure instantly locked onto Zhou Weiqing’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing remained seated while he ate the fruit, as if he was unable to feel anything. This tiny bit of pressure was really nothing to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh, he does indeed have some ability. Er Chun, is he the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master you mentioned?” The elder also ignored Zhou Weiqing as he sent an inquiry towards Er Chun by the side. His low and deep voice brought with it an intense shock wave that made one’s ear buzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, esteemed Elder. Lord God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, let me introduce you. This is Elder Fei Lun, one of the twelve Elders of our XuanTian Palace. He is in charge of external affairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded and pointed towards the sofa. “Kindly be seated, Elder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFei Lun waved his hand. Er Chun quickly took the hint and withdrew, closing the door behind him. Fei Lun walked to the sofa opposite Zhou Weiqing and unceremoniously sat himself down as the pressure from his body receded. “Young man, Er Chun tells me that you are a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded, but he did not look at the elder and instead continued to eat the fruit from Shangguan Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of fury glinted in Fei Lun’s eyes as he said in a low voice, “You are still so young, are you not afraid that your arrogant manner will bite you in the back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing glanced at him, faintly smiled and retorted, “Aspiration is not related to age. A hundred years of living without aspiration is the same as not living at all.” He purposely cast his gaze at the elder when speaking the latter half. With his Saint Energy cultivation and the presence Fei Lun had released prior, he was able to judge that this elder’s cultivation was around the High Level Heavenly King Stage. The peak Heavenly King Stage was still rather far away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFei Lun’s expression turned even uglier. However, he was after all an elder of XuanTian Palace and his capabilities were far beyond what Er Chun could compare to. He spoke in a low voice, “You should know what kind of price there will be to pay if one deceives XuanTian Palace. Of course, if you can really prove your identity as a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, let alone myself, even the Palace Grand Elder, no, even the Palace Master will welcome you with open arms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled a little. “Does this mean that you are here to verify if I have the ability of a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFei Lun did not beat around the bush and immediately nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing heartily chuckled. “Right here and now? It looks like XuanTian Palace does not treat their guests very well! How can I prove my ability? Creating a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll should be the most direct right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFei Lun replied, “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed coldly and suddenly stood up. “Since that is so, Elder Fei Lun can leave now. We will not be participating in XuanTian Palace’s selection any longer. Bing’er, let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFei Lun was taken aback. There were no gaps in Zhou Weiqing’s arrogant attitude. He hastily stood up and said, “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing disdainfully snorted, “As a Consolidating Equipment Master, creating a Consolidating Equipment Scroll not only require materials and a blueprint, the environment is likewise of utmost importance. Places with dense atmospheric energy will allow the Consolidating Scroll to be more easily created. Your distinguished self cannot possibly not know of this right?” He no longer addressed Fei Lun as Elder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFei Lun subconsciously nodded his head. Although he was not a Consolidating Equipment Master, he had some knowledge of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed icily. “Since Elder understands, yet you are still purposely trying to make me create a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll here? Is this the sincerity of your XuanTian Palace? Furthermore, if I really had the materials to create God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, why would I still need to come to your XuanTian Palace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh…” Fei Lun was rendered speechless. He frowned a little and said, “Your distinguished self should know that if you are really a proven God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, absolutely no tests are needed to join our XuanTian Palace. We will treat you as an honored guest and even give you a top position. Therefore, no matter what, we still need you to display your abilities.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-239-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-240-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-239-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
