Golden Roc Shattering the Void had a total of 12 layers, and the Supreme Elder that passed away only had eight of them within his memories.

Lin Ming’s movement speed and spear speed was inferior to his own, but when he and his Sword Spirit Avatar cut out with five swords, Lin Ming was able to dodge two and block the last three with a single spear.
