I need to find my kids.” I didn’t want to tell them, he was the Master Key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario shook his head with his hand over his face, “Well, that’s all the poverty I can take. Let’s, shall we.” He pointed at the doorway. When Coop didn’t speak Servario turned and left with Luce following him. She smiled back, “He’s sexy. I’m game. It’s better than this shit hole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at the dingy insides, “What is this place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack came out with a plate of food, “My old roommate’s mom’s house. She died and he travels a lot, so he hasn’t sold it yet. He isn’t here. He’s in Thailand. He said we could stay, and apparently, he’s rented the basement out to a nice couple of chubby people with their own deep-fry machine. It’s in the house. She made this fish and chips right downstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and stole a fry, “Those have been around since before you were born, whippersnapper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beamed, “I’m getting my mom to buy one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You eat whatever you want and stay skinny, don’t you?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.” Jack laughed and took the plate of food to the car. He sat up front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Coop with the gun in his hands still, “Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holstered it and sighed, “This is a mistake. Later when he sells us down the river, you remember I said this was a mistake, and that you were thinking with your dick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the door behind him, “I will. Don’t worry, I already have my apology planned out. Have you heard anything about the kids and my mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost sobbed a tiny bit. He walked with me out to the car, “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I hardly know. I need my kids.” I didn’t trust Servario’s word that they were fine. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked concerned, as he squished into the back seat. I sat up front with Jack and made him share his food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good God, I wish we had brought a larger vehicle. That stinks. Please throw it out the window,” Servario asked, sounding snooty. He clearly had never had to stuff a bunch of people into a car before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “No. Steve’s eating some now too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario opened his window and made a sighing noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the tartar sauce homemade too?” Steve asked with a big mouthful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded, “Yes. I watched her make it, while the fish was frying. Amazing woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop snorted, “Size of a damned Buick, you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked back, “You hush your mouth. That woman was a chubby angel. She made me homemade donuts yesterday. I’m marrying a chubby woman. I decided this just yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and dragged a fry through the fatty-mayonnaise tartar sauce, “Never trust a skinny cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve glanced at me, “I thought you were a good cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beamed, “Are you calling me skinny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “You are skinny. Don’t be one of those skinny girls, who doesn’t know she’s skinny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Coop a death stare, “It doesn’t help when people call you fat, all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop looked less than impressed, “I never said you were fat. I said lazy and old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same homicidal look I usually had on my face when I was with him, appeared. I turned around, crossing my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario muttered, “Say something rude like that again, and I won’t need to leak your location.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop laughed. I glanced back at him, “Yeah. Look who has the arms dealer on her side? This old, lazy bitch, that’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop’s eyes gleamed with the things he wanted to say. He gave me a grin and a wink instead. I shook my head and turned around; it wasn’t the response I was expecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove out of the city to a small, private airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve parked the car and walked ahead. I climbed out and followed him. Servario hurried along, “Hurry. They’re close behind us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” Coop asked running for the plane. I cursed my choosing the sexy Christian Louboutin platform, patent-leather jade-colored pumps. They were so pretty. I was never parting with them. I forced Servario to give Roxy money, so she would stop complaining when I tried them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look like a Bratz doll,” Luce said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “His planes have clothes on them. They’re all designer and amazing. It’s a fun distraction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes lit up, “What sizes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “Fours and a couple things in six. Shoes are all size seven. I can squeak into the fours, if I don’t eat or breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkled her nose, “I’m a six for sure, but I can definitely fit the shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered, “You have to sneak them past Roxy. That girl has a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all huffing when we boarded. Everyone put on seat belts as the jet took off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Servario, whispering, “How did you know they were coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I have a friend. He keeps tabs on CI, CIA, MI6, the UN, and Homeland Security. Thus far, they don’t know we have them.” He looked at Coop, Jack, and Luce sitting up a few rows from us with Steve. “They just think I have you for all the fun I can handle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “They sold you to me for information. James found documents linking me to the Burrow. It’s what I have been terrified, you would find. I don’t know how James did it. The man was a bumbling idiot. But, even a broken watch is right twice a day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped, “They knew you were asking for me for sexual purposes?” Horror was smeared across my face. “Why not just kill me? Why do that to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luring your dad.” He gave me a stern look, “The only stipulation was the fat man and Derringer. CI wanted something on you, something they could lure your father with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They told you that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “No. I know because of sources.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, still whispering, “CI knows he’s alive?” I’d barely had time to register it myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. It was in the documentation James must have found. You must have had something at your house, something that linked me and your father to the Burrow. Information that was from after he had died. I played along and said I had been working your dad over all along, because I had to have the Burrow. I acted like I was willing to do anything to get it. They wanted to make your life so hard, that your dad would be forced out of hiding. They were trying to frame you for a variety of things. Mob ties and other unsavory things. Prostitutes and murderesses lose their children.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped, “You let them humiliate and frame me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed so quietly, I barely caught it. He shook his head again, “No. I only let them humiliate you. I own the casino and the hotel. I would have faked the recording, before I let them frame you. You ran when I was trying to help you. Fortunately, I didn’t have to. You are a bit of a genius when it comes to spy work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Coop and shook my head, “No. It was them. They set it up perfectly.” I looked back at him, “You still let everyone believe you were having sex with me, against my will. How could you do that? And why did they believe you wanted the Burrow so badly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look, “Really? I’m a gunrunner, Evie. I always want anything to do with weaponry. Your pride is nothing, compared to the secrets I keep. I’m sorry you were embarrassed to be with me. Now you know how I manage. But if it makes you feel better, I also told them that I wanted you, because I wanted to avenge the death of my father, more than anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brow knit, “Is that true?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and whispered, “I told them I wanted to work out a few weeks of fun with the daughter of the man, who had destroyed my family. Your running, only made me look like a monster. I suppose I owe you a thanks for keeping up my appearances.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides started to tingle, “My dad killed your dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look, “It was the bitter end of the Cold War and the Star Wars were out of control; everyone’s dads were murdering someone. Mine caught wind of the Burrow. He wanted it. Your father, being the Master Key, was dispensed to remove the interest in the Burrow. It’s our job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “Don’t be. Your dad saved my life. I was eighteen and on CI’s payroll, not to mention, given the freedom and finances to do whatever the hell I wanted. I ran the family business the same as I always had, to avoid suspicions. Only I didn’t have to worry, the way my father did. I was given resources. I was able to develop the business and make my family more money, than we could ever spend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed at his face, “You’ve got a bit of arrogance in your teeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, “You Americans have a saying for that… don’t hate the player, hate the game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sickening amount of disgust was filling me, as I processed the fact he’d told me such nice things, and yet, had bargained to have me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jet hit cruising altitude and Coop was out of his seat and back with us, within seconds. He knelt in the seat in front of me, looking us both over, “What the fuck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “He doesn’t like swearing, unless it’s referring to sex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop rolled his eyes, “I care about the terrorist’s feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario’s gaze lowered, “I am not a terrorist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arms dealer… terrorist… same shit, different pile of shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “Wow, this could be fun but let’s not do this. Not on a plane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop tilted his head, “Your call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario scoffed, “I’m comfortable with my cock’s size and how far it can piss, Cooper.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-33.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
