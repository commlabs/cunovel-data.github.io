{"id":34803,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV RUDOLPH ESCAPES","content":"Leaving Tony for a short time, we must return to Rudolph, whom we left in charge of a self-constituted body of police on his way to the lockup.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When first arrested Rudolph was disposed to be violent and abusive. His disappointment was keen, for he was just congratulating himself on the possession of the miser’s gold. Five minutes later, and he would probably have been able to make good his escape. Mingled with his disappointment was a feeling of intense hostility against Tony for his part in defeating his plans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’ll be revenged upon him yet,” he muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They reached the lockup and he was led in. A small oil lamp was lighted and set on the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where are the handcuffs?” asked one of the captors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don’t know. They haven’t been needed for so long that they have been mislaid.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They won’t be needed now. The man can’t get out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rudolph’s face betrayed satisfaction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There’s your bed,” said Moses Hunt, who had Rudolph by the arm, pointing to a rude cot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rudolph threw himself upon it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’m dead tired,” he said, and closed his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door was locked and Rudolph was left alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When five minutes had elapsed—time enough for his captors to get away—he got up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I must get away from this if I can,” thought the tramp, “and before morning. I am glad they didn’t put on handcuffs. Let me see, how shall I manage it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked about him thoughtfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a basement room, lighted only by windows three feet wide and a foot high.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I should like to set fire to the building, and burn it up,” thought the tramp. “That would cost them something. But it wouldn’t be safe. Like as not I would be burned up myself, or at any rate be taken again in getting away. No, no! that won’t do. I wonder if I can’t get through one of those windows?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood on the chair, and as the room was low-ceiled he found he could easily reach the windows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shook them and found to his joy that it would be a comparatively easy thing to remove one of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What fools they are!” he muttered contemptuously. “Did they really expect to keep me here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He removed the window, and by great effort succeeded in raising himself so that he might have a chance of drawing himself through the aperture. It did not prove so easy as he expected. He did, however, succeed at length, and drew a long breath of satisfaction as he found himself once more in the possession of his liberty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’m a free man once more,” he said. “What next?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He would have been glad to return to the miser’s house and possess himself of some of his gold, but the faint gray of dawn was already perceptible, and there was too much risk attending it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Moreover, prudence dictated his putting as great a distance as possible between himself and the village.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hundred miles intervening between New York and that place he got over in his usual way, begging a meal at one house and a night’s lodging at another. He was never at a loss for a plausible story. At one place, where he was evidently looked upon with suspicion, he said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I ain’t used to beggin’. I’m a poor, hard-workin’ man, but I’ve heard that my poor daughter is sick in New York, and I want to get to her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What took her to New York?” asked the farmer whom he addressed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She went to take a place in a store.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m sorry for you,” said the farmer’s wife, sympathizingly. “Ephraim, can’t we help along this poor man?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If we can believe him. There’s many impostors about.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I hope you don’t take me for one,” said Rudolph meekly. “Poor Jane; what would she think if she knew her poor father was so misunderstood.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Poor man! I believe you,” said the farmer’s wife. “You shall sleep in Jonathan’s bed. He’s away now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Rudolph was provided with two abundant meals and a comfortable bed. The farmer’s wife never doubted his story, though she could not help feeling that his looks were not prepossessing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few days later he was in New York. As a general thing he shunned the city, for he was already known to the police, and he felt that watchful eyes would be upon him as soon as it was known that he was back again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the second day he strolled into a low drinking place in the lower part of the city.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A man in shirt sleeves, and with an unhealthy complexion, was mixing drinks behind the bar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hello, Rudolph! Back again?” was his salutation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes,” said the tramp, throwing himself down in a seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where have you been?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Tramping round the country.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where’s the boy you used to have with you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Run away; curse him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Got tired of your company, eh?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He wants to be honest and respectable.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And he thought he could learn better under another teacher, did he?” said the bartender, with a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, I suppose so. I’d like to wring his neck.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re no friend to the honest and respectable, then.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I’m not.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then, there’s no love lost, for they don’t seem to fancy you. What’ll you have to drink?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ve got no money.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll trust. You’ll have some sometime.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Give me some whisky, then,” said the tramp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The whisky was placed in his hands. He gulped it down, and breathed a sigh of satisfaction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then resuming his seat, he took up a morning paper. At first he read it listlessly, but soon his face assumed a look of eager interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was the paragraph that arrested his attention:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Should this meet the eye of Rudolph Rugg, who left England in the fall of 1887, he is requested to communicate with Jacob Morris, attorney at law, Room 1,503, No. —?— Nassau street.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rudolph rose hurriedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Going?” asked the bartender.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes; I’ll be back again soon.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2019/57600.html","bookId":622,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:05 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:05 AM"}
