{"id":33015,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"\u0026nbsp;1 \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To a certain type of mind, the woman who goes to a man\u0027s rooms is already labeled. It seems therefore necessary to explain that Aliette--when she suggested going to Ronnie\u0027s--acted on no passionate impulse, but as the result of a whole afternoon\u0027s deliberation. It was, she felt, vital that they should have speech together; and equally vital that their speech should not be disturbed. Wherefore--fastidiousness revolting alike from a clandestine appointment in Hyde Park or at her husband\u0027s house--she chose the courageous alternative.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now, however, as she strolled quietly down Bond Street at half-past four of a sunlit Monday afternoon, Aliette did not altogether succeed in bridling the fears with which both sex and training strove to stampede her mentality.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She had to say to herself: \"How absurd I am! These are the nineteen-twenties; not the eighteen-sixties. Even discovered, I run no risk of scandal.\" Yet scandal, she knew subconsciously, was the least of the risks she ran in going to Ronnie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless, go she must: even if--worst risk of all--he had misunderstood her motive. The issue between them could not be shirked any longer. Rather a desperate issue it seemed as, at the corner of Conduit Street, Aliette ran into Hector\u0027s father!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rear-Admiral Billy, having arrived at his club two hours since, was taking his first \"cruise round.\" The old man looked the complete Victorian in his white spats, his \"Ascot\" tie, his braided morning-coat and weekday topper. But his \"sponge-bag\" trousers were Georgian enough.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well met, my dear.\" he greeted her. \"Your old father-in-law\u0027s dying for a pretty woman to pour out his tea.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She let him rumble on; accepted his compliments about her hat, her lace frock, her parasol; but refused his offer of a taxi to Ranelagh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m so sorry, Billy. But I\u0027m going--I\u0027m going to tea with some one else.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That be blowed for a tale,\" laughed the admiral. \"You\u0027re coming with me. If Ranelagh\u0027s too far, we\u0027ll make it Rumpelmayer\u0027s.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took her arm; and she began to panic. Billy, in his \"on the spree\" mood, could be very persistent. A few yards on, however, they met Hermione Ellerson. She too, declared the sailor, \"must have a dish of tea with an old man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aliette seized on the opportunity with a quick:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Be a dear, Hermione. Take Billy to Rumpelmayer\u0027s for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll give me strawberries and cream--whatever they cost?\" pouted the ex-plaintiff in Ellerson v. Ellerson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give you anything you want,\" rumbled Rear-Admiral Billy. \"Alie\u0027s going to meet her best boy; so we\u0027ll leave her out of the party.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aliette, on the pretext of shopping, managed an immediate riddance of the pair. Watching them walk off together, she felt rather guilty. Yet the guilt held a certain spice of pleasure, of pride. She was on a dangerous errand, taking risks. She was going--in risk\u0027s despite--to Ronnie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her heart began to throb in anticipation of Ronnie. Passing a mirrored window, she glanced at her reflection, and saw herself well turned-out, en beauté. The sight gave her keenest satisfaction. She walked on, no longer fearful but excited--violently, tremulously excited--till she came to Piccadilly; and turned right-handed toward St. James\u0027s Street. But the clock of St. James\u0027s Palace told her that it still lacked more than a quarter of an hour to their rendezvous.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She turned back again; stood a full minute in admiration of Rowland Ward\u0027s trophies; debated with herself whether she should drop into Fortnum \u0026amp; Mason\u0027s or dawdle at the book-counter in Hatchard\u0027s; decided against both schemes; lingered to examine the Harrison Fisher drawings in the display-window of \"Nash\u0027s Magazine\"; examined the diamond watch at her wrist; and nearly bolted down the Little Arcade into the narrow Londonishness of Jermyn Street.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here again she felt the need for courage; felt as though the whole place--the church under the tree, and the public-house at the corner, the shops and the restaurants--held spies. The street, after broad Piccadilly, seemed furtive, sunless, a street of danger. She wanted to avert her head from the passers-by.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 2\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the time Hector Brunton\u0027s self-possessed wife reached the dark-green Adams door of 127b Jermyn Street, she was as nervous as any other woman in the same equivocal position.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Ronnie\u0027s name-plate, the sedateness of the house, and above all the trim gentleman--obviously a retired butler--who answered her tremulous ringing, did more than a little to restore her confidence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Cavendish? Mr. Cavendish is at home, madam. He is expecting guests.\" (Aliette could have blessed Moses Moffatt for that final \"s.\") \"Allow me to show you the way up, madam.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She followed the restorer of confidence up two dark flights of well-carpeted stairs; and found herself on a half-landing. The white door on the half-landing was just ajar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Whom shall I announce, madam?\" asked the trim gentleman.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aliette hesitated the fraction of a second before replying: \"Mrs. Brunton, Mrs. Hector Brunton.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Moses Moffatt opened the white door, and they passed into the hall of Ronnie\u0027s flat. Automatically Aliette noticed--and admired--the black grandfather\u0027s clock, the one engraving, the beige wall-paper. Then her cicerone knocked on polished mahogany; and a voice, Ronnie\u0027s voice, called, \"Come in.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Moses Moffatt opened the second door; announced the visitor in his best style; and withdrew. They heard the click of his final exit as they faced one another--she still in the doorway, he at the tea-table by the fireplace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a moment, social poise deserted them both; for a moment they could only stare--brown eyes into blue, blue eyes into brown. Then, her sense of humor conquering shyness, Aliette said: \"You were expecting me, weren\u0027t you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It seems too good to be true.\" Ronnie moved across the room towards her; took the hand she proffered; and raised it to his lips. At that, she felt shy again. Confidence deserted her. If he failed in this first test; if, by one word, he betrayed misunderstanding; then, indeed, she would have irretrievably demeaned herself. But Ronnie released her hand after that one kiss; and said, very simply: \"I oughtn\u0027t to have let you come.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Relieved, and a little touched at his words, Aliette let him take her bag and parasol.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t mean you to have tea for me,\" she said, pulling off her gloves. \"Shall I pour out?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll have to boil the kettle first,\" he stammered, fumbling in his pocket for matches. \"You\u0027ll sit here, won\u0027t you! I--I\u0027ve so often imagined you sitting here and pouring out tea for me--Aliette.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you--Ronnie?\" Laughter dimpled her cheeks. She let him lead her to the settee by the tea-table; and sat watching his struggle with the refractory wick. \"Why don\u0027t you have an electric one? They\u0027re so much easier.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are they?\" How shy he seemed!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Rather!\" She imagined herself infinitely the more at ease. \"I like this room.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m so glad. It isn\u0027t my taste, you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really?\" As if she hadn\u0027t guessed whose taste had chosen that beige paper, those écru velvet curtains with their flimsy lace brise-bise, the Aubusson carpet, and the plain silver tea-service on the Chippendale tray!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He did not pursue the subject; and for that reticence her heart went out in thankfulness to him. Yet, at best, his reticence could only be a temporary respite: before she left this room which his mother had furnished for him, the whole issue must be discussed. And the issue--as Aliette well knew--depended, more than on any one else, on Julia Cavendish.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yes! The whole issue, not only as it affected themselves, but as it might affect others, must be threshed out before she left him. Only--only--this respite was very sweet. Why couldn\u0027t life be just one long tea-time! She felt so unutterably happy. A sense, almost a sensuousness, of well-being pervaded her. She wanted no more than this: to be with Ronnie; to hear his voice; to watch his lips, his eyes, his hands as they poured from silver kettle to silver pot; to answer, quietly, impersonally, his quiet impersonal questions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She thought how boyish he looked; how unlike Hector he was in his courtesy, his delicacy. Till suddenly, watching him across the table, she grew conscious of tension in him, of passion. And on that, this business of pouring out his tea, of accepting his cakes, turned to sorriest of farces. She wanted him beside her, close to her; she wanted to hear him whisper, \"Aliette, I love you\"; she wanted to whisper back, \"And I love you, Ronnie. I\u0027ve loved you ever since that first day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All else she had meant to say seemed positively futile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile, to Ronnie, it seemed incredible that he should find the courage to tell her his thoughts; incredible that this vivid, radiant creature, alone with him in the intimacy of his own dwelling-place, should be willing to listen to them. Then, without warning, thought broke to words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All the same, I oughtn\u0027t to have let you come.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why not? I--I wanted to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because----\" The fire in his eyes blinded her. She heard, as through the maze of sleep, steady tick-tick-tick of the clock on the mantelpiece, sizzle of the kettle-flame, the hoot and drone of traffic from the street below. She heard, as a sleeper awakened, the throb of her own heart. She felt tears, tears of sheer joy, close to her eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because?\" she whispered back.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because I love you. Because I can\u0027t trust myself with you. Because you\u0027re\"--he was on his feet now--\"because you\u0027re not mine. And I want you to be mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ronnie! Ronnie!\" Still mazed, she stretched out a hand to him. He seized her hand; and pressed it to his lips, to his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aliette--my dearest--sweetest--I\u0027m behaving like a cad to you. I----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Speech died at his lips; he stood before her, tense, tongue-tied--her hand held, like a shield against her beauty, before his eyes. She knew passion kindling in her, kindling them both to madness; knew the flames of desire a-leap between them; knew the overpowering impulse to immolate herself in the flames of desire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My dear,\" he whispered, \"my dear.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, as in a dream, she divined that the flames leaped no more, that he had mastered passion, that he had fallen to his knees, that he was covering her hand with kisses. \"Forgive me,\" she heard, \"forgive me. I\u0027m not that sort of cad. I didn\u0027t think, just because you came to my rooms----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t.\" Her free hand fondled his hair. \"You mustn\u0027t kneel to me. Please, please----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He rose, her hand still in his; and she drew him down beside her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ronnie----\" She would have looked into his eyes, but his eyes avoided her. \"Ronnie, I don\u0027t want you to think, either now or ever, that it\u0027s caddish of you to--to love me. I--I need your love. I need your love more than I can ever tell you.\" His hand trembled at her words. \"I\u0027m very lonely, and I\u0027m afraid--I\u0027m afraid that I\u0027m very weak. You\u0027re the only person in the world who can help----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then----\" His eyes turned to hers, and she saw hope light in them. \"Then, you do love me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. I love you.\" She laughed--a little strained laugh that was almost a caress. \"I oughtn\u0027t to say that, I suppose.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, my dear\"--now he had prisoned both her hands--\"why shouldn\u0027t you say it? No--no harm shall ever come to you from me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know that.\" Her voice grew almost inaudible. \"Otherwise--I shouldn\u0027t be here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No harm shall ever come to you from me,\" he repeated--and fell silent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They sat for a while, hand in hand, taking quiet comfort from one another, each knowing what must next be said, each fearful of being first to speak. At last, releasing her hands, Aliette braced herself to the ordeal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"About\"--fastidiousness almost overwhelmed her--\"about my--my husband. You understand, don\u0027t you, that he--that he isn\u0027t my husband any more--that otherwise I would never have come to you--that, that it\u0027s been all over between him and me--for, for ever so long.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, dear. I--I understand.\" Very slowly, he drew her toward him. His eyes no longer blinded her; looking deep into the blue of them, she saw only a great comprehension, a great reverence. \"I should have understood--even without your telling me.\" Very slowly, she yielded to the pull of his hands; yielded him her lips. Very clearly she knew herself--as they swayed to one another in that first kiss--his woman.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again, it was a while before either spoke. Then Ronnie said, speaking as simply as any boy:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish I knew what was the right thing to be done. I can\u0027t give you up. Not now! Tell me, if you were free--would you marry me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know that I would.\" She, too, spoke simply of the things in her heart. \"But I\u0027m not free. We\u0027re neither of us free.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You mean that--that I\u0027ll have to give you up?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again she braced herself. \"I--I\u0027m afraid so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because of----\" She could not yet bring herself to mention his mother. \"Because of your career.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My career!\" He laughed, holding her in his arms. \"As if my career had anything to do with it. I\u0027m only a poor devil of a barrister, living on the charitable briefs of Jimmy Wilberforce. It\u0027s you, your reputation that counts, not mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t let my love bring you harm.\" She withdrew from him--her eyes still suffused with happiness; her lips still quivering from his caress.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never mind me. It\u0027s you we have to consider. In law you\u0027re--you\u0027re still your husband\u0027s. Unless he lets you divorce him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027d never do that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why not? It\u0027s lawful. It\u0027s done every day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Even if he would--I couldn\u0027t. It wouldn\u0027t be playing the game.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aliette\"--stubbornly, Ronnie rose to his feet,--\"I--I want you so much that nothing else seems to matter. But I can\u0027t--I won\u0027t ask you to--to do the other thing. You talk about playing the game. What\u0027s the alternative? If you divorce your--your husband, he won\u0027t suffer. Nobody cares what a man does. But the other thing--the other thing\u0027s all wrong----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His words chilled her to fear. But she knew that she must master fear--even as he had mastered passion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you--are you so sure?\" said Aliette. \"Can love, real love, ever be wrong?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He turned on her bluntly, almost rudely. \"Yes, the whole thing\u0027s wrong. It\u0027s wrong of me to let you come here. Wrong of me to love you.\" Then, his reserve breaking down: \"I\u0027ve tried to reason this thing out till I\u0027ve grown nearly mad with it. I\u0027ve always loved my profession; always thought that a lawyer\u0027s first duty was to obey the law. But now, loving you, the law doesn\u0027t seem to count. Only you count. You and your happiness. It\u0027s only you I\u0027m thinking of, not my--my rotten career.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Once again he fell on his knees to her, protesting, incoherent; once again he took her in his arms; and kissed her, very tenderly, on her eyes, on her half-closed lips. His kisses weakened her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ronnie,\" she whispered. \"My Ronnie, I love you so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her whisper kindled him again to passion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aliette,\" he said hoarsely, \"Aliette, I can\u0027t give you up. I can\u0027t live without you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a moment she yielded herself; for a moment her lips, her hands, her whole body clung to their happiness; for a moment all her fears, all her self-torturings were stifled. Then she broke from him; and her eyes grew resolute.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ronnie, there\u0027s some one whom neither of us has considered--your mother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The old cannot stand between the young and their happiness.\" His eyes, too, were resolute. \"We\u0027re still young, you and I. We\u0027ve all our lives to live. And besides\"--he weakened,--\"the mater likes you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She\u0027d hate me if I didn\u0027t make you give me up.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t know her, dear.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do.\" It seemed to Aliette as though her lover were indeed only a boy. \"I know her a thousand times better than you ever will. Mostly because I\u0027m a woman; and a little, perhaps, because I love her son. She would hate me. And--and she\u0027d be right.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nobody could hate you,\" he broke in. \"Nobody who knew the fineness of you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m not fine.\" She put away the joy of his words. \"I\u0027m just a very ordinary person. There\u0027s nothing fine in me--except perhaps my love for you. And, for your sake, I mustn\u0027t let that love blind me to the truth. Can\u0027t you see what my freedom--however I won it--would mean to your mother?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She waited for him to answer; but he sat obstinately silent--his hands clasped about his knees, his eyes on her face. She went on:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your mother doesn\u0027t believe in divorce. It\u0027s against her principles, her religion.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But surely, if he lets you divorce him----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I could never do that. Not now. It would be just--just hypocrisy. And we can\u0027t hurt your mother. We mustn\u0027t. I don\u0027t care about myself. If I thought it were for your happiness, I\u0027d run away with you to-night. But I\u0027m afraid for your career. And I do care, terribly, about making her suffer. Think of the fight she\u0027s put up, all her life, against this very thing; and then, try to think what it will mean to her, to both of you, if you, her son, her only son----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He interrupted violently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She would have no right, no earthly right to interfere.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, don\u0027t, don\u0027t speak like that about her.\" There were tears, tears of real sorrow, in Aliette\u0027s eyes. \"I can\u0027t bear it. I--I can\u0027t bear to think of coming between you. It isn\u0027t fair. She\u0027s loved you all her life. You\u0027re everything in the world to her. And then--then--oh! can\u0027t you understand----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He strove to kiss away the tears; but her hands covered her face from his kisses. He knew himself all one weakness at thought of this hurt in Aliette. And weakening, it seemed to him as though Julia Cavendish were here in the room with them; as though he said to her: \"Mater, this is my one chance of happiness. I can\u0027t let even you take it from me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The vision passed; and he knew himself strong again. His hands parted Aliette\u0027s fingers; he kissed her on the closed eyelids, on the wet cheeks. She clung to him, tearful still. Her lips murmured:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Life is so difficult--so terribly difficult.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said to her: \"We mustn\u0027t make it more difficult. We love each other. We must be true to love. Nothing else matters. As long as you are mine----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am yours. Only yours. You don\u0027t doubt me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At that the last of Ronnie\u0027s scruples vanished. Fiercely, crudely, he strained her to him. \"Aliette, Aliette, my own darling, don\u0027t ask me to give you up. I can\u0027t give you up! I couldn\u0027t endure life without you. Come to me! We needn\u0027t do anything mean, anything underhand. It\u0027s for your happiness--for my happiness----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ronnie--Ronnie----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her lips were fire on his cheeks. The perfume of her was a fire in his mind. Her arms were chains, chains of fire about his body. He crushed her to him; crushed her mouth under his lips. Her whole body ached for him, ached to surrender itself. A sharp pang as of hatred went through her body: she hated him for the thing he would not do; hated herself for the longings in her body.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You hurt me, you hurt me.\" With a sharp cry she broke herself loose from him. \"I thought I was so strong. And I\u0027m weak--clay in your hands.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She stood up, trembling; feeling herself all disheveled, abased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The flame under the kettle had gone out. The tea had gone cold in their half-empty cups. The street below still hooted and droned with traffic. The clock still ticked from the mantelpiece.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I ought to be going,\" she said, eying the clock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\" He, too, had risen: he, too, was trembling. \"You ought to be going. It\u0027s nearly half-past six. But you\u0027ll come to me again. You\u0027ll come again--Aliette.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He found her gloves, her bag and parasol. Taking them, she knew that her hands had lost their coolness; little pearls of emotion moistened either palm. Her face, seen in the mirror over the mantelpiece, looked strangely flushed--different. For the flash of a second, her fastidiousness was in revulsion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll come again--soon?\" he repeated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Revulsion passed; but her hands, straightening her hat, shook as though in self-disdain. \"Somehow, it doesn\u0027t seem fair--on either of us.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you must.\" His voice thrilled. \"You must. We can\u0027t leave things like this--undecided.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Self-possessed once more, she faced him. \"Don\u0027t try to hurry me, Ronnie. We\u0027ve talked too much this afternoon. My brain\u0027s weary. I can\u0027t decide anything. I thought that, being with you, things would be easier. They\u0027re not. They\u0027re more difficult. You must give me time----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then\"--his voice saddened--\"I haven\u0027t been any help to you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A laugh rose in her throat, dimpling it. \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re neither of us very wise; but\"--she offered him her ungloved hand--\"it\u0027s been very sweet, being with you. That\u0027s why--you haven\u0027t helped me very much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Silently, hating that she must go, he released her fingers. She was all a wonder to his eyes, all a riddle to his brain. He wanted to say: \"But you mustn\u0027t go. You\u0027re mine, mine. I don\u0027t care a damn for your husband, for my career, for my mother, for the law. Stay with me. Stay with me to-night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Actually, he forebore even to kiss her good-by!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 3\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aliette had been gone an hour. . . .\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Moses Moffatt came in. Moses Moffatt cleared away the tea-things. Moses Moffatt asked: \"Will you be dining at home, sir?\" Some one answered, \"No!\" Moses Moffatt went out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aliette had been gone two whole hours. The some one became Ronald Cavendish.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He found that he must have been smoking cigarettes--one cigarette after the other. Ash and paper smoldered on the silver tray at his side. The room stank of tobacco. But tobacco could not drive away that other perfume--the perfume of Aliette\u0027s womanhood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She had been in this very room! The essence of her still pervaded every nook of it. His imagination conjured up the image of her: Aliette dimpling to laughter: Aliette\u0027s brown eyes, now bright with joy, now dimmed with tears: the vivid of Aliette\u0027s hair: the little gestures of Aliette\u0027s hands. All these he saw, and possessed again in memory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again she lay in his arms. Again she let him kiss the tears from her eyes. Again she yielded him her hands, her hair. But she had yielded him more than these; she had yielded him her very thoughts: she had said, \"I\u0027m very weak; you\u0027re the only person who can help me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Remembering those words, he grew ashamed. He must not think for himself: he must think for her. She had said that she would marry him if she were free. But there was only one way to freedom--unless Brunton let her divorce him. And that alternative she had refused to contemplate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No! There was only one path to her freedom, to their happiness--the path of scandal. Dared he demand that sacrifice from her?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After all, why not? The scandal would be short-lived--the happiness enduring. She was Brunton\u0027s merely in name. She had no children. Legally, they might have to put themselves in the wrong; but morally they would be justified. Between them and happiness stood only the shibboleths.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless, the shibboleths mattered. Shibboleths were the basis of all society.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Certain people, too--people like his mother,--hated divorce, believed it wicked. His mother still clung to the old faith. His mother would say: \"God joined Aliette and Hector in holy matrimony. You have no right to sunder God\u0027s joining.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As though humanity were any deity\u0027s stud-farm!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90602.html","bookId":400,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:36:23 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:36:23 AM"}
