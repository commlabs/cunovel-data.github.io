It’d been years since we’d bothered to use any kind of contraceptive. I’d just assumed babies were impossible. Finding out I was wrong made my ears ring and my vision blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Caroline was pregnant. My wife and the love of my life was going to have my baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy fuck.” My hands went to my hair to clutch my swimming head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow, Ten,” Pick murmured, sounding impressed. “You must have some kind of super sperm to overcome odds like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re damn right I do,” I said, still dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hard hand clasped my shoulder. “Hey,” Gamble said seriously. “You okay, bud?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him and blinked him into focus. “Yeah. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes crinkled with worry. “You look like you’re trying to check out on us. You ready to be a dad, or what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, just thinking of that word being applied to me made me break out in a cold sweat. Fuck no, I wasn’t ready to be a dad. I wanted to be a good dad, like my own dad was, but how could I possibly do that when I had no clue what being a dad truly entailed? I wanted my kid to have everything amazing. The best life ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I realized it would; it’d have Caroline as a mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a snort, I rolled my eyes at Gam. “You ready to be an uncle?” I challenged right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenuine pleasure gleamed in his face as he smiled. “Oh, I am so ready to be your kid’s uncle. I’m going to spoil your kid more than you spoil my Beau.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring it,” I said, ready to take him on, confident I could out-spoil his kid, no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Ten,” Blondie murmured softly, jerking my attention away from Gam. When she caught my eye, she zipped her gaze to Caroline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at my wife and straightened, instantly alarmed. Instead of full of energy and eagerness as she’d been moments ago, her face had drained of all color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, what’s wrong?” I tugged her out of her chair and down into my lap, where I pressed my hand to her abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covered the back of my palm with cold fingers and looked up into my eyes, worry and fear creasing her face. “Are you okay with becoming a dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you kidding me?” I blurted out a surprised laugh and pressed my forehead to hers. “I’m...I’m so far and gone past okay, I’m fucking trembling with it.” I cupped her face in my hands. “We’re going to have a baby, Caroline. A little piece of you, a little piece of me. I can’t...I can’t even process this it’s so fucking awesome. We’re finally getting our Inez Dumaine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediate tears filled her eyes. “Oh my God. You remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I remember. Why would I forget the name you want to give our daughter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” she sobbed. “I love you so much, Oren Tenning, it almost scares me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not nearly as much as I love you,” I shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my pregnant wife cried and kissed me, I turned a little drippy myself. But shit, this had to be one of the happiest moments of my life, in the arms of the woman I loved, surrounded by my best friends on earth, and hearing I was going to be a father. Who the hell wouldn’t drop a tear? I certainly couldn’t refrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if any of you fuckers reading this even think about spreading around the fact that I bawled like a pussy when I found out I was going to be a dad, I’ll kick all your asses. This is my goddamn happily ever after; I’ll cry if I want to. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-179.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
