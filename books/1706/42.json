And they say, back in 1815 the population of New York was a hundred twenty thousand. Today it\u0027s eight million. The city has grown by six thousand percent. To say nothing of all those skyscrapers and air-conditioning and concrete. Now, I ask you. Is it reasonable to believe that a city that has grown by six thousand percent is hotter because of a tiny increase in little old carbon dioxide around the world? Or is it hotter because it is now much, much bigger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back in her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s easy to counter that argument,\" Evans said. \"There are many examples of small things that produce big effects.

Photographers\u0027 strobes flashed. \"I am John Balder, and standing with me is Nicholas Drake, the president of the National Environmental Resource Fund. Here also is Jennifer Haynes, my lead counsel, and Peter Evans, of the law firm of Hassle and Black.

Now it had been transformed into a certainty in less than a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalder spoke in vivid terms about how the people of Vanutu were being flooded out of their ancestral homeland, emphasizing the tragedy of young children whose heritage was washing away in raging surf caused by a callous industrial giant to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a matter of justice for the people of Vanutu, and of the future of the entire world now threatened by abrupt weather, that we\u0027re announcing this lawsuit today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he opened the floor to questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one was, \"When exactly are you filing this lawsuit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The issue is technically complex,\" Balder said. \"Right now, we have in our offices forty research scientists working on our behalf day and night.

Evans glanced over at Jennifer, standing on the other side of the podium. She tapped her watch. Evans nodded, then looked at his own watch, made a face, and exited the podium. Jennifer was right behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went inside the warehouse and past the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Evans stared in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 60\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCULVER CITY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, OCTOBER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1:20 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights were turned down. Most of the people Evans had seen earlier were gone. The rooms were being stripped, the furniture stacked up, the documents packed into legal storage boxes. Movers were carrying out stacks of boxes on rolling dollies. Evans said, \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our lease is up,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re moving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No. We\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, we\u0027re leaving, Peter.

I have complete confidence in the forty brilliant men and women who are assisting us in this ground-breaking case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans stepped back as movers carried a table past him. It was the same table he had been interviewed at just three hours before. Another mover followed, lugging boxes of video equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is this going to work?\" Evans said, hearing Balder over the loudspeaker. \"I mean, people are going to know what\u0027s happening amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening is perfectly logical,\" Jennifer said. \"We will file a request for a preliminary injunction. Our pleading has to work its way through the system. We expect it will be rejected by the district court for jurisdiction, so we will take it to the Ninth Circuit, and then we expect to go to the Supreme Court. The litigation cannot proceed until the issue of injunction is resolved, which could take several years. Therefore we sensibly put our large research staff on hold and close our expensive offices while we wait with a skeleton legal team in place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a skeleton team in place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But you asked how it would be handled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans watched as the boxes rolled out the back door. \"Nobody ever intended to file this lawsuit, did they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s put it this way,\" she said. \"Balder has a remarkable winning record in the courtroom.

Because I guarantee you, no court is going to grant injunctive relief for excess carbon dioxide production by the American economy.\" She pointed to the loudspeaker. \"Drake got him to emphasize abrupt climate change. That nicely dovetails with Drake\u0027s conference, which starts tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" she said. \"You know as well as I do that the whole purpose of this case was to generate publicity.

Evans wandered back into the interrogation room and saw the stack of foam core graphs in the corner. He had wanted to see the ones she hadn\u0027t shown him, so he pulled a few out.
