The fifth transformation of the Cloud Lightning Forefather was complete!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe now radiated a terrifying aura, and the moon sigil in his left eye gave him additional power equal to three transformations. In total, he now wielded the power of… the eighth transformation!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBack when Master Cloud Lightning had actually reached the eighth transformation, his power surpassed the late Deva Realm and came close to the great circle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, Bai Xiaochun was now even more shockingly powerful than that!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, that brought him no joy, only fear, because after the fifth transformation was complete, his body reached the point that it could not accept any more of the lightning from the black cloud.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe lightning writhed madly as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun, driving fear into his heart as he scrambled backward. He was now much faster than before, and yet, far more lightning had gathered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, instead of having to deal with hundreds of thousands of lightning bolts, there were over a million….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a profoundly shocking scene. Off in the distance, the Lightning Ancestor was completely gobsmacked, and was shaking physically. By this point, he had completely forgotten about the fifty lightning bolts that Bai Xiaochun still owed him, and was doing everything he could to get his cell as far away as possible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You absolutely, positively must not get close to me…. don’t do it!! My old body can’t take this…. Kids nowadays are all psychos….” However, it was in that exact moment that Bai Xiaochun happened to look over, and caught sight of the Lightning Ancestor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen their eyes met, the Lightning Ancestor screamed, and drew upon all the strength he could muster to send his cell shooting in the opposite direction. As for Bai Xiaochun, he looked like the picture of grief and indignation as he did everything he could to get out of the range of the lightning. Sadly, more and more lightning was building up with every moment that passed….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs Bai Xiaochun fled, his eyes wide with terror, he suddenly sensed that the lightning was starting to tremble with dangerous instability….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s gonna blow?!?!?!” His scalp tingled madly as he screamed and pushed forward with greater speed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, the Lightning Ancestor’s eyes were about to pop out of his skull. However, at the same time, he was starting to get a bit excited.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s gonna blow? Great! The crazier the better. Maybe… this will be my chance to get out of here!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the outside world, the black cloud was shaking nonstop. Virtually no lightning bolts were visible at all from the outside, and the cloud was starting to emanate an unsettling aura, as though something explosively dangerous were brewing deep inside of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe twin Master Cloud Lightnings, Feng Chen, and the other northern devas were all racing toward the cloud, and when they saw what was happening, their faces fell dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey tried to send divine sense into the cloud to determine what exactly was happening, but because of the unusual properties of Lightning Penitentiary, they were unable to make out any specific details.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“What exactly is going on here!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! This is definitely Bai Xiaochun’s doing!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the other three devas were quick to cast blame on Master Cloud Lightning and Feng Chen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It’s your fault, Feng Chen! You should never have come up with the idea for the three-point covenant!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re to blame too, Master Cloud Lightning! This Bai Xiaochun is a walking disaster! Why the hell did you bring him here to begin with!?!?” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe twin Master Cloud Lightnings and Feng Chen had very unsightly expressions on their faces, but there was nothing they could say in response. As everyone looked on nervously, a stream of divine sense erupted from the crystal coffin which shook the hearts of even the devas. It quickly entered the black cloud, whereupon an enraged roar erupted out that shook heaven and earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Xiaochun!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the demigod patriarch materialized in midair. He looked extremely anxious, and didn’t even take the time to say anything. He simply waved his hand out into the air!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA powerful blast of wind erupted out, swept over the black cloud, grabbed all of the cultivators on it, and then teleported them off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the exact moment that the demigod patriarch accomplished that, a shocking boom erupted out, the likes of which had never been heard in the north before. The source? The black cloud which made up the Lightning Order, which had just exploded!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe noise was so loud that countless cultivators immediately began to cough up blood. Even the devas were shaken, and were shoved backward through the air.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of the buildings which rested on the black cloud land mass were reduced to ash as innumerable lightning bolts erupted out in all directions. It almost looked like a dragon made of lightning were climbing up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen came the screaming shockwave, which rolled out in all directions, causing the sky to dim. As for the black cloud itself… much of it was reduced to nothing more than rubble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCracks began to spread out in the Lightning Order’s battle god statue…. It was almost as if the entire Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect had come under attack. The Cloud Order’s statue was missing a finger, and now the Lightning Order’s statue was visibly damaged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe twin Master Cloud Lightnings hovered there in complete shock. Feng Chen’s jaw was hanging open, and his eyes were wide. The other devas reacted in similar fashion. As for the demigod patriarch, he was so angry that he was shaking, and his hair was standing on end.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Lightning Order cultivators who had been teleported away were stunned to the extreme. The Lightning Order now looked completely different from before, and the change had occurred so quickly that they had no chance to even react.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, the Cloud Order cultivators were all feeling very blessed that Bai Xiaochun had not been locked up in their part of the sect….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, they were even more terrified by his ability to cause catastrophes!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“This Bai Xiaochun… must \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e be provoked….”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The deva patriarchs are out of their minds. Everything was fine until they had to go and confine him to the Cloud Order. First, he went and sold medicinal toxins to our Cloud Order cultivators, and then he destroyed half of the Cloud Order with his flower….”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Then they had to go and lock him up in Lightning Penitentiary, which is supposedly strong enough to keep even demigods in check. But this guy… actually blew the entire place up!! And look, almost half of the Lightning Order’s black cloud has now been destroyed!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens, is this guy even human?!?! How did the cultivators in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect manage to stay alive all this time!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Everybody says that his pill concocting is the stuff that can shake heaven and earth. But he never even concocted medicine here in the north. And look how it ended up…. I bet if he had concocted medicine, he would have destroyed all of the northern Heavenspan River!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, a cacophony of conversation filled the air. The entire Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect was abuzz. And that was when… people began to take notice of a bedraggled figure climbing up from within the rubble of the black cloud….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s face was pale, and he was dripping with sweat. After all, he had very nearly been fried to a crisp just now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I’m definitely never going to absorb any more lightning ever again. It\u0027s way too dangerous!!” Even as he crawled out into the open, he heard a howl of rage echoing from above.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Xiaochun!!” It was the demigod patriarch, whose rage surpassed heavenly might, and startled Bai Xiaochun so much that he jumped up into the air. The demigod patriarch took a step forward toward Bai Xiaochun, and yet, before he could do anything else, suddenly looked off in a different direction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How dare you try to escape, Lightning Ancestor!!” The demigod patriarch shoved his hand out, causing the air off in the distance to shatter, revealing the emaciated Lightning Ancestor who, without pausing for even a moment, spun in place and shot off into the distance like a bolt of lightning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe demigod patriarch had no time to worry about Bai Xiaochun. Face turning very grim, he sped off in pursuit of the Lightning Ancestor. Catching him was far more important than punishing Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe events playing out had Bai Xiaochun sweating nervously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not sticking around the north any longer than I have to. I need to get out of here!” At this point, he completely ignored the Dharmic decree of the Celestial, and fled from the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as he did, Feng Chen let out a cry of rage and shot after him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFeng Chen actually had taken a liking to Du Lingfei, and therefore, hated Bai Xiaochun even more than could be imagined. He had been very proud of this three-point covenant, and had imagined that it would be a big torment to Bai Xiaochun. Never could he have imagined that instead, Bai Xiaochun would turn the tables and throw the entire sect into chaos. And that only served to fuel Feng Chen’s hatred.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eImmediately drawing upon a trump card, he transformed into a crimson bolt of lightning that brimmed with destructive power as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Bai Xiaochun was just as angry, and spun in place to face him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-967\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-969\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-968","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
