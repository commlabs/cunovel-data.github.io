As such, despite its great power, its practical effects were less so.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever… Zhou Weiqing had somehow succeeded in controlling it. \u0026nbsp;Without question, he must have relied on his Saint Energy to cast the Time Reversal, causing this relatively useless Heavenly God Tier Skill to suddenly become truly monstrous in power.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing was no God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in practice, but he had the knowledge. Now, thanks to this ‘Time Reversal’ technique, he was able to slowly complete a God Tier Consolidating Scroll one step at a time. \u0026nbsp;So what if he made mistakes? \u0026nbsp;He’d just reverse time and fix it! \u0026nbsp;So long as he could successfully complete one stroke at a time, he’d eventually succeed in finishing the entire thing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs for the expenditure in Saint Energy? \u0026nbsp;To Zhou Weiqing, he only needed to use a tiny amount to keep the effect active. \u0026nbsp;The energy expenditure was virtually negligible. \u0026nbsp;He was after all a nine-Jeweled cultivator. However, even if he really was just a five-Jeweled cultivator, the low energy expenditure meant that he should still be able to sustain this process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLittle Fatty, you really are brilliant.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; The only thing which Shangguan Bing’er felt was approval. \u0026nbsp;Her Little Fatty was simply too brilliant. \u0026nbsp;Clearly, he had already come up with this plan when he first proclaimed himself a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. \u0026nbsp;He had prepared everything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing continued with his manufacturing process. \u0026nbsp;By now, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were completely stupefied.
