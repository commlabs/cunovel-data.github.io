It\u0027s a beautiful property but the house is a mess. The brown siding is rotting off and the inside looks like it\u0027s suffered through an earthquake. The stairs are shifted. It\u0027s a perfect place for the animals and infected to hide. I close the crooked front door and don’t go in. It\u0027s one of the rules I have—don’t go in unless there is no other option. At this point, going in is an option only for curiosity’s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees look amazing; they don’t look sick at all. The leaves are bright and green, and the apples are bright and red. They are ready to harvest fast this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dry borderlands are surprisingly good for farming. I pick another apple and walk towards Anna. She\u0027s staring off into space, holding her leaf of food, but not moving. Her face is lost in whatever she\u0027s remembering. Her eyes drop down as a blush crosses her face but she doesn’t smile. I can imagine what she\u0027s remembering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can imagine the pain she\u0027s in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that pain. It\u0027s a dusty, dry, hollow ache in my heart too. It’s the feel of my lips pressed against his hand. He wasn’t normal, or functional, or sane, but he was my match in this crazy world where things don’t make sense anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Let\u0027s start walking towards the hills and see if it\u0027s the right way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words pull her from the daydream. She gets up, still forcing herself to eat. Our footsteps are the only sound surrounding us, besides the slight whistle of the warm wind through the orchard. The fruit is almost as good as drinking water. The juice it makes in my mouth as I take small bites, quenches some of my thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are out of water and ammo, and I am out of care. If I drop dead in the dusty hills in front of us, I don’t care. I want Leo, Sarah, Jake, and even Star, but I want Will more. I even want Bernie more because I want that look in Anna\u0027s eyes to come back. Her face isn’t sad; it\u0027s the opposite. I can see she\u0027s grateful for what she had, even if it was short lived. Her bravery knows no bounds, and I am the only one who is never going to be okay again. She will be. She has been disappointed so much in this life, that even a broken heart can\u0027t stop her spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe enter the denser forest, picking up the pace. I have no gun, or bow, or anything. I have my knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what I thought the world looked like; I never gave it much thought. It was all survival before, but now with him gone, it feels like the world is broken. I think I finally know what it feels like to be normal. Everyone else has lived through this all along, but I haven’t. I\u0027ve survived and now I\u0027m not sure I want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hike until my throat dries out and the apples are gone. She sits down on a rock in the middle of nowhere and shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I know. We\u0027re lost.\" I whistle again and sit down next to her. The forest is silent, not a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t even want to listen to the sounds of the forest. I just want to close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to stop, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown at her, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears fill her eyes making them sparkle; they\u0027re so blue. Her lip quivers as she shakes her head, \"You have to stop. I see it. He wouldn’t want this to end you. I see the anger and will to live are gone. They would want us to find the others and be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is still the fragile girl standing outside my door with big blue eyes, wanting to sacrifice herself for Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes fill with tears, \"I just don’t know how to feel.\" My voice cracks. \"He died for me. He died, but I coulda lived. I coulda lived through that bullet. I\u0027m stronger than he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I know, but he didn’t want you to get shot.\" Her voice makes the high moan of the infected when she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and shudder. The tears are coming faster than I can cry them out. They\u0027re choking me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scent hits me as warm fur smothers me and huge paws wrap around me. He found us. I wrap my arms around his neck, digging my fingers into his fur. I feel her arms wrap around us too. He pants into my neck, making his crazy wolf noises. I can\u0027t stop shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smell is the same as always. He nips at me lightly. I nod, \"I know. I\u0027m sorry I left you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna cries into him too. The three of us sit at the top of a hill, weeping and hugging. His head lifts, looking behind us. I swear he\u0027s looking for Will and Bernie. His yellow eyes scan the hill and then me. I shake my head, sobbing harder. He puts his head into the wind and cries out the haunting sound he made when Meg died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my face, letting his song become part of the wind on my skin. He finishes and stands, like he\u0027s ready to go home. I am too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna takes my hand, squeezing hard. She smiles, \"We\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, wiping my face and follow Leo down the hillside. He keeps checking behind his shoulder to make sure we\u0027re still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe isn’t going to trust us for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of the hill, I recognize the road we’ve come upon. He walks, looking around nervously until we reach the entrance to the driveway. My heart lifts a little when we get in view of the house. It looks the same. No cars, no wars, no anger, and no strangers. Just a house, a rock pile grave, and a yard filled with memories I don’t want, but I love anyway. I love the fact I can close my eyes and see them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar comes running out. Her eyes look behind us, but she knows when we get closer. Her eyes drop. Her destroyed expression becomes part of the memories I don’t want. Jake\u0027s face is next. He looks past us. His gaze settles on Anna\u0027s face. Whatever the look on her face is, it tells him everything he needs to know. He stops walking, watching her and waiting for her to change the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar does something I don’t expect. She wraps her arms around me, \"Is he gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod once. She shakes, crying silently. \"Will too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again, hugging her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake sees us, his blue eyes glisten with the tears filling them. He shakes his head, \"No way. No way. We just got him back. No, he\u0027s strong. You wait and see, he\u0027s gonna come.\" The tears leave his eyes, streaming down his face. Leo walks to him, rubbing against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s son comes out of the house. His face falls. He presses his lips together and lowers his gaze. Sarah bursts from the house, leaping at me. I hug her and Star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made it back.\" She looks past me, \"Where\u0027s Will and Bernie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, letting her down on the grass. Her little face loses the joy she had. She starts to cry silently, turning away from me. She walks to Meg\u0027s grave. Leo follows her, as does Andy when he comes walking out of the house. They sit next to the rock pile with their backs to us. Andy holds her hand. Somehow, it\u0027s the worst and best thing I\u0027ve ever seen. Even Leo doesn’t mind Andy anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake and Anna are sobbing, holding each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar wipes her face, \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffle, \"Bernie got shot by a guard in the city and I killed Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks at me but Anna shakes her head. She points at me, \"He would have wanted that choice. You made it fair for everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shakes his head, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall knew about a missile in the city that could be launched, and it would take away all the power from the whole country. No trucks, cars, and technology. No city and breeder farms or work camps. No one doing better than anyone else. Me and Bernie found it, and with his last breath, he launched the missile. Will was on a machine that kept him alive, when the power went out… so did Will.\" I realize how cold it sounds as I say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one says anything for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Star nods, \"I\u0027m glad Bernie got to fix his mistakes. It\u0027s always bothered him that he was part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s son points at the house, \"We noticed the power was gone. Nothing is working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake wipes his eyes, \"Will would have done the same thing. He wanted this to end, always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. I don’t have anything to add to it. I don’t want to talk about it. I turn and walk to Sarah and Leo. I sit on my knees next to her. She looks at me with a tear-stained face. She sniffles, \"I was just telling Meg to go find Bernie and Will and make sure they stay with her, so we can all find them again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words are like a knife in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the grave, \"She\u0027ll keep them entertained and busy until we get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo lays down and we sit in silence, grieving the same people for different reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten more people, Em. We can\u0027t keep this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Sully, Jack\u0027s son, and shake my head, \"What can we do? It\u0027s only two months till the snow hits. We can\u0027t turn people away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"Em, the entire camp is on its way. Jack told me how big that camp was. The place they go for winter has been taken over by other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last two months, the changes that have taken place have made everything harder for everyone. Everyone but us rebels, who were used to being cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"We need to help them set up their camp here. How many houses are built?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"Four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"The barn can convert if it\u0027s needed. We need to make sure the fireplaces are set up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"I know. I just wanted to tell you, ten more people have arrived, with word that a lot more are on their way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" I leave the kitchen, walking past people straggling in. I grab an apple and some seeds from the sunflowers, and go look for Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s still green around the gills and looking exhausted but she doesn’t stop. She points at the barn and tells the man with the armload of fire wood where it needs to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles when she sees me. There is joy on her face; that is one of the few things keeping me going. I pass her the apple, \"You have to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs, \"Em, I ate like an hour ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"You eat this and I won\u0027t bug you for a couple hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah stumbles over, running with Leo. Her face is lit up, \"The meat racks work!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her, \"Did it dry them?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-23.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
