He stared down at the hole we had come from, confused, and then closed the door I had thrown open. I saw that the door and its frame were in fact laying loose on the ground, flung aside when the blast destroyed the wall. When John picked up the door again, underneath was just dead grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “Shit, I left my shotgun shells back at the Caddie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath and said, “Look … you remember when we watched Star Wars with Amy? And she’s like, ‘Why is Princess Leia being such a bitch when those guys just rescued her?’ Well I don’t want to be the Leia in this situation and I completely appreciate what a sweet ramp job that was back there. But did you have any kind of a plan at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m working on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because time is running out here…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was looking up at the old building, staring hard at the mossy brick walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I took some Soy Sauce earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. And I came by here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And … there were shadows here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his gaze. The rows of windows in the moldy brick were boarded over with ancient, warped plywood. It kind of made it seem like the building had cataracts. I saw no shadow people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Do you see any now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and saw something else, though, and said, “Here,” handing me the green mystery box. He jogged away from me, heading for the corner of the building. I spotted the ass of an RV parked there. I followed him. Faint shouts from the armed mob were growing louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John! What are you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words died at the sight of bloodstained grass surrounding the loose earth of a huge, freshly filled-in hole. Like a mass grave. John pulled out his ridiculous customized shotgun (he had it wedged down the back of his pants) and ducked into the RV. The windshield was busted out and when I followed John through the driver’s-side door, I saw that the tan upholstery of the driver’s seat was one big bloodstain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading with the shotgun, John quickly searched the inside. There were rows of hooks on the opposite wall that it took me a moment to realize were gun racks, all of which were now empty. John started throwing open foot lockers and found them stocked with at least four different types of ammunition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bingo,” he said, stuffing his pockets with shotgun shells. “See? Things have a way of working out. We needed shells, and here they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around. On the floor was a busted laptop computer. At the very back, the floor was damp and it smelled like piss. There didn’t seem to be anything of use here other than the bullets—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no. Oh, fuck no. No, no, no…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn joined me and said, “What? I think these were…” but his words trailed off. He saw what I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo objects, that a man in denial could have dismissed as meaningless: a mostly empty tub of red licorice, and an orthopedic pillow designed for people with back problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really only told me what I already knew. She’d come for me, because that’s who she was, and she’d find a way in, because she was too capable not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn glanced nervously out of a side window. The mob would wash in at any moment. He was saying, “Okay, we don’t know this was hers. And even if it was, we do know that isn’t her blood in the driver’s seat. Amy can’t drive…” but I was already jumping out of the RV. Outside, I immediately I saw another, smaller bloodstain, this one in the grass in front of an open basement window. Laying in it was a single empty shoe. A man’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Amy got somebody to give her a ride in. So they pulled up, something nasty came flying out of that window down there, and they killed the shit out of it. Look—next to the window. Spent shotgun shell. Maybe it got the driver first. Then the rest of the posse in the RV, and Amy if she was with them, they bail out and go inside. Probably in there right now. Then a hobo came along and pissed in the RV.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dave, why would they—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring him, I leaned my head down toward the basement window and yelled, “AMY! HEY! AMY? IT’S DAVE.” Nothing. “ANYBODY? IS THERE ANYBODY IN THERE?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shot was fired. A bullet took a chip out of the wall. We ducked and John grabbed my sleeve, yanking me around the corner, toward the front door. Neither one of us had to debate the merits of getting down and crawling through that basement window. That violated two rules of living in Undisclosed: 1) never put yourself in a spot where you don’t have an open, and fast, means of escape, and 2) don’t go through any entrance that has a huge goddamned bloodstain in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the front door and John said, “Plug your ears.” He pointed the shotgun at the locks on the front door and blew a grapefruit-sized hole in the wood. We pushed our way inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e105 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt appeared the feds left behind anything that would take more than five minutes to load onto a truck. Boxes of medical supplies and biohazard suits and filters for biohazard suits and every other thing lined the main hallway, abandoned in the evacuation. Halogen work lamps were set up on stands here and there, a few of them still on, blasting bluish beams through the shadows of the huge corpse of a building. We pushed the front door closed and dragged a huge metal cabinet in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of breath, I said, “We could have relocked that door but somebody blew a hole in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And by the way, those shotgun shells in the RV? They weren’t there waiting for us because a guardian angel dropped them from the sky because you needed help. They were there because somebody else, somebody who believed in being prepared, paid for them with their own money. Keep that in mind the next time you get yourself in a bind and somebody is there for you with bail money or a sofa to sleep on. It isn’t providence. It’s generous people who work hard jobs to buy things you can take.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were jogging down a main hallway now, heading deeper into the building. John said, “Search one of these crates. See if you can find some fucking antidepressants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, all right—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously, it’s an emergency. I’ll cram them down the barrel of the gun and blow them right into your brain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe moved in silence for a moment and I said, “How did we screw this all up so badly, John?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “We always find a way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had to stop to climb over a knocked-over pile of plastic storage bins in the hall. I said, “Damn, the feds left in a hurry. They got overrun? By infected?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly. I told you Falconer had to spring me out of here, we had to blow a huge hole in the wall to do it. They had us in like a big gymnasium and we saw a couple of liquid oxygen tanks along the wall and we’re like, ‘Let’s blow that shit up and get the hell out of here.’ It worked but I guess in the confusion a bunch of the infected they were holding here got loose and they decided to just leave town and let the situation sort itself out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, you’re the reason the feds abandoned ship? Jesus, John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well I feel like it’s their fault for trying to hold me. They should have known that shit comes with consequences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn clicked three shells into his ridiculous tri-barreled shotgun, glancing nervously back toward the front doors. Nobody came crashing through. Wait, was the armed, angry mob scared to come in here? That couldn’t be a good fucking sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“AMY? ANYBODY?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEchoes bounced off moldy walls. The building seemed five times bigger on the inside. It had the tangled floor plan common to all hospitals, seemingly designed by someone who believed in the healing power of watching confused visitors aimlessly wander around hallways. It didn’t help that all signage in the place had faded, or been stolen, or painted over with graffiti. We came to a “T” in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Which way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I was here earlier I—HEY!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn took off running to his right. I followed, the heavy green mystery box banging off my legs as I ran. I considered dropping the stupid thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? What did you see? John!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe skidded to a stop at the end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw somebody.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it a … person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, in a way that meant he didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you saw them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that an elevator?” It was. Down at the end of the hall. The doors were closed. “Probably no power to it though, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I think you might be wrong. I rode in it. They had me down in the basement for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They did? You didn’t tell me that. What’s down there? Surely nothing worth complaining about, or else you would have brought it up by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t know. They had me knocked out the whole time and then put a bag on my head when they hauled me out to go to quarantine. I don’t want to shake your faith in government but I’m thinking this REPER is kind of a shady operation. Find the stairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to debate getting on the elevator, thanks to rule number one I mentioned just a moment ago. You get on one of those things, and you’re sealed up and somebody else is controlling where you go. All of these rules were learned from terrible experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “Boom. Stairs. Right over there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe jogged toward the stairwell door and at the exact moment John’s hand grabbed the handle, the elevator dinged behind us. We heard the doors slide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind us, a tiny voice said, “Walt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e90 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI very nearly pissed my pants. John saw the look on my face and spun around with the shotgun. He led the way, and we inched toward the now-open elevator. Inside was a little girl. Long, black, straight hair. She wore a filthy nightgown. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-book-is-full-of-spiders-john-dies-at-the-end-2/page-63.html","bookId":2488,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM"}
