All previous occasions seemed skimpy and hollow in comparison. He was utterly delighted with what had happened. Yet he kept quiet. He felt it better not to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen and Dua were happy, too. Tritt could tell. Even the children seemed to be glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tritt was happiest of all - naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened to Odeen and Dua talk. He understood none of it, but that didn\u0027t matter. He didn\u0027t mind that they seemed so pleased with each other. He had his own pleasure and was content to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, on one occasion. \"And do they really try to communicate with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Tritt never got it quite clear who \"they\" might be. He gathered that \"communicate\" was a fancy word for \"talk.\" So why didn\u0027t they say \"talk\"? Sometimes he wondered if he should interrupt. But if he asked questions, Odeen would only say, \"Now, Tritt,\" and Dua would swirl impatiently.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" said Odeen. \"The Hard Ones are quite sure of that. They have markings on the material that is sent us sometimes and they say that it is perfectly possible to communicate by such markings. Long ago, in fact, they used markings in reverse, when it was necessary to explain to the other-beings how to set up their part of the Positron Pump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what the other-beings look like. What do they look like, do you suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the laws we can work out the nature of the stars! because that is simple. But how can we work out the nature of the beings? We can never know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t they communicate what they look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we understood what they communicated, perhaps we could make out something. But we don\u0027t understand.\" Dua seemed aggrieved. \"Don\u0027t the Hard Ones understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. If they do, they haven\u0027t told me so. Losten once told me it didn\u0027t matter what they were like, as long as the Positron Pump worked and was enlarged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he just didn\u0027t want you bothering him.\" Odeen said, huffily. \"I don\u0027t bother him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you know what I mean. He just didn\u0027t want to get into those details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy that time Tritt could no longer listen. They went on arguing for quite awhile over whether the Hard Ones should let Dua look at the markings or not Dua said that she could sense what they said, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made Tritt a little angry. After all, Dua was only a Soft One and not even a Rational. He began to wonder if Odeen was right to tell her all he did. It gave Dua funny ideas -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua could see it made Odeen angry, too. First he laughed. Then he said that an Emotional couldn\u0027t handle such complicated things. Then he refused to talk at all. Dua had to be very pleasant to him for a while till he came around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one occasion it was Dua who was angry - absolutely furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began quietly. In fact, it was on one of the occasions when the two children were with them. Odeen was letting them play with him. He didn\u0027t even mind when little-right Torun pulled at him. In fact, he let himself go in most undignified fashion. He didn\u0027t seem to mind that he was all out of shape. It was a sure sign he was pleased. Tritt remained in a corner, resting, and was so satisfied with what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua laughed at Odeen\u0027s misshapenness. She let her own substance touch Odeen\u0027s knobbishness flirtatiously. She knew very well, Tritt knew, that the leftish surface was sensitive when out of ovoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, \"I\u0027ve been thinking, Odeen . . . If the other Universe gets its laws into ours just a bit through the Positron Pump, doesn\u0027t our Universe get its laws into theirs the same little bit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen howled at Dua\u0027s touch and tried to avoid her without upsetting the little ones. He gasped, \"I can\u0027t answer unless you stop, you mid-ling wretch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, and he said, \"That\u0027s a very good thought, Dua. You\u0027re an amazing creature. It\u0027s true, of course. The mixture goes both ways. . . . Tritt take out the little ones, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they scurried off by themselves. They were not such little ones. They were quite grown. Annis would soon be starting his education and Torun was quite Parentally-blockish already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt stayed and thought Dua looked very beautiful when Odeen talked to her in this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, \"If the other laws slow down our Sun and cool them down; don\u0027t our laws speed up their suns and heat them up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly right, Dua. A Rational couldn\u0027t do better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How hot do their suns get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, not much; just slightly hotter, very slightly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, \"But that\u0027s where I keep getting the something-bad feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, the trouble is that their suns are so huge. H our little suns get a little cooler, it doesn\u0027t matter. Even if they turned off altogether, it wouldn\u0027t matter as long as we have the Positron Pump. With great, huge stars, though, getting even a little hotter is troublesome. There is so much material in one of those stars that turning up the nuclear fusion even a little way will make it explode.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explode! But then what happens to the people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people in the other Universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Odeen looked blank, then he said, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what would happen if our own Sun exploded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It couldn\u0027t explode.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Tritt wondered what all the excitement was about How could a Sun explode? Dua seemed angrier and Odeen looked confused.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, \"But if it did? Would it get very hot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wouldn\u0027t it kill us all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen hesitated and then said in clear annoyance, \"What difference does it make, Dua? Our Sun isn\u0027t exploding, and don\u0027t ask silly questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me to ask questions, Odeen, and it does make a difference, because the Positron Pump works both ways. We need their end as much as ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen stared at her. \"I never told you that\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen said, \"You feel a great many things. Dua - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dua was shouting now. She was quite beside herself. Tritt had never seen her like that She said, \"Don\u0027t change the subject, Odeen. And don\u0027t withdraw and try to make me out a complete fool - just another Emotional. You said I was almost like a Rational and I\u0027m enough like one to see that the Positron Pump won\u0027t work without the other-beings. If the people in the other Universe are destroyed, the Positron Pump will stop and our Sun will be colder than ever and well all starve. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen was shouting too, now. \"That shows what you know. We need their help because the energy supply is in low concentration and we have to switch matter. If the Sun in the other Universe explodes, there\u0027ll be an enormous flood of energy; a huge flood that will last for a million lifetimes. There will be so much energy, we could tap it directly without any matter-shift either way; so we don\u0027t need them, and it doesn\u0027t matter what happens - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were almost touching now. Tritt was horrified. He had better say something, make them get apart, talk to them. He couldn\u0027t think of anything to say. Then it turned out he didn\u0027t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a Hard One just outside the cavern. No, three of them. They had been trying to talk and hadn\u0027t made themselves heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt shrieked, \"Odeen. Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he remained quiet, trembling. He had a frightened notion of what the Hard Ones had come to talk about. He decided to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a Hard One put out one of his permanent, opaque appendages and said, \"Don\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded harsh, unfriendly. Tritt was more frightened than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua was filled with anger; so filled she could scarcely sense the Hard Ones. She seemed stifled under the components of the anger, each one filling her to the brim, separately. There was a sense of wrongness that Odeen should try to lie to her. A sense of wrongness that a whole world of people should die. A sense of wrongness that it was so easy for her to learn and that she had never been allowed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince that first time in the rock, she had gone twice more to the Hard-caverns. Twice more, unnoticed, she had buried herself in rock, and each time she sensed and knew, and each time when Odeen would explain matters to her, she knew in advance what it was he would explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy couldn\u0027t they teach her, then, as they had taught Odeen? Why only the Rationals? Did she possess the capacity to learn only because she was a Left-Em, a perverted mid-ling? Then let them teach her, perversion and all It was wrong to leave her ignorant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the words of the Hard One were breaking through to her. Losten was there, but it was not he speaking. It was a strange Hard One, in front, who spoke. She did not know him, but she knew few of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One said, \"Which of you have been in the lower caverns recently: the Hard caverns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua was defiant. They found out about her rock-rubbing and she didn\u0027t care. Let them tell everybody. She would do so herself. She said, \"I have. Many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\" said the Hard One calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone. Many times,\" snapped Dua. It was only three times, but she didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen muttered, \"I have, of course, been to the lower caverns on occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One seemed to ignore that. He turned to Tritt instead and said sharply. \"And you, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt quavered, \"Yes, Hard-sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Hard-sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How often?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua was annoyed. Poor Tritt was in such a panic over nothing. It was she herself who had done it and she was ready for a confrontation. \"Leave him alone,\" she said. \"I\u0027m the one you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One turned slowly toward her. \"For what?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For whatever it is.\" And faced with it directly, she couldn\u0027t bring herself to describe what she had done after all. Not in front of Odeen;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027ll get to you. First, the right . . . Your name is Tritt, isn\u0027t it? Why did you go to the lower caverns alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To speak to Hard-One-Estwald, Hard-sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt which again Dua interrupted, eagerly, \"Are you Estwald?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One said briefly, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen looked annoyed, as though it embarrassed him that Dua didn\u0027t recognize the Hard One. Dua didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One said to Tritt, \"What did you take from the lower caverns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One said, without emotion, \"We know you took something. We want to know if you know what it was. It could be very dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt was still silent, and Losten interposed, saying more kindly, \"Please tell us, Tritt. We know now it was you and we don\u0027t want to have to be harsh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt mumbled. \"I took a food-ball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" It was the first Hard One speaking. \"What did you do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Tritt burst out. \"It was for Dua. She wouldn\u0027t eat It was for Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua jumped and coalesced in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One turned on her at once. \"You did not know about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor you?\" - to Odeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen, so motionless as to seem frozen, said, \"No, Hard-sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment the air was full of unpleasant vibration as the Hard Ones spoke to each other, ignoring the triad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether her sessions at rock-rubbing had made her more sensitive, or whether it was her recent storm of emotions, Dua couldn\u0027t tell, and wouldn\u0027t have dreamed of trying to analyze; she simply knew she was catching whiffs\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- not of words - but of understanding -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had detected the loss some time ago. They had been searching quietly. They had turned to the Soft Ones as possible culprits with reluctance. They had investigated and then turned to Odeen\u0027s triad with even greater reluctance. (Why? Dua missed that.) They did not see how Odeen could have had the foolishness to take it, or Dua the inclination. They did not think of Tritt at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Hard One who had so far not said a word to the Soft Ones recalled seeing Tritt in the Hard-caverns. (Of course, thought Dua. It was the day she had first entered the rock. She had sensed him then. She had forgotten.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had seemed unlikely in the extreme, but finally, with all else impossible and with the time lapse having grown intolerably dangerous, they came. They would have liked to consult Estwald, but by the time the possibility of Tritt arose, he was unavailable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this Dua sensed in a gasp and now she turned toward Tritt, with a feeling of mingled wonder and outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosten was anxiously vibrating that no harm had been done, that Dua looked well, that it was a useful experiment actually. The Hard One to whom Tritt had spoken was agreeing; the other still exuded concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua was not paying attention to them only. She was looking at Tritt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first Hard One said, \"Where is the food-ball now, Tritt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt showed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hidden effectively and the connections were clumsy but serviceable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One said, \"Did you do this yourself, Tritt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Hard-sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I looked at how it was done in the Hard-caverns. I did it exactly the way I saw it done there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you know you might have harmed your mid-mate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t. I wouldn\u0027t. I - \" Tritt seemed unable to speak for a moment. Then he said, \"It was not to hurt her. It was to feed her. I let it pour into her feeder and I decorated her feeder. I wanted her to try it and she did. She ate! For the first time in a long while she ate well. We melted.\" He paused, then said in a huge, tumultuous cry. \"She had enough energy at last to initiate a baby-Emotional. She took Odeen\u0027s seed and passed it to me. I have it growing inside me. A baby-Emotional is growing inside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua could not speak. She stumbled back and then rushed for the door in so pell-mell a fashion that the Hard Ones could not get out of the way in time. She struck the appendage of the one in front, passing deep into it, and then pulled free with a harsh sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard One\u0027s appendage fell limp and his expression seemed contorted with pain. Odeen tried to dodge around him to follow Dua, but the Hard One said, with apparent difficulty. \"Let her go for now. There is enough harm done. We will take care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4b\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen found himself living through a nightmare. Dua was gone. The Hard Ones were gone. OnlyTritt was still there; silent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could it have happened, Odeen thought in tortured fashion. How could Tritt have found his way alone to the Hard-caverns? How could he have taken a storage battery charged at the Positron Pump and designed to yield radiation in much more concentrated form than Sunlight and dared -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen would not have had the courage to chance it. How could Tritt; stumbling, ignorant Tritt? Or was he unusual, too? Odeen, the clever Rational; Dua, the curious Emotional; and Tritt, the daring Parental?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"How could you do it, Tritt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt retorted hotly. \"What did I do? I fed her. I fed her better than she had ever been fed before. Now we have a baby-Emotional initiated at last. Haven\u0027t we waited long enough? We would have waited forever, if we had waited for Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you understand, Tritt? You might have hurt her. It wasn\u0027t ordinary Sunlight. It was an experimental radiational source that could have been too concentrated to be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re saying, Odeen. How could it do harm? I tasted the kind of food the Hard Ones made before. It tasted bad. You\u0027ve tasted it, too. It tasted just awful and it never hurt us. It tasted so bad, Dua wouldn\u0027t touch it. Then I came on the food-ball. It tasted good. I ate some and it was delicious. How can anything delicious hurt. You see, Dua ate it. She liked it. And it started the baby-Emotional. How can I have done wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen despaired of explaining. He said, \"Dua is going to be very angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll get over it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder. Tritt, she\u0027s not like ordinary Emotionals. That\u0027s what makes her so hard to live with, but so wonderful when we can live with her. She may never want to melt with us again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt\u0027s outline was sturdily plane-surfaced. Then he said, \"Well, what of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of it? You ask. Do you want to give up melting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but if she won\u0027t she won\u0027t. I have my third baby and I don\u0027t care any more. I know all about the Soft Ones in the old days. They used to have two triad-births sometimes. But I don\u0027t care. One is plenty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Tritt, babies aren\u0027t all there is to melting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else? I heard you say once you learned faster after you melted. Then learn slower. I don\u0027t care. I have my third baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen turned away, trembling, and flowed jerkily out of the chamber. What was the use of scolding Tritt? Tritt wouldn\u0027t understand. He wasn\u0027t sure he understood himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the third baby was born, and grown a little, surely there would come a time to pass on. It would be he, Odeen, who would have to give the signal, who would have to say when, and it would have to be done without fear. Anything else would be disgrace, or worse, and yet he could not face it without melting, even now that all three children would have been formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelting, somehow, would eliminate the fear. . . . Maybe it was because melting was like passing on. There was a period of time when you were not conscious, yet it did not hurt. It was like not existing and yet it was desirable. With enough melting, he could gain the courage to pass on without fear and without -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Sun and all the stars, it wasn\u0027t \"passing on.\" Why use that phrase so solemnly? He knew the other word that was never used except by children who wanted to shock their elders somehow. It was dying. He had to get ready to die without fear, and to have Dua and Tritt die with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn\u0027t know how. . . . Not without melting . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4c\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt remained alone in the room, frightened, frightened, but sturdily resolved to remain unmoved. He had his third baby. He could feel it within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all that counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet why, then, deep inside, did he have a stubborn faint feeling that it wasn\u0027t all that counted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua was ashamed almost beyond endurance. It took a long time for her to battle down that shame; battle it down enough to give herself room to think. She had hastened - hastened - moving blindly out and away from the horror of the home-cavern; scarcely caring that she did not know where she was going or even where she was,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was night, when no decent Soft One would be on the surface, not even the most frivolous Emotional. And it would be a considerable time before the Sun rose. Dua was glad. The Sun was food and at the moment, she hated food and what had been done to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was cold, too, but Dua was only distantly aware of it Why should she care about cold, she thought, when she had been fattened in order that she might do her duty - fattened, mind and body. After that, cold and starvation were almost her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw through Tritt. Poor thing; he was so easy to see through; his actions were pure instinct and he was to be praised that he had followed them so bravely. He had come back so daringly from the Hard-caverns with the food-ball (and she - she herself had sensed him and would have known what was happening if Tritt hadn\u0027t been so paralyzed at what he was doing that he had dared not think of it, and if she had not been so paralyzed at what she was doing and at the new depth of sensation it brought her that she would not take care to sense what most she needed to).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt brought it back undetected and had arranged the pitiful booby trap, decorating her feeder to entice her. And she had come back, flushed with awareness of her rock-probing thinness, filled with the shame of it and with pity for Tritt. With all that shame and pity, she ate, and helped initiate birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then she had eaten but sparingly as was her custom and never at the feeder, but then there had been no impulse to. Tritt had not driven her. He had looked contented (of course) so there was nothing to reactivate the shame. And Tritt left the food-ball in place. He didn\u0027t dare risk taking it back; he had what he wanted; it was best and easiest to leave it there and think of it no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Till he was caught. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-15.html","bookId":1744,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM"}
