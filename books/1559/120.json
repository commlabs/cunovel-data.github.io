You can’t stay up all night as if you were a pup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not tired,” Max said. “But you’re right about the other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell Mama.” Valerie crossed to him, stroked where his hair had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just I been remembering, about the pill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a beautiful pill, honey. Feel proud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I messed up the amounts, though. Didn’t they want an hour? When I doubled the recipe, I didn’t do enough. I don’t think it’ll work over forty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie moved into his lap. “Let’s be honest with each other; sure, you’re a genius, but even a genius gets rusty. You were three years out of practice. Forty minutes’ll be plenty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose you’re right. Anyway, what can we do about it? Down is down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pressures you been under, if it works at all, it’ll be a miracle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax had to agree with her. “A fantasmagoria.” He nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black was nearly stiff when Fezzik reached the wall. It was almost five o’clock and Fezzik had been carrying the corpse the whole way from Miracle Max’s, back street to back street, alleyway to alleyway, and it was one of the hardest things he had ever done. Not taxing. He wasn’t even winded. But if the pill was just what it looked like, a chocolate lump, then he, Fezzik, was going to have a lifetime of bad dreams of bodies growing stiff between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he at last was in the wall shadow, he said to Inigo, “What now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got to see if it’s still safe. There might be a trap waiting.” It was the same part of the wall that led, shortly, to the Zoo, in the farthest corner of the castle grounds. But if the albino’s body had been discovered, then who knew what was waiting for them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should I go up then?” Fezzik asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll both do it,” Inigo replied. “Lean him against the wall and help me.” Fezzik tilted the man in black so he was in no danger of falling and waited while Inigo jumped onto his shoulders. Then Fezzik did the climbing. Any crack in the wall was enough for his fingers; the least imperfection was all he needed. He climbed quickly, familiar with it now, and after a moment, Inigo was able to grab hold of the top and say, “All right; go on back down,” so Fezzik returned to the man in black and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo crept along the wall top in dead silence. Far across he could see the castle entrance and the armed soldiers flanking it. And closer at hand was the Zoo. And off in the deepest brush in the farthest corner of the wall, he could make out the still body of the albino. Nothing had changed at all. They were, at least so far, safe. He gestured down to Fezzik, who scissored the man in black between his legs, began the arm climb noiselessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were all together on the wall top, Inigo stretched out the dead man and then hurried along until he could get a better view of the main gate. The walk from the outer wall to the main castle gate was slanted slightly down, not much of an incline, but a steady one. There must be—Inigo did a quick count—at least a hundred men standing at the ready. And the time must be—he estimated closely—five after five now, perhaps close to ten. Fifty minutes till the wedding. Inigo turned then and hurried back to Fezzik. “I think we should give him the pill,” he said. “It must be around forty-five minutes till the ceremony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That means he’s only got fifteen minutes to escape with,” Fezzik said. “I think we should wait until at least five-thirty. Half before, half after.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-120.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
