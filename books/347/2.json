{"id":17863,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II — GRANT MAKES TWO BUSINESS CALLS","content":"\u0026nbsp;Deacon Gridley had a small farm, and farming was his chief occupation, but he had a few thousand dollars laid away in stocks and bonds, and, being a thrifty man, not to say mean, he managed to save up nearly all the interest, which he added to his original accumulation. He always coveted financial trusts, and so it came about that he was parish treasurer. It was often convenient for him to keep in his hands, for a month at a time, money thus collected which ought to have been paid over at once to the minister, but the deacon was a thoroughly selfish man, and cared little how pressed for money Mr. Thornton might be, as long as he himself derived some benefit from holding on to the parish funds. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The deacon was mowing the front yard of his house when Grant came up to his front gate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good-morning, Deacon Gridley,” said the minister\u0027s son.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mornin\u0027, Grant,” answered the deacon. “How\u0027s your folks?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Pretty well in health,” returned Grant, coming to business at once, “but rather short of money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ministers most gen\u0027ally are,” said Deacon Gridley, dryly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should think they might be, with the small salaries they get,” said Grant, indignantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Some of \u0027em do get poorly paid,” replied the deacon; “but I call six hundred dollars a pooty fair income.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It might be for a single man; but when a minister has a wife and three children, like my father, it\u0027s pretty hard scratching.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Some folks ain\u0027t got faculty,” said the deacon, adding, complacently, “it never cost me nigh on to six hundred dollars a year to live.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The deacon had the reputation of living very penuriously, and Abram Fish, who once worked for him and boarded in the family, said he was half starved there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You get your milk and vegetables off the farm,” said Grant, who felt the comparison was not a fair one. “That makes a great deal of difference.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It makes some difference,” the deacon admitted, “but not as much as the difference in our expenses. I didn\u0027t spend more\u0027n a hundred dollars cash last year.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This excessive frugality may have been the reason why Mrs. Deacon Gridley was always so shabbily dressed. The poor woman had not had a new bonnet for five years, as every lady in the parish well knew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ministers have some expenses that other people don\u0027t,” persisted Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What kind of expenses, I\u0027d like to know?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They have to buy books and magazines, and entertain missionaries, and hire teams to go on exchanges.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s something,” admitted the deacon. “Maybe it amounts to twenty or thirty dollars a year.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “More likely a hundred,” said Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That would be awful extravagant sinful waste. If I was a minister, I\u0027d be more keerful.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Deacon Gridley, I don\u0027t want to argue with you. I came to see if you hadn\u0027t collected some money for father. Mr. Tudor has sent in his bill, and he wants to be paid.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much is it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sixty-seven dollars and thirty-four cents.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t tell me!” said the deacon, scandalized. “You folks must be terrible extravagant.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant hardly knew whether to be more vexed or amused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If wanting to have enough to eat is extravagant,” he said, “then we are.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You must live on the fat of the land, Grant.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We haven\u0027t any of us got the gout, nor are likely to have,” answered Grant, provoked. “But let us come back to business. Have you got any money for father?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now it so happened that Deacon Gridley had fifty dollars collected, but he thought he knew where he could let it out for one per cent, for a month, and he did not like to lose the opportunity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m sorry to disappoint you, Grant,” he answered, “but folks are slow about payin\u0027 up, and—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Haven\u0027t you got any money collected?” asked Grant, desperately.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do,” said the deacon, with a bright idea. “I\u0027ve got fifty dollars of my own—say for a month, till I can make collections.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That would be very kind,” said Grant, feeling that he had done the deacon an injustice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course,” the deacon resumed, hastily, “I should have to charge interest. In fact, I was goin\u0027 to lend out the money to a neighbor for a month at one per cent; but I\u0027d just as lieve let your father have it at that price.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Isn\u0027t that more than legal interest?” asked Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, you see, money is worth good interest nowadays. Ef your father don\u0027t want it, no matter. I can let the other man have it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant rapidly calculated that the interest would only amount to fifty cents, and money must be had.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think father\u0027ll agree to your terms,” he said. “I\u0027ll let you know this afternoon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right, Grant. It don\u0027t make a mite of difference to me, but if your father wants the money he\u0027ll have to speak for it to-day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll see that the matter is attended to,” said Grant, and he went on his way, pleased with the prospect of obtaining money for their impoverished household, even on such hard terms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Next he made his way to Mr. Tudor\u0027s store.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was one of those country variety stores where almost everything in the way of house supplies can be obtained, from groceries to dry goods.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Tudor was a small man, with a parchment skin and insignificant features. He was in the act of weighing out a quantity of sugar for a customer when Grant entered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant waited till the shopkeeper was at leisure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you want to see me, Grant?” said Tudor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, Mr. Tudor. You sent over a bill to our house this morning.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you\u0027ve come to pay it. That\u0027s right. Money\u0027s tight, and I\u0027ve got bills to pay in the city.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ve got a little money for you on account,” said Grant, watching Tudor\u0027s face anxiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much?” asked the storekeeper, his countenance changing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Eight dollars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Eight dollars!” ejaculated Tudor, indignantly. “Only eight dollars out of sixty-seven! That\u0027s a regular imposition, and I don\u0027t care ef your father is a minister, I stick to my words.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant was angry, but he remembered his mother\u0027s injunction to restrain his temper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We\u0027d like to pay the whole, Mr. Tudor, if we had the money, and—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think I can trust the whole neighborhood, and only get one dollar in ten of what\u0027s due me?” spluttered Mr. Tudor. “Ministers ought to set a better example.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ministers ought to get better pay,” said Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s plenty don\u0027t get as much as your father. When do you expect to pay the rest, I\u0027d like to know? I s\u0027pose you expect me to go on trustin\u0027, and mebbe six months from now you\u0027ll pay me another eight dollars,” said the storekeeper, with withering sarcasm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I was going to tell you, if you hadn\u0027t interrupted me,” said Grant, “that we should probably have some more money for you to-morrow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Twenty-five dollars,” answered the boy, knowing that part of the money borrowed must go in other quarters. “Will that be satisfactory?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s more like!” said Tudor, calming down. “Ef you\u0027ll pay that I\u0027ll give you a leetle more time on the rest. Do you want anything this mornin\u0027? I\u0027ve got some prime butter just come in.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll call for some articles this afternoon, Mr. Tudor. Here are the eight dollars. Please credit us with that sum.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I\u0027ve accomplished something,” said Grant to himself as he plodded homeward.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82001.html","bookId":347,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:11:52 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:11:52 AM"}
