The day had turned out to be gloriously sunny and warm, an exception to the cool weather May had brought so far. Although her fiancé had assured his mother the sun would shine for their wedding, Alix was pragmatic enough to suggest they rent a large white tent. There was always the chance, she’d joked, that someone else with a connection to the Guy Upstairs had asked for rain to water his crops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” Alix said as she got into the car beside Jordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, yourself.” He leaned over and touched his lips to hers in a casual kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike her, Jordan seemed a lot more relaxed since their confrontation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma’s really excited that we’re coming to visit,” he said as he checked his sideview mirror and merged with the Blossom Street traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t tell her we’re doing yard work, did you?” Once Grandma Turner heard that, Alix was afraid she’d be out digging in the flower beds herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say a word.” He headed for the entrance to the Interstate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Alix laid her head back and closed her eyes. She’d been awake since three that morning, with the same questions chasing around and around in her mind. She’d tried to ignore them, especially those having to do with his mother. “I love you, Jordan,” she said, her eyes still closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any particular reason?” he asked, as if her statement amused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lots. Mostly, I love you for loving me enough to cancel the big wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. That.” His voice fell, and Alix opened her eyes to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it bad?” she asked, biting her lip. It couldn’t be easy for any of his family. Susan was the one on the front lines. The curious questions from relatives and friends would all be directed at her. She was stuck canceling the arrangements, too, since she’d booked most of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom will survive,” Jordan assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does she hate me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix, of course not! She understands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat comment produced an involuntary smile. The one thing Alix had gleaned from their meeting the week before was that Susan Turner most definitely did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrived at Grandma Turner’s house on Star Lake, the sun gleamed on the water and the afternoon was about as lovely as Alix could have hoped for. After greeting them, Jordan’s grandmother insisted on serving them iced tea out by the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought that while I was here I’d mow the lawn,” Jordan told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need to do that. I have a service that comes in every two weeks. I’ve already asked them to make a special trip right before your wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma, we don’t want you to do that,” Alix said. “We’d like to do it for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense,” she said, refusing their offer with an airy wave. “Getting the lawn mowed is the least I can do.” She urged Alix and Jordan to eat more of the oatmeal cookies she’d brought out with the tea. “I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’re holding the wedding here.” She gazed wistfully out at the lake. “I’ve always loved this house. It’ll be wonderful to have all my children and grandchildren together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m happy about it, too,” Jordan said, linking his fingers with Alix’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan had described his visits to the lake when he was a child but Alix didn’t know how much he’d loved his grandmother’s home until she’d suggested getting married here. An elated expression had come over him and he’d immediately agreed it was the perfect place, a perfect solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis close to the lake, Alix could feel a light breeze. She set her iced tea on the round patio table and saw Jordan’s grandmother glancing over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jordan, would you mind bringing me my sweater?” Sarah asked. “It’s hanging on the peg just inside the kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix nodded to Jordan and instead of heading for the house, he went to his car and came back with a white box, tied with a red bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s this?” Grandma Turner asked when he returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little something for you from Alix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix?” Wearing a puzzled look, Grandma Turner turned to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just open it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you be bringing me gifts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that was simple. “Because I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Alix,” the old woman said, sighing. “You’re the best gift I could ever have.” Shaking her head, she added, “I couldn’t ask for a better match for my grandson. I’m so happy for you both.” Her eyes filled with tears, which she blinked rapidly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix struggled not to cry herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open the box before we all start to boo hoo,” Jordan teased, pretending to wipe tears from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix elbowed him in the ribs as his grandmother removed the lid and peeled back the tissue paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix knit it herself,” Jordan explained even before his grandmother had the opportunity to lift the lacy shawl from its box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the prayer shawl I mentioned earlier,” Alix said. “People knit them for other people who are special in their lives or in need of prayer or healing. You listened when I needed a friend and loved me when I didn’t think anyone in this family ever would again.” Alix looked at Jordan, who leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “Those days with you meant a lot to me. I realize you’re not sick or in need of extra prayers, but I did want you to know how much I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Alix.” Grandma Turner breathed her name softly, reverently. “I remember you telling me about the shawl. I don’t believe I’ve ever received anything more precious. All the effort that went into this…I will treasure it for the rest of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix gently, almost ceremoniously, arranged the shawl around the old woman’s shoulders, and they hugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they’d finished their tea, Jordan mowed the lawn over Sarah’s objections and clipped the hedge, while Alix tackled the flower beds, weeding and cultivating the soil. When they were done, she planned to spread beauty bark over the freshly tilled beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This garden used to be the pride of the neighborhood,” Grandma Turner said as she stood beside Alix. “I do what I can now, but it isn’t enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We never had flowers at our house when I was growing up.” Alix kept her voice matter-of-fact. She remembered that the house had gone without more than flowers. Several times it lacked a window and once, the front door. Her mother had thrown a beer bottle at her father, who’d ducked; the bottle had broken the living-room window. Another time, when Alix was around six, her father had kicked in the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix had always envied people who had yards with flowers. Her own yard was an embarrassment, not that Alix spent much time worrying about grass and stuff like that. It was a much higher priority to stay out of range of both her parents when they drank. That was the reason she’d found a safe haven in her bedroom closet, where she’d created her fantasy family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you and Jordan to stay for dinner,” Grandma Turner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think Jordan has any plans. Let me ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan, done with clipping the hedge, drank a second glass of iced tea and then joined Alix in weeding the flower beds. She told him about Sarah’s invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knowing my grandmother, she’s already inside fixing a meal,” he said, moving close enough to kiss Alix’s sweaty neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jordan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like to stay?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’d been so long since they’d spent time together like this. Alix hadn’t fully understood how much strain the wedding had placed on their relationship. Once they’d made the decision to take control of it, the stress was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner was a simple affair of soup and sandwiches, which they ate on the patio facing the lake. Grandma Turner fell asleep soon after Alix had carried the dishes inside. Jordan saw his grandmother into the bedroom and then helped Alix clean up the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not every girl enjoys spending time with a guy’s grandmother,” he said as he took a dish towel from the rack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I was thinking?” Alix murmured, washing by hand the few dishes they’d used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you’re crazy in love with me,” Jordan responded quickly. “In fact, you can’t wait to drag me into your bed and have your way with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix grinned. “Well, other than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me.” He stood behind her and wrapped his arms around her middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just thinking how peaceful it is, being here with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm.” He dropped a kiss on the curve of her neck. “Well, this place isn’t going to be so peaceful on June second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix leaned against him. “Tell me the truth—has it been a problem for you at church?” She guessed that Susan’s concerns about what this might do to Jordan’s career were valid. Changing the wedding to a small, private affair so close to the date was likely to cause speculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some,” Jordan admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. “Pastor Downey, my dad and I had a heart-to-heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix wasn’t sure what that entailed nor was she sure it was her business to ask. She waited for Jordan to volunteer the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a brief silence he sighed and released her, then rested against the kitchen counter. “Dad asked me if I’d gotten you pregnant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” she exploded, and watched as a grin spread slowly across Jordan’s face. “Did he really ask you that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.” Jordan nodded. “And I enjoyed telling him I looked forward to doing exactly that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d talked about starting a family but not for several years. “Your mother put him up to it, didn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan shrugged. “I assume so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix knew she faced some damage control with Susan Turner. As soon as the wedding was over, she’d begin to repair their relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, it’s a good thing Pastor Downey, Dad and I talked,” Jordan went on to tell her. “We don’t do that enough. Male bonding.” He pounded his chest in a Tarzan imitation. “Me like bonding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes, loving him all the more for making a joke of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all felt better afterward,” Jordan said in his normal voice, “and I have you to thank for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix hoped it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Jacqueline and Reese?” Jordan asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix assured him they were fine. The funny part was, neither Jacqueline nor Reese seemed especially upset about the wedding plans being overturned. If anything, Reese found his wife’s wedding fixation rather comical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Alix had suspected, it all went back to Paul and Tammie Lee’s wedding. To Jacqueline’s horror, not only hadn’t she been included, she hadn’t even been invited. She’d felt cheated, and as a result, she’d turned Alix and Jordan’s wedding into a substitute—and then some. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/back-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-4/page-41.html","bookId":1936,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:25 AM"}
