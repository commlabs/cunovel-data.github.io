Things changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lost track of each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life happens, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds to me like the two of you did more than just drift apart.\" She carried the plates past him into the living room. \"Today I got the impression that there\u0027s some serious tension between you two. Did something happen to cause it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yesterday\u0027s news.\" He prowled after her and settled into a chair near the window. His expression made it clear that he was about to change the topic. \"How are things going with the Children\u0027s Art Show project?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it wasn\u0027t as though she had any right to push him for answers to questions she\u0027d had no business asking in the first place, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him her brightest smile and sank down onto the arm of the sofa. The embroidered hem of her long white skirt drifted around her ankles. Swinging one foot lightly, she took a fortifying sip of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" she said, lowering her glass. \"I\u0027m quite pleased. I think I\u0027m going to have nearly a hundred entries. Not bad for a small town like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He stole a glance at her gently swinging ankle. \"Not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe casual thing worked right up until the full fury of the storm struck land. She was washing the last of the dishes when the lights flickered twice and went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden onslaught of darkness paralyzed her briefly. Her hands stilled in the soapy water. \"Oh, damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy,\" Nick said from somewhere nearby. \"We lose power all the time around here during big storms. Don\u0027t suppose you have an emergency generator?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flashlight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat. \"Well, yes, as it happens, I do have a flashlight. A nice, big red one with a special high-intensity bulb and an easy-grip handle that I bought last winter after a major storm. It is a model of cutting-edge, modern technology. So powerful that it can be used to signal for help if one happens to be lost at sea or on a mountain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sense a but coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I forgot to buy some batteries for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly in the darkness and came to stand directly behind her. \"Spoken like a real city girl. Don\u0027t worry about it, I\u0027ve got a flashlight in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow that doesn\u0027t surprise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put out his hands and gripped the tiled counter edge on either side of her body. In the shadows she was intensely aware of the heat of his body so close to hers. There was suddenly so much electricity being generated both outside and inside the cottage that she was amazed the lights did not come back on. Probably ought to get her hands out of the dishwater, she thought. A woman could have a major household accident in a situation like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick put his lips very close to her ear. \"I was a Boy Scout. You know what that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to do with being thrifty and neat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong.\" He grazed her earlobe with his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to do with getting to wear a cute uniform?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try again.\" He touched his mouth to her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to do with always keeping spare batteries on hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re getting closer. Much closer.\" He kissed her throat. \"Something to do with always being prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\" She yanked her hands out of the sudsy water and grabbed a dishtowel. \"I\u0027ve heard about the always being prepared thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tightened the cage of his body around her so that her backside was nestled snugly into his thighs. She realized at once that he was aroused. Her senses registered that information and responded with a shot of adrenaline. Her pulse raced. There was a faint trembling in her fingertips. Not fear, she thought. Excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take the motto seriously.\" He brushed his lips along the curve of her throat just below her earlobe. \"And not just when it comes to things like flashlight batteries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was abruptly grateful for the inky shadows of the kitchen. At least he could not see the flush of heat that was surely setting fire to her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You taste good,\" he whispered. \"Better than those little raspberry things we had for dessert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a new, rougher edge in his voice and she was the cause. All that was female in her rejoiced. Outside, the wind howled. Here in the dark kitchen, power flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her throat again, his mouth gliding up along the underside of her jaw. She reveled in the intense pleasure and the heady rush of anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was why she had tried to keep her distance, she remembered. This was precisely the reason she had been so careful these past few weeks, why she had worked so hard to find so many excuses to decline his invitations. She had known it would be like this: dangerous and unpredictable and very high risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd also incredibly exhilarating and intoxicating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have felt her body\u0027s response because he shifted again, pressing closer still until she could feel him, hard and muscled, along the full length of her own much softer frame. The contrast thrilled her senses. The mysteries of yin and yang in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no room to move now inside the cage he had made for her. He had enclosed her in a seductive snare she had no desire to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn urgent, drawing sensation traveled up the insides of her legs and pooled in her lower body. She dropped the dishtowel and clutched at the counter edge for support. Her head tipped back against his shoulder. She savored the strength and power in him and told herself that she would not give in to the almost overwhelming urge to purr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to need that flashlight for a while,\" he whispered. \"We can do this in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of the counter and put his hands on her at last. His fingers closed around her, spinning her toward him. He pulled her fiercely into his arms. His mouth closed over hers with the inevitability of the steel door of a bank vault slamming shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wild chaos of the storm outside was suddenly swirling here in her tiny kitchen. One glorious rush after another swept through her, leaving her trembling with need and anticipation. She wanted him, she thought. She needed this night with Nick. She owed this to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost laughed aloud. Was she good at rationalizing, or what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to let me in on the joke?\" he asked into her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, this is no joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arms around his neck and kissed him with all of the searing, pent-up hunger and desire that had been making her so restless these past few weeks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-24.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
