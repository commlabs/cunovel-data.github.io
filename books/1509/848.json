Their alliance had been stuck under the thumb of the North for years, waiting for the opportunity to rise above their oppressors in a single brilliant move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why although Middle Heaven already proved its might several times over in battles past, it still had more surprises in store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Terminal Ray was nothing short of devastating. Lan Qing’s plan had been to save revealing it for a surprise attack on the alien home worlds! Now, though, his target was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat relatively insignificant line followed in the wake of Poseidon’s Soft Water explosions. However the burning trail it blazed was not pointed at the Violet Prince or Princess. Jue Di had explained to Lan Qing that the connection between them and the home worlds was exceedingly close. There existed the possibility they would be teleported to safely if their lives were threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA weapon that could kill an Infinite-level alien could still be resisted for a time. At least long enough for the home worlds to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTerminal Ray was a danger, but also a great burden on Middle Heaven.

Unlike Terminator’s shot, which went on for a time, Terminal Ray was gone in a blink.

Then, fleck by fleck, the avatars crumbled away and spread out through space as a fine ash.

A single shot and not only had he reduced the number of his powerful adversaries, but also terrified them. He wanted them to know they weren’t invincible.
