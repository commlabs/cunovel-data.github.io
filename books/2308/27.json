Putting the gear shift in park, she slipped out of her gown, wondering how she\u0027d turn the engine off without the key. Tearing the flimsy garment into strips, she bandaged Alex\u0027s arm, then made a thick pad and pressed it over the wound in his shoulder, tying it in place with another strip of cloth. That done, she removed the heavy collar and chain from his neck and tossed them out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt Alex\u0027s forehead, wondering if it felt hotter than usual. Fumbling on the dash, she turned on the heater, then put the truck in gear and pulled onto the narrow two-lane road once more. She drove with no destination in mind. She didn\u0027t know where they were, didn\u0027t know where to go for help. She couldn\u0027t go home, even if she knew which direction to go, couldn\u0027t check Alex into a hospital even if she could find one. The road was deserted. Not so much as a gas station or a telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe imagined pulling into a gas station and asking for help, grimacing as she pictured the reception they\u0027d get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered turning around. Maybe there was a town behind her. Maybe she should try and find a cop. Too bad she didn\u0027t know where to find a donut shop, or a police station. She felt a bubble of hysterical laughter rise in her throat as she pictured herself walking into some small-town precinct, stark naked, and telling them that she had escaped from a mad doctor who wanted to get rich selling alien blood to wealthy sick people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to rouse Alex, but he was unconscious. Or dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! She put her hand over his heart, relieved by the faint but steady rise and fall of his chest. He was alive, thank God. Not knowing where else to turn, she murmured a prayer, begging for help, for a place to hide until Alex was better. She was hungry and tired and afraid, so afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as if in answer to her prayer, she saw a rustic cabin off the side of the road. In the moonlight, it looked like a fairy-tale cottage. Snow White\u0027s house, she thought, or maybe Piglet\u0027s. It was a pretty little place, located on the edge of a small lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Lord.\" She whispered the words over and over again as she pulled off the road, put the truck in park, and set the brake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the door, she slipped out of the truck and went to look in one of the windows. Shivering with the cold, she walked around the cabin. She found a note on the front door. Ripping it free, she carried it back to the truck, squinting to read it in the headlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy, Tried to get hold of you, but you\u0027d already left. Something came up at work and I had to go back to the city. Stay if you want. Will call you next weekend. Randy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow that, was another scrawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy, Sorry we missed each other. Call me at work next Friday. Phil\u0027s getting suspicious. Will call you before then if I can. Love, Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrumpling the note in her hand, Karatried the door. It was locked. She frowned for a moment, then ran her hand over the ledge above the door. Nothing. She glanced at the flower pot sitting on the porch, then grinnedas she lifted it and found a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Randy,\" she murmured. Unlocking the door, she stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a quaint little one-room cabin, the perfect place for a rendezvous. There was no phone, no electricity, a single window that overlooked the lake. A Coleman stove stood on a small square table; there was a box of groceries on the sink top. She poked inside, finding a loaf of French bread, mayonnaise and mustard, apples, oranges, bananas, paper plates and cups, a bottle of rum. An ice chest revealed a carton of milk, a couple of steaks, some lunch meat and a variety of cheeses. There was also a six-pack of beer, and a two-liter bottle of 7-Up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of sleeping bags were spread in front of the fireplace; there was a good-sized pile of wood on the hearth, a box of matches on the mantel, and a Coleman lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleased that Lucy had decided not to stay at the cabin without Randy, and grateful that she hadn\u0027t gone inside and seen the groceries, Kara murmured another prayer of thanks, then hurried outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex lay across the seat, his eyes closed, his breathing rapid and shallow. He\u0027d told her once that he\u0027d never been sick, that he had always recovered quickly when he was hurt. She wondered if his body\u0027s ability to heal itself included gunshot wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex? Alex, wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyelids fluttered open and he stared at her, his gaze unfocused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to get up. I\u0027ve found a place to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, groaning softly as he sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The engine,\" she said. \"Can you turn it off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunting softly, Alex reached under the dash and disconnected the wires. The sudden silence seemed deafening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your arm around my shoulder,\" Kara said. \"It\u0027s not far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t argue. Kara groaned as she shouldered some of his weight. Mercy, but he was heavy! One step at a time, they made it into the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara helped Alex get settled on one of the sleeping bags, then went to close and lock the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was surprised and relieved to find the cabin had running water and clean towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the bile rise in her throat as she began to wash the blood from Alex\u0027s shoulder. The bullet hole was small and ugly, and it didn\u0027t go all the way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex? Alex, what should I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the bloody hole in his shoulder. \"Now might be a good time for one of us to faint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Mind if I go first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare faint on me!\" The wound continued to ooze blood and she pressed the cloth against it in an effort to stop the bleeding. \"I don\u0027t think the wound in your arm is too serious, but your shoulder ... I think the bullet\u0027s still in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re right.\" He dragged a knuckle over her cheek. \"Think you can get it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do it if you\u0027re not up to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been shot before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once, a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Dakotas.\" Alex frowned, remembering. \"You\u0027ve heard of Custer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was fighting with the Cheyenne. Beautiful people, the Cheyenne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Cheyenne? You were fighting on the side of the Cheyenne at the Little Big Horn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a fight. Custer was an idiot to divide his troops the way he did.\" He grimacedas pain surged through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Kara asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I missed the main battle, of course, but there was still some fighting going on after dark. I was prowling around the hill where Reno and some of his men were holed up when I took a bullet in my leg. I dug it out myself. I don\u0027t recommend it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Kara muttered dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mentioned the battle so casually, a battle that had taken place a hundred and twenty years ago. She looked into his eyes, trying to imagine the life he\u0027d led. America was an infant when compared to most of the countries of the world, and Alex had been here almost from the beginning. Sometimes she forgot how old he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it.\" She spent the next few minutes looking for something to use as a probe, finally settling on a thin-bladed knife she found in a drawer. She heated it over the Coleman stove, then rinsed it with rum. \"Maybe you\u0027d like a drink of this?\" she suggested, offering him the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Alex lifted the bottle and took a long swallow. \"Not bad.\" He looked at the knife, at the way it shook in her hand, and grinned. \"Maybe youshould have a drink. Might steady your nerves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara took the bottle and stared at it. She\u0027d never been much of a drinker, but she took several long swallows, felt the expensive liquor slide smoothly down her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready, doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara nodded, and Alex lay back on the sleeping bag, his hands clenched. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more drink. A deep breath, and she was ready. She\u0027d seen it done in living color in movies,\u0027 read about it, and still she wasn\u0027t prepared for the blood, the feel of the knife slipping into flesh. Once, Alex took hold of her hand, steadying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a triumphant gasp when the tip of the knife hit the bullet. Moments later, the slug lay in her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Alex, looked at the bloody chunk of lead in her hand, and knew she was going to faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex caught her before she hit the floor. Feeling a little light-headed himself, he covered Kara with the sleeping bag, then rose, unsteadily, to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking up a clean washrag, he doused it with rum, swore a violent oath as he pressed the cloth over the wound in his shoulder. He rigged a bandage by tearing a white cotton dish towel into strips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAware of the approaching dawn, he stretched out beside Kara and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke abruptly, his gaze drawn to the bright light filtering through the thin curtain. He couldn\u0027t endure the sun, not now, not after all the blood he\u0027d lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara.\" He shook her shoulder. \"Kara, wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The window. Cover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" She blinked at him for a moment; then, as comprehension dawned, she scrambled out of the sleeping bag, picked it up, and draped it over the curtain rod. \"Is that better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing the room, she knelt beside him. The bandage on his shoulder was stained with blood. The material looked very white against his bronzed skin. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but how do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should eat something. And drink plenty of water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. You need to rebuild your strength. You rest, and I\u0027ll fix breakfast. French toast okay with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved my life again,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe basked in the love shining in his eyes, wishing he wasn\u0027t hurt,that they could spend the day making love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe tomorrow,\" Alex said, his voice low and husky, his eyes dark with promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara felt her cheeks grow hot. \"You\u0027re reading my mind again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was slow and lazy and not the least bit guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara\u0027s cheeks grew hotter. \"I\u0027d better fix breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slept all that day, leaving Kara to wander around the small cabin. She found a blue-and-yellow sundress in a box next to the stove and put it on. It was a trifle large, but it beat running around naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate in the afternoon, she went outside and sat in the sun. Head back, she gazed out at the lake, her mind wandering. Her first thoughts were for Gail and Nana. What had Barrett done with them? Were they home, waiting for her, or_good Lord, what if they were locked up in the same building where she and Alex had been held? And what about Barrett? Was he looking for her even now? Had Alex killed Handeland? Was she ever going to have a normal life again? If she left the state and changed her name, would she be able to get on with her life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the sun set in a splash of orange and ocher. It was so peaceful here, she mused, so quiet, while her whole life was in constant turmoil. Once, after watching a James Bond movie, she had wished for a little excitement in her life. Well, she\u0027d found it. In spades. She pressed a hand to her head, feeling a headache coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she felt Alex\u0027s hand on her shoulder. He knelt behind her, his fingers massaging away the pain, his presence driving away her doubts. With a soft sigh, she closed her eyes and gave herself over to the wonder of his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm, yes. Alex, I\u0027ve got to go home. I\u0027ve got to find out what happened to Nana and Gail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came around to sit beside her and she studied his face. He looked better. The dark smudges were gone from his eyes, the lines of strain and weariness had almost disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where they are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I overheard Barrett ask Kelsey if they\u0027d been found yet. I think they managed to get away. I\u0027m sure they\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara relaxed, her worries for her sister and grandmother somewhat alleviated by Alex\u0027s assurance that they had escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex caressed her back and shoulders. Her skin was smooth and soft and warm beneath his fingers. Her hair smelled of sunshine. Bending forward, he pressed his lips to her shoulder. Clad in the colorful sundress, with her hair tumbling down her back, she looked young and innocent and as vulnerable as a newborn kitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex swore under his breath. She should have been home with her family, looking after her sister and her grandmother, dating a man who could give her children. Instead, she was here, with a man who had brought her nothing but trouble. She\u0027d probably lost her job. Her life was in danger. She had no idea where her family was, or when she\u0027d ever be able to go home. And itwas all his fault. His hand stilled, his fingers resting lightly on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara turned her head so she could see Alex\u0027s face, the smile dying on her lips when she saw his expression. \"What is it? What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lying.\" She met his gaze, her eyes narrowing as she tried to read his mind. After a moment, she frowned. Why couldn\u0027t she read his thoughts as she usually did? And then she realized that he had erected a barrier of some kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not fair,\" she said, her voice thick with accusation. \"You read my thoughts whenever you wish. I should be able to do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life is unfair, Kara.\" He lifted his hand from her shoulder and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stared at him. He was naked save for a towel wrapped around his waist. A faint breeze blew over the lake, ruffling his hair. The setting sun left its signature across the sky in bold strokes of crimson and ocher, casting his figure in shades of gold and bronze. He looked like the Greek god Apollo, she thought, strong and handsome and possessed of remarkable powers. She tried again to read his thoughts, and again she couldn\u0027t penetrate the wall he had erected between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she stood up. She willed him to turn around, to acknowledge her, to confide in her. She ached to go to him, to take him in her arms and tell him she loved him. Instead, she crossed her arms over her breasts and attempted to shield her own thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes passed, and still he stood there with his back toward her. Her patience at an end, Kara turned on her heel and walked back to the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made dinner because she needed something to do. They had been so close only a short time ago. High on a mountaintop, they had exchanged vows to love and cherish each other. They had made love, their joining more than just physical intercourse. And now it felt as though they were hundreds of miles apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen dinner was ready, she started for the door to call him, only to find him standing there, his dark eyes filled with unbearable sorrow. She wondered how long he had been there, and what he was thinking to make him look so sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" she said. \"Supper\u0027s ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, he took a place at the table. She\u0027d fixed steak and eggs. His steak was rare, just the way he liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate in silence. Kara refused to meet his gaze, and he ached for the pain he had caused her, was causing her even now, and yet he said nothing. He\u0027d known all along it had been wrong for him to interfere in her life. For two hundred years, he had carefully avoided attachments to humans. It was time to end his relationship with Kara before it was too late, before he ruined her life completely, or got her killed. He could not endure the guilt of knowing his mere presence put her life in jeopardy, could not have her death on his hands. Somehow, he would get her safely home, reunite her with her family. And if he had to kill Barrett to accomplish it, then he would do so without a qualm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising from the table, he thanked her for the meal, then crawled into the sleeping bag and closed his eyes. Leaving her wouldnot be easy for either of them. She might miss him for a time. She might even hate him. But someday, when she had a husband and children and a normal life, she would thank him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-27.html","bookId":2308,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:00 PM"}
