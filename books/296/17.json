He took the bills into his hand, and looked over them. His hands trembled a little, for he contemplated a dishonest act.

Then, opening his desk, he took out a sheet of paper, and wrote a note to the address given in his lottery circular, requesting the parties to send him by return of mail a lottery ticket. He added, shrewdly as he thought,[Pg 151] \"If this ticket draws a prize, I will keep on buying; but if it don\u0027t I shall get discouraged and stop.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess that\u0027ll fetch \u0027em,\" thought Joshua.

The postmaster in a small village can generally identify many of the correspondents who send letters through his office by their handwriting. He knew Joshua\u0027s, and such a letter as this would attract his attention and set him to gossiping. Considering the circumstances under which he obtained the money, this was hardly desirable, and Joshua therefore decided, though unwillingly, on account of the trouble, to walk to the next post-office, a distance of three miles, and post his letter there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He came downstairs with his letter in his pocket. \"Where are you going, Joshua?\" asked his mother.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Going out to walk,\" said Joshua, shortly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 152]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wanted to send a little bundle to Mr. Faulkner\u0027s, but that is too far off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll carry it,\" said Joshua.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Drummond was astonished at this unusual spirit of accommodation, for Joshua was, in general, far from obliging.
