If just the start is like this, then the intensity of the forces ahead could be imagined! No wonder Senior Xiao Daochild said that even though numerous direct disciples of Empyrean Vast Universe had climbed up the Divine Seal Altar, none of them had managed to mount the summit in over 2 million years.

However, the energies contained within this power of divinity were simply too wild and crazy.

That height was abnormally difficult. It would be impossible for Lin Ming or Dragon Fang to climb up that high.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo the side of Empyrean Vast Universe, Empyrean Divine Dream exhaled a light breath.

Although it is only 10%, it is still not something that a Divine Sea realm martial artist can climb. Dragon Fang can use these little tricks now, but he cannot do so forever. There is a chance that he can climb up 70,000-80,000 feet, and Lin Ming is also the same. But for him to resist the power of divinity in this manner is impossible for the final several tens of thousands of feet. The only possibility would be if he made another breakthrough at that time. Still, I cannot imagine why Lin Ming can sense the 33 Layered Heavens Laws. I even suspect that Lin Ming might have obtained a Concept inheritance related to the 33 Layered Heavens ancient Divine Seal Altar.
