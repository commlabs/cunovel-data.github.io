Kate felt the laws of the universe bend out of true. This was how it was in the Royal Presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcello noticed her hesitation. They held up traffic. A press of guests built outside the doors, like the fizz behind a champagne cork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey popped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuests flowed through the corridors of the palazzo, pulsing in organ-like chambers, throbbing toward the heart. The vaulted ballroom was immense, and crowded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in the grip of red thirst. Everyone here, living and dead, was a sack of blood. She\u0027d gone beyond being glutted by Marcello, and was on the fringe of mania. She\u0027d seen other vampires in this state, but never been here herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t so bad from the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes must have been glowing scarlet, enlarged by her specs. Her teeth were daggers, her fingernails talons. She was a bit of a dragon herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orchestra played \u0027Dracula Cha Cha Cha\u0027. His Majesty\u0027s subjects danced, trailing black and red velvet across a polished mosaic floor. Black ostrich plumes bobbed like insect antennae above elaborate headdresses. Red jewels sparkled with firelight. White faces glowed like stains in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was entranced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Let\u0027s dance,\u0027 she said to Marcello, taking his arm and stepping onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easy to surrender to the music. Marcello kept up with her, warily. He was blank behind his dark glasses, but she owned him entirely. She had made of him a slave, like that poor mad fellow Jack Seward had been treating in 1885. Renfield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...he killed the flies to catch the spiders, he killed the spiders to catch the birds, he killed the birds to catch the cats...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDancing was like feeding, drinking the music. All around, in the throng, were creatures like herself. Stiff-haired muzzles, bestial paws with lace cuffs, rotted fangs with gold dental work, leathery wings freed by backless gowns, red eyes lined with blue shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were Dracula\u0027s guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prince himself did not need to be in the room. He was not a creature of the heart. He would be below them somewhere, in the earth. At the climax of the evening, he would rise to be with his subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey danced past people she knew. Genevieve was in a corner, warily flirting with a handsome vampire Brit who had been at Charles\u0027s funeral. Penelope was snatching a quick ciggy, looking as fraught as a nanny whose charges are running wild. Kate found that amusing: She had often had to look after little Penny, the pretty terror. The only way Penelope could grow up was if everyone else turned back into children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrson Welles was sawing a Czechoslovakian blonde in half with a sword, keeping up a constant light patter as he levered the silvered blade through her lovely stomach. Inspector Silvestri and Sergeant Ginko, dressed as waiters, kept an eye out for threats to vampire elders, warm plods laughably employed to protect the most dangerous group of people in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught the rhythm at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrac-u-la, Drac-u-la, Dra... cha cha cha...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Merrin, in simple robes with a prominent pectoral cross, observed the throng with more pity than disapproval. And, good God, there was that rogue Sebastian Villanueva. He was supposed to be in Star City, dreaming up rocket weapons. If Villanueva was even tentatively in the West, that was a story. She should find a telephone and call her editor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she was dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrac-u-la, Drac-u-la...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, she didn\u0027t care about news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...Dra... cha cha cha...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe writhed close to Marcello, elbows on his shoulders, longfingered hands teasing his lightly-oiled hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrac-u-la, Drac-u-la, Dra... cha cha cha...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licked her mouth, feeling the rough of her tongue on her full lips. She stuck out her tongue and touched her nose with the pointed tip. The trick had sometimes delighted Penny enough to distract her from mischief. She had enjoyed laughing at poor, staid old Kate. Marcello didn\u0027t so much as flinch a smile. To him, dancing was a serious business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrac-u-la, Drac-u-la, Dra... cha cha cha...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled around, hips punctuating the dance with precise cha cha cha thrusts, and stuck her tongue out at Penelope\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who was bad-temperedly stubbing her cigarette on a waiter\u0027s hand\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then exploded with the giggles. Marcello kept her upright, and she let the music take over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t remember Charles ever dancing. She had seen him fence, though. He was light-footed and imaginative. He would have been a fine dancer. Perhaps it was just that he\u0027d never danced with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe missed a step. Damn. Always, she was bothered by ghosts. It was absurd. A vampire should trump a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong so many hypnotic elder stares, she spotted kindly blue eyes of warm wisdom. Merrin. He watched her, feeling for her. He had no right. She was a monster. She needed no sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thumb-talon, she slit open Marcello\u0027s neck. She craned to catch the spurt in her mouth, and sucked back the blood, feeling it bursting behind her eyes. Electric taste wiped away what she had been thinking of, worrying about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcello wasn\u0027t dancing. He was spasming in her arms, too much blood pouring from his depleted veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscreet footmen stepped onto the floor and took Marcello from her. One slapped a large sticking-plaster over the wound and said something in Italian about Vimto. They took him away from her as if taking a broken toy from an unruly child, careful not to express disapproval but nevertheless clearly miffed by her heedlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the servants indicated his chin. It took her a moment to realise what he meant. She took her hankie and wiped away an obstinate trickle of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcello was walked toward an alcove. As the curtain whisked aside, she glimpsed a row of beds and a stand of drip-feeds. Nurses were in attendance. She was not the only vampire to lose self-control under the influence of the cha cha cha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a lone woman, she was suddenly open season. General Iorga, a tubby elder who\u0027d been head of the Carpathian Guard when they were sworn to cut off her head, tried to whirl her in a gavotte. The General lost her to a beatnik bleeder with a beret and a goatee who jerked her back into cha cha cha-mode. An amulet on a long chain danced between them, thumping against his black pullover and her decolletage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was torn from the Maynard G. Krebs-type by a woman elder who took advantage of a momentary slowing of the music to French-kiss her. As an alien tongue probed her mouth for licks of Marcello\u0027s blood, Kate realised this was the strangest of all elders, Casanova. Upon turning, he\u0027d shape-shifted permanently into a woman, a miracle which had no effect whatsoever on his character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was detached from the great lover, a process that involved much unlocking of mouth-parts, by a ravaged, bloated warm fellow whom she recognised, under many layers of dissolution, as Errol Flynn. The former matinee idol had a spigot in his neck. Kate could not resist the blood of Robin Hood. It was more vodka than gore, but rich with Caribbean spices and gunpowder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left Flynn, and stumbled, drunk in several ways, through the crowds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge chest blocked her way. She raised her head to look at the face, but it was a crimson blur. The man wore tights that showed thick columns of muscle in his thighs and calves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold cloth dropped on her brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere were Silvestri and Ginko? Where were the Carpathian Guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFright seized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes focused. She had been mistaken. This was not the Crimson Executioner. A bespectacled, handsome, kindly face, built of solid blocks, looked down at her. It was an actor, Kent. She\u0027d seen pictures of him as Hercules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t even dressed in red. His tights were blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you all right, Miss?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved him away, trying to make a sober arrangement of her features. He wasn\u0027t sure about her, but took her reassurance as authentic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the muscled American, she glimpsed a smaller figure. A tiny woman, or a child. A wing of blonde hair over one eye. She\u0027d been wrong about the Crimson Executioner, but this was the little girl from Piazza di Trevi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Excuse me,\u0027 she said to Kent, brushing past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Kate wanted to cry. She knew she was in a dulled, insensate state. She wanted to be sharp, wanted to be herself. She needed herself now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red ball bounced on the floor and rolled to her feet. She bent to pick up the plaything, but clumsily tapped it. The ball leaped like a balloon, and hopped away like a Chinese vampire. It bounced off Private Elvis Presley\u0027s head and against Edgar Poe\u0027s chest, making the writer spill his drink, then loped onwards, sliding between Gina Lollobrigida and an elder Kate didn\u0027t know. It was as if it were trying to escape. Kate kept her eye on the ball, and followed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-20.html","bookId":2295,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM"}
