{"id":44696,"no":30,"title":"6.30, Saturday","content":"Dear Daddy,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We started to walk to town today, but mercy! how it poured. \n\u003cbr\u003e I like winter to be winter with snow instead of rain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia\u0027s desirable uncle called again this afternoon--and brought\n\u003cbr\u003e a five-pound box of chocolates. There are advantages, you see,\n\u003cbr\u003e about rooming with Julia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited for a later\n\u003cbr\u003e train in order to take tea in the study. We had an awful lot of\n\u003cbr\u003e trouble getting permission. It\u0027s hard enough entertaining fathers\n\u003cbr\u003e and grandfathers, but uncles are a step worse; and as for brothers\n\u003cbr\u003e and cousins, they are next to impossible. Julia had to swear\n\u003cbr\u003e that he was her uncle before a notary public and then have the\n\u003cbr\u003e county clerk\u0027s certificate attached. (Don\u0027t I know a lot of law?)\n\u003cbr\u003e And even then I doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean\n\u003cbr\u003e had chanced to see how youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, we had it, with brown bread Swiss cheese sandwiches. \n\u003cbr\u003e He helped make them and then ate four. I told him that I had\n\u003cbr\u003e spent last summer at Lock Willow, and we had a beautiful gossipy\n\u003cbr\u003e time about the Semples, and the horses and cows and chickens. \n\u003cbr\u003e All the horses that he used to know are dead, except Grover,\n\u003cbr\u003e who was a baby colt at the time of his last visit--and poor Grove\n\u003cbr\u003e now is so old he can just limp about the pasture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue\n\u003cbr\u003e plate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantry--and they do! \n\u003cbr\u003e He wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck\u0027s hole under the pile\n\u003cbr\u003e of rocks in the night pasture--and there is! Amasai caught a big,\n\u003cbr\u003e fat, grey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson\n\u003cbr\u003e of the one Master Jervis caught when he was a little boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I called him `Master Jervie\u0027 to his face, but he didn\u0027t appear\n\u003cbr\u003e to be insulted. Julia says she has never seen him so amiable;\n\u003cbr\u003e he\u0027s usually pretty unapproachable. But Julia hasn\u0027t a bit of tact;\n\u003cbr\u003e and men, I find, require a great deal. They purr if you rub them the\n\u003cbr\u003e right way and spit if you don\u0027t. (That isn\u0027t a very elegant metaphor. \n\u003cbr\u003e I mean it figuratively.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027re reading Marie Bashkirtseff\u0027s journal. Isn\u0027t it amazing? \n\u003cbr\u003e Listen to this: `Last night I was seized by a fit of despair\n\u003cbr\u003e that found utterance in moans, and that finally drove me to throw\n\u003cbr\u003e the dining-room clock into the sea.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It makes me almost hope I\u0027m not a genius; they must be very wearing\n\u003cbr\u003e to have about--and awfully destructive to the furniture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mercy! how it keeps Pouring. We shall have to swim to chapel tonight.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59752.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
