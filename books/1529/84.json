He already had his letter of resignation in his pocket. When he had returned from Cambodia, he had found his father in the hospital, his chest burned from Taser strikes. His mothers arm was in a sling from a minor fracture to her wrist. The worst was his mother\u0027s black eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll because of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had almost lost it in the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat security could he offer his parents if he continued? The Guild certainly knew who he was, where to find his folks. The only way to keep them safe was to resign. Painter tried to assure him that the Guild would back off. That retribution and retaliation were not their methods. In future missions, Painter had assured Gray his parents would be secured before he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut some missions came crashing up your driveway in a motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to plan against that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gray,\" his father pressed, \"what you do is important. You can\u0027t let worries about us stop you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his hand. \"I\u0027ve said my peace. You make your own decision. I have to figure out if I like these rims or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray started to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father reached out, grabbed his shoulder, and pulled him into a one-armed hug. He gave him one squeeze—then pushed him away a bit. \"Go see what your mother is burning for breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray crossed to the back door and met his mother coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Gray, I just got off the phone with Kat. She said you were heading over there this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before I go to the office. I have some of Monk\u0027s stuff on the front porch. Dad\u0027s letting me borrow the T-bird so I can run some errands for Kat this afternoon, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the funeral isn\u0027t for another two days, but I have some pies. Could you take those over, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pies?\" Gray asked doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I bought them from the bakery down the street. Oh, and I have some toys for Penelope. I found this cute jumper with elephants and . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just kept nodding, knowing eventually his mother would stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is Kat holding up?\" she finally finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shook his head. \"Good days and bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother sighed. \"Let me get those pies. Last time I saw Kat she was thin as a rail, that poor girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray soon had a paper grocery bag stacked with boxed pies. He headed through the house to the front porch. He pushed outside and crossed to the stack of boxes. They contained everything from Monk\u0027s locker and a few things kept at Gray\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray also had a box to take to the funeral home. Ryder Blunt, the billionaire, had returned Monk\u0027s prosthetic hand, having to cut through the wing strut of his seaplane to free it. Kat had refused to even look at it. And Gray didn\u0027t blame her. But she did ask that the hand be added to the empty casket that would be lowered into Arlington National Cemetery. They were each supposed to also bring tokens of remembrances to include in the casket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had found a copy of Monk\u0027s favorite movie. The man had left it at Gray\u0027s apartment after a pizza-and-popcorn night. Sound of Music. Monk knew all the words, singing along as he bounced Penelope on his knee. Monk had the biggest heart of any man he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would\u0027ve made a great father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray crossed to the porch swing. He pulled out his letter of resignation folded into threes, crumpled a bit. He straightened the crinkles between his thumb and forefinger. He wished he could talk to Monk about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he sat, he heard something scratching among the boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe neighborhood squirrels were fearless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, damn, the pies. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray got up and crossed to the stack. But the noise wasn\u0027t coming from the bag of pies. He frowned. He shifted around until he found the right box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray removed the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter hadn\u0027t only commissioned the repair to his father\u0027s leg and trashed T-bird. He had not wanted to send Monk\u0027s hand into the ground all charred. So he had the prosthesis meticulously restored. It rested in a foam mold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now one of the fingers was digging at the foam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lifted the hand. The index finger wiggled in the air. Gray felt a shudder pass through him. What if Kat had seen this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMust be a short in the wiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the hand down on the porch chair. The finger continued to move, tapping at the wooden seat. Gray turned away in disgust. He tugged out his cell phone, ready to blast whoever messed up at Sigma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he dialed, his ear stayed morbidly attuned to the tapping. As he listened, Gray realized it drummed out a pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Morse code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA familiar distress call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS.O.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray swung around, staring down at the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monk . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:45 P.M. Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Tunis climbed the steep ravine of the jungle-shrouded mountains, following the brilliant cascade of a waterfall. A fine mist hung in the air, scintillating in the dappled sunlight. A pileated gibbon chattered in protest at her passage, hanging from a vine by one arm, its black face framed by gray fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued onward, moving purposefully through the rainforest. The Cardamom Mountains formed the border between Cambodia and Thailand, an inhospitable land of dense forests and inaccessible hills. On her fourth day into the mountains, sleeping in a hammock under mosquito netting, she had spotted an endangered Indochinese tiger, with its stocky body and tightly drawn stripes. It slipped through the forest, uttering a low growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, she hadn\u0027t seen anything larger than the howling gibbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainly no people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the isolation and difficult terrain, the mountains had once been the last refuge of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who retreated here because of the harsh terrain. Land mines were still a great risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Susan suspected she was days past where even the guerrillas dared to tread. She reached the crest of a ridge and followed the stream across a forested plateau. Ahead, a few small shapes slipped into the water, from perches on logs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatagur baska.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsian river terrapin. One of the most endangered species on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso known as the Royal Turtle, revered as guardians of the gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere they made their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust past their mud nests and hibernating burrows, Susan came upon a collection of jars by the river, cylindrical clay pots standing three feet tali, scribed with lichen, carved with intricate designs. Ancient burial jars. They contained the bones of kings and queens. There were such sites scattered throughout the mountains, considered very sacred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one visited this particular site, the most ancient of them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan left the river and passed through the cemetery. The burial jars eventually thinned as the forest abutted against a cracked cliff face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew where she had to go, knew from the moment she had been revived by Dr. Cummings. She had gained more than just the cure for the world—but she had told no one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan reached the cliff and crossed to a lightning-bolt-shaped crack, gaping two feet wide at the base. She wiggled out of her pack and turned sideways to push into the fissure. She took tiny steps, sliding deeper and deeper. Behind her, the sunlight faded, growing thinner and thinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon she was in total darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan stretched out a hand, reaching her arm forward. A glowing fire, willed from within, ignited at her fingertips and spread down to her shoulder. She raised her arm like a lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere was another secret she had kept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not her greatest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLighting her own path, she headed deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know how far she traveled, losing the firm passage of time. But it was certainly well into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually a glow appeared, flowing back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcoming her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA match to her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued at her same pace, sensing no need to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, she entered a great vaulted space. The source of the light became clear. Spreading far into the distance, small fires shone like a scatter of stars across the bowled floor. Hundreds and hundreds. She walked out into the cavern, passing the fires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach was a figure, spread-eagled on the floor, ablaze with an inner fire, burning flesh to a crystalline translucency. She stared down into one. All that remained visible was the nervous system: brain, spinal cord, and the vast tangle of peripheral nerves. The open arms, flowing with filamentous fibers, looked like unfurled wings, feathered with tufts of fine nerve bundles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngels in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlumbering. Waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan marched onward. She reached a figure who wasn\u0027t as consumed, who still showed the beat of a heart and the flow of blood, where bones still hinted at form and function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan found an open spot at his side and lay down. She stretched her arms. Her fingertips brushed her neighbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words reached her in an old Italian dialect, but she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. Yes. I am the last. The source has been destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen rest, child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor how long? When will the world be ready?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered her. It would be a very long sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo home, my child. . . for now, go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan closed her eyes and let that which needed to sleep drop away. All else, she slipped into the bubble that composed the entirety of her life and stepped through it to what lay beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight blinded as if she stared into the full face of the sun. She lowered her gaze, blinking away the glare. The world filled back in around her. The gentle rock of the boat under her bare feet. The cry of a lone gull, the hush of waves against the hull, and the sweep of wind over her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a dream, a memory ... or something more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled the salt air. A beautiful day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed to the ship\u0027s rail and stared out at the blue expanse. Green islands dotted the distance. A few clouds drifted. She heard the tread of feet on the stairs leading up from the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she turned, he climbed into view, pulling up with his arms, dressed in shorts and an Ocean Pacific T-shirt. He spotted her, with a startled expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he smiled. \"Oh, there you are.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-84.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
