Certain parts of Hanna were out of focus, and the composition wasn’t artful at all. It looked like bad porn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna flinched, suddenly light-headed. “What are these? Where are the others? The good ones?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The others don’t matter.” Patrick’s smile grew broader and broader. “These are the gold mine. To me, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna backed away, her heart sinking. “W-what do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon, Hanna. Do I really have to spell it out for you? What would Daddy do if he saw these? If his competitor saw these? I have friends in high places. This would make a top story on TMZ. And then . . . poof!” Patrick snapped his fingers. “Bye-bye, Senate campaign!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s body felt swelteringly hot, then frigidly cold. “You wouldn’t!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t? You don’t even know me, Hanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna wilted against the island, her hopes and dreams leaking out of her like a punctured balloon. Everything he’d said, all his kind praise, had been a ruse. “Please don’t show those to anyone. I’ll do anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick placed his finger on his chin and cast his eyes to the ceiling, like he was pretending to think. “I won’t if you come up with ten thousand dollars by the end of this weekend. How about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s jaw dropped. “I don’t have that kind of money!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you do, rich girl.” Patrick’s eyes gleamed. “You just have to be creative about where to look. I want it in cash in a manila envelope. Give it to a guy named Pete who works at the flower stand at Thirtieth Street Station. If you don’t, you’ll be link of the week. Daddy’s little assistant will have to work very hard removing this from the Internet. And I doubt the public will trust a man whose teenage daughter takes off her top for strangers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stared at him. Her gaze fell to the photos again. Suddenly, the whole scenario was hideously clear to her. “Y-you’re not even a real photographer, are you? You don’t have connections in New York. You just said that to set me up! You lied!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick laughed and held up his palms. “You got me.” Then he lowered his face to Hanna’s. “I guess you’re not the only one who’s good at lying, Ms. Marin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna didn’t wait to hear another word. She backed away and ran out the door, slamming it hard. The building seemed even more derelict than it had twenty minutes ago. The couple was still arguing downstairs. The tin ceiling looked like it was about to collapse. Four floors down, Hanna thought she heard the faintest giggle yet again, like someone had heard everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it,” Hanna screamed. Whoever this bitch A was, Hanna was going to tackle him or her to the ground and tell them to shut the hell up. She raced to the bottom of the stairs, her arms pumping hard, her fingers barely grazing the dilapidated railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once she reached the lobby, it was empty. The front door swung on its hinges, the only indication that someone had just been there. A had gotten away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing like that fresh mountain air\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kahns’ Range Rover, equipped with snow chains and a heavy-duty ski rack, rolled into the circular driveway of the Whippoorwill Lodge on Lenape Mountain. Bellhops and valets in heavy padded jackets rushed to the car and began to remove their baggage from the back. Noel and his two older brothers, Eric and Christopher, jumped out and stretched their legs. Aria followed, nearly wiping out on the icy asphalt. Hello, hadn’t the bellhops ever heard of salt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, disembarking from the car like a fur-clad princess, was Klaudia. The tip of her nose was adorably pink from the cold and her butt was perfectly round in dark-denim jeggings. Every one of the bellhops turned to gape at her. “Do you need help?” they asked in unison. “Is there anything we can carry for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You so sweet!” Klaudia trilled, shooting each of them winning smiles that made Aria want to puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria turned to Noel. “Can we go inside? It’s freezing out here.” The digital temperature readout on a bank they’d passed had said two degrees Fahrenheit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel chuckled. “This is nothing—wait till you’re on top of the mountain!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t feel cold when you hiihto!” Klaudia said to Aria in an excited voice. By now, Aria knew that hiihto was Finnish for ski. Why couldn’t Klaudia just say it in English? It wasn’t like it was hard. Three letters long. Ski. Figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shot Klaudia a tight smile and turned away, feeling as rigid and sharp-edged as the icicles that dangled precariously from the roof. This was just about the last place she wanted to be right now, but she was terrified of what might happen if she let Noel out of her sight. Klaudia might get her talons in him—and how could he resist her? After all, his current girlfriend was nothing but a peikko.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria blinked and looked up. Noel was calling to her from the lodge door. The Kahn brothers and Klaudia had already gone in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed them into the large lobby. Every surface was paneled in oak, making the room look like a giant sauna. The air smelled like cinnamon and hot chocolate, and people clonked by in heavy ski boots, wooly hats, and oven mitt–sized gloves. Guests lounged on tobacco-colored leather couches and warmed themselves by a blazing fire in the corner. A yellow lab with a red kerchief tied around his neck dozed on a doggie bed next to the big window that looked out on the slopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice,” Christopher murmured, walking over to the window. Christopher was three years older than Aria and Noel and home from Columbia on a break. He had Noel’s same clean-cut, golden features, but there was something hard about him, less endearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perfect powder,” Eric murmured. He was two years older than Noel and went to Hollis—but only as a formality. His real goal in life was to become a ski bum in Montana or a surf instructor in Barbados.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mahtava!” Klaudia chirped, staring out the window, too. Whatever that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria looked at the view. The mountain seemed to go straight up at a ninety-degree pitch. Skiers expertly zigzagged down the face. When a boy fell, a cloud of snow billowed in all directions. Aria felt tired just watching them. She eyed the sleeping dog in the corner again. Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kahns checked in, and the concierge doled out five room keys, one for each of them—thank God Aria and Klaudia didn’t have to share. Once Aria was in her room—which had a king-sized bed with lots of pillows, a tiny kitchenette, and yet another view of the daunting ski mountain—she flopped on the bed and shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks like you have some competition, Aria! We both know Noel has a thing for blondes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA’s text was like a bad song stuck in her head. A must have seen Aria reading Klaudia’s iPhone. But how? Had A hidden behind a rack of snowsuits? Spied on her through the in-store security camera?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria had a sinking feeling the note was right—Noel did have a thing for blondes. He’d loved Ali—and he’d definitely noticed Tabitha. Even after they got back from Jamaica, Noel had made passing references to Tabitha, things like Hey, didn’t that blond girl remind you of someone? There was something about her I couldn’t quite put my finger on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even though he asked a lot of questions, he wasn’t suspicious. No one was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded on the door. Aria shot up, nerves jangling. “H-hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s me,” Noel called from the hallway. “Can I come in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria unlatched the door. Noel thrust a big basket of tiger lilies, coffee, and snacks in her face. “For you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you!” Aria cried. There was even a stuffed pig in the basket, reminding Aria of her favorite puppet, Pigtunia. But then she stiffened. Didn’t guys only give their girlfriends flowers when they felt guilty? “What’s the occasion?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw it in the gift shop and thought of you.” Noel set the basket on the TV bureau and wrapped his arms around her. He smelled like the tea tree oil facial cleanser Aria had bought him for Valentine’s Day. “Look, I know skiing isn’t really your thing, but I’m so happy you came. This trip wouldn’t be the same without you here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded so genuine and earnest that Aria’s suspicions thawed. Klaudia and A were turning her into a crazy person. “I’m happy I came, too,” she admitted. “This place is gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re gorgeous.” Noel pulled her down on the bed. They started kissing, first tentatively, then more and more passionately. Noel pulled Aria’s shirt over her head, and Aria reciprocated. They pressed their bare chests together, feeling each other’s warmth. “Mmm,” Noel murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey paused for a moment, and then Aria touched Noel’s waistband and undid his belt buckle. Noel breathed in, obviously surprised. Next, Aria undid the button on his jeans and pulled them off him. She stared at his muscled legs, grinning. He was wearing the golden retriever–printed boxers she’d picked out for him at J. Crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, she reached for the button on her own jeans. Noel grabbed her hand, his eyes wide. “Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria gazed around the small room, from the flat-screen TV to the champagne bucket in the corner to the generic-looking chair and ottoman by the large windows. Now that they were in an unfamiliar setting, she felt less inhibited than normal. Or maybe she just felt compelled to prove to Noel exactly what he meant to her. It might just be the only way to ensure he would remain hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel pulled off Aria’s jeans the rest of the way. They clung to each other for a while, almost totally unclothed, their lips locked in an embrace. Aria’s heart pounded. She was really going to do this. It was time. As Noel rolled on top of her, she kissed him hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnock knock knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both froze, staring at each other with wide eyes. There was silence, and then another knock. “Hello?” Klaudia chirped. “Aria? Noel? You there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria winced. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noel?” Klaudia’s voice was muffled. “Come on! Time for hiihto!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe if we be quiet she’ll go away,” Noel whispered, tracing his finger along Aria’s bare collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the knocking persisted. “Noel!” Klaudia teased. “I know you in there! We must hiihto!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Noel groaned, grabbed his jeans from the floor, and slid them back on. “Okay,” he called back. “We’re coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, goody!” Klaudia said from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stared at Noel, slack-jawed. “What?” Noel asked, pausing with one pant leg halfway past his knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Aria was so angry she couldn’t speak. “We were sort of in the middle of something. Are you seriously going to drop everything for her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel’s face softened. “We’ll have plenty of time alone tonight, when no one will disturb us. And Klaudia’s right—the lifts close in a couple hours. We’ve got to get our hiihto on. Aren’t you ready for your first ski lesson with her?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-pretty-little-liars-9/page-22.html","bookId":2677,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:59 AM"}
