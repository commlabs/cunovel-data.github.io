Brutha hurried out into the courtyard and into Vorbis\u0027s cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Brutha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis was sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are a young man visiting a new place,” said Vorbis. “No doubt there is much you wish to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is?” said Brutha. Vorbis was using the exquisitor voice again-a level monotone, a voice like a strip of dull steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may go where you wish. See new things, Brutha. Learn everything you can. You are my eyes and ears. And my memory. Learn about this place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er. Really, lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have I impressed you with my use of careless language, Brutha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, lord.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go away. Fill yourself. And be back by sunset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er. Even the Library?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah? Yes, the Library. The Library that they have here. Of course. Crammed with useless and dangerous and evil knowledge. I can see it in my mind, Brutha. Can you imagine that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Lord Vorbis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your innocence is your shield, Brutha. No. By all means go to the Library. I have no fear of any effect on you. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Vorbis?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Tyrant said that they hardly did anything to Brother Murduck . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence unrolled its restless length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis said, “He lied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Brutha waited. Vorbis continued to stare at the wall. Brutha wondered what he saw there. When nothing else appeared to be forthcoming, he said, “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back a bit before he went out, so that he could squint under the deacon\u0027s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s probably in trouble, Brutha thought as he hurried through the palace. Everyone wants to eat tortoises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to look everywhere while avoiding the friezes of unclad nymphs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha was technically aware that women were a different shape from men; he hadn\u0027t left the village until he was twelve, by which time some of his contemporaries were already married. And Omnianism encouraged early marriage as a preventive against Sin, although any activity involving any part of the human anatomy between neck and knees was more or less Sinful in any case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha wished he was a better scholar so he could ask his God why this was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he found himself wishing his God was a more intelligent God so it could answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hasn\u0027t screamed for me, he thought. I\u0027m sure I would have heard. So maybe no one\u0027s cooking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slave polishing one of the statues directed him to the Library. Brutha pounded down an aisle of pillars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the courtyard in front of the Library it was crowded with philosophers, all craning to look at something. Brutha could hear the usual petulant squabbling that showed that philosophical discourse was under way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve got ten obols here says it can\u0027t do it again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talking money? That\u0027s something you don\u0027t hear every day, Xeno.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. And it\u0027s about to say goodbye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, don\u0027t be stupid. It\u0027s a tortoise. It\u0027s just doing a mating dance . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a breathless pause. Then a sort of collective sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s never a right angle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on! I\u0027d like to see you do better in the circumstances!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s it doing now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hypotenuse, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call that a hypotenuse? It\u0027s wiggly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s not wiggly. It\u0027s drawing it straight and you\u0027re looking at it in a wiggly way!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll bet thirty obols it can\u0027t do a square!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here\u0027s forty obols says it can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another pause, and then a cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s more of a parallelogram, if you ask me,” said a petulant voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, I knows a square when I sees one! And that\u0027s a square.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. Double or nothing then. Bet it can\u0027t do a dodecagon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah! You bet it couldn\u0027t do a septagon just now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Double or nothing. Dodecagon. Worried, eh! Feeling a bit avis domestica? Cluck-cluck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s a shame to take your money . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten sides? Ten sides? Hah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Told you it wasn\u0027t any good! Whoever heard of a tortoise doing geometry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another daft idea, Didactylos?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said so all along. It\u0027s just a tortoise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s good eating on one of those things . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mass of philosophers broke up, pushing past Brutha without paying him much attention. He caught a glimpse of a circle of damp sand, covered with geometrical figures. Om was sitting in the middle of them. Behind him was a very grubby pair of philosophers, counting out a pile of coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did we do, Urn?” said Didactylos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re fifty-two obols up, master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See? Every day things improve. Pity it didn\u0027t know the difference between ten and twelve, though. Cut one of its legs off and we\u0027ll have a stew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cut off a leg?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, a tortoise like that, you don\u0027t eat it all at once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos turned his face towards a plump young man with splayed feet and a red face, who was staring at the tortoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The tortoise does know the difference between ten and twelve,” said the fat boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn thing just lost me eighty obols,” said Didactylos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. But tomorrow . . .” the boy began, his eyes glazing as if he was carefully repeating something he\u0027d just heard “. . . tomorrow . . . you should be able to get odds of at least three to one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos\u0027s mouth dropped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me the tortoise, Urn,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apprentice philosopher reached down and picked up Om, very carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, I thought right at the start there was something funny about this creature,” said Didactylos. “I said to Urn, there\u0027s tomorrow\u0027s dinner, and then he says no, it\u0027s dragging its tail in the sand and doing geometry. That doesn\u0027t come natural to a tortoise, geometry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm\u0027s eye turned to Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had to,” he said. “It was the only way to get his attention. Now I\u0027ve got him by the curiosity. When you\u0027ve got \u0027em by the curiosity, their hearts and minds will follow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s a God,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? What\u0027s his name?” said the philosopher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t tell him! Don\u0027t tell him! The local gods\u0027ll hear!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos turned Om over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Turtle Moves,” said Urn thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master did a book,” said Urn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really a book,” said Didactylos modestly. “More a scroll. Just a little thing I knocked off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saying that the world is flat and goes through space on the back of a giant turtle?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you read it?” Didactylos\u0027s gaze was unmoving. “Are you a slave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” said Brutha. \"I am a-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t mention my name! Call yourself a scribe or something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-scribe,” said Brutha weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” said Urn. “I can see that. The telltale callus on the thumb where you hold the pen. The inkstains all over your sleeves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha glanced at his left thumb. \"I haven\u0027t-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” said Urn, grinning. “Use your left hand, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er, I use both,” said Brutha. “But not very well, everyone says.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” said Didactylos. “Ambi-sinister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He means incompetent with both hands,” said Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Yes. That\u0027s me.” Brutha coughed politely. “Look . . . I\u0027m looking for a philosopher. Um. One that knows about gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, “You aren\u0027t going to say they\u0027re a relic of an outmoded belief system?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos, still running his fingers over Om\u0027s shell, shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. I like my thunderstorms a long way off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Could you stop turning him over and over? He\u0027s just told me he doesn\u0027t like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can tell how old they are by cutting them in half and counting the rings,” said Didactylos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um. He hasn\u0027t got much of a sense of humor, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re Omnian, by the sound of it.” Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here to talk about the treaty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do the listening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what do you want to know about gods?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha appeared to be listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually he said: “How they start. How they grow. And what happens to them afterwards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos put the tortoise into Brutha\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Costs money, that kind of thinking,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me know when we\u0027ve used more than fifty-two obols\u0027 worth,” said Brutha. Didactylos grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like you can think for yourself,” he said. “Got a good memory?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not exactly a good one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right? Right. Come on into the Library. It\u0027s got an earthed copper roof, you know. Gods really hate that sort of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos reached down beside him and picked up a rusty iron lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha looked up at the big white building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s the Library?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Didactylos. “That\u0027s why it\u0027s got LIBRVM carved over the door in such big letters. But a scribe like you\u0027d know that, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Library of Ephebe was-before it burned down-the second biggest on the Disc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot as big as the library in Unseen University, of course, but that library had one or two advantages on account of its magical nature. No other library anywhere, for example, has a whole gallery of unwritten books-books that would have been written if the author hadn\u0027t been eaten by an alligator around chapter 1, and so on. Atlases of imaginary places. Dictionaries of illusory words. Spotters\u0027 guides to invisible things. Wild thesauri in the Lost Reading Room. A library so big that it distorts reality and has opened gateways to all other libraries, everywhere and everywhen . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so unlike the Library at Ephebe, with its four or five hundred volumes. Many of them were scrolls, to save their readers the fatigue of having to call a slave every time they wanted a page turned. Each one lay in its own pigeonhole, though. Books shouldn\u0027t be kept too close together, otherwise they interact in strange and unforeseeable ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunbeams lanced through the shadows, as palpable as pillars in the dusty air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was the least of the wonders in the Library, Brutha couldn\u0027t help noticing a strange construction in the aisles. Wooden laths had been fixed between the rows of stone shelves about two meters from the floor, so that they supported a wider plank of no apparent use whatsoever. Its underside had been decorated with rough wooden shapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Library,” announced Didactylos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up. His fingers gently brushed the plank over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dawned on Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re blind aren\u0027t you?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you carry a lantern?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-23.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
