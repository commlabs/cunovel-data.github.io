I came up last Friday, sorry to leave\n\u003cbr\u003e Lock Willow, but glad to see the campus again. It is a pleasant\n\u003cbr\u003e sensation to come back to something familiar. I am beginning to feel\n\u003cbr\u003e at home in college, and in command of the situation; I am beginning,\n\u003cbr\u003e in fact, to feel at home in the world--as though I really belonged\n\u003cbr\u003e to it and had not just crept in on sufferance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say. \n\u003cbr\u003e A person important enough to be a Trustee can\u0027t appreciate the\n\u003cbr\u003e feelings of a person unimportant enough to be a foundling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now, Daddy, listen to this. Whom do you think I am rooming with? \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. It\u0027s the truth. \n\u003cbr\u003e We have a study and three little bedrooms--VOILA!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together,\n\u003cbr\u003e and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie--why, I can\u0027t imagine,\n\u003cbr\u003e for they are not a bit alike; but the Pendletons are naturally\n\u003cbr\u003e conservative and inimical (fine word!) to change. Anyway, here we are. \n\u003cbr\u003e Think of Jerusha Abbott, late of the John Grier Home for Orphans,\n\u003cbr\u003e rooming with a Pendleton. This is a democratic country.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie is running for class president, and unless all signs fail,\n\u003cbr\u003e she is going to be elected. Such an atmosphere of intrigue you should\n\u003cbr\u003e see what politicians we are! Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get\n\u003cbr\u003e our rights, you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours. \n\u003cbr\u003e Election comes next Saturday, and we\u0027re going to have a torchlight\n\u003cbr\u003e procession in the evening, no matter who wins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study. I\u0027ve never seen\n\u003cbr\u003e anything like it before. Molecules and Atoms are the material employed,\n\u003cbr\u003e but I\u0027ll be in a position to discuss them more definitely next month.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am also taking argumentation and logic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also history of the whole world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also plays of William Shakespeare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also French.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I should rather have elected economics than French, but I\n\u003cbr\u003e didn\u0027t dare, because I was afraid that unless I re-elected\n\u003cbr\u003e French, the Professor would not let me pass--as it was,\n\u003cbr\u003e I just managed to squeeze through the June examination. \n\u003cbr\u003e But I will say that my high-school preparation was not very adequate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There\u0027s one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast\n\u003cbr\u003e as she does in English. She went abroad with her parents when she\n\u003cbr\u003e was a child, and spent three years in a convent school. You can\n\u003cbr\u003e imagine how bright she is compared with the rest of us--irregular verbs\n\u003cbr\u003e are mere playthings. I wish my parents had chucked me into a French\n\u003cbr\u003e convent when I was little instead of a foundling asylum. Oh no,\n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t either! Because then maybe I should never have known you. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027d rather know you than French.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Goodbye, Daddy. I must call on Harriet Martin now,\n\u003cbr\u003e and, having discussed the chemical situation,\n\u003cbr\u003e casually drop a few thoughts on the subject of our next president.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours in politics,\n\u003cbr\u003e J. Abbott\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59748.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
