Hiro climbs down from the roof of the turret and, throwing caution to the wind, drinks three glasses of L.A. tap water. He gets some bacon out of Da5id\u0027s fridge and throws it in the microwave. Most of General Jim\u0027s people have left, and there is only a token guard of soldiers down on the road. Hiro locks all the doors that look out on the hillside, because he can\u0027t stop thinking about Raven. Then he sits at the kitchen table and goggles in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Black Sun is mostly full of Asians, including a lot of people from the Bombay film industry, glaring at each other, stroking their black mustaches, trying to figure out what kind of hyperviolent action film will play in Persepolis next year. It is nighttime there. Hiro is one of the few Americans in the joint.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlong the back wall of the bar is a row of private rooms, ranging from little tete-a-tetes to big conference rooms where a bunch of avatars can gather and have a meeting. Juanita is waiting for Hiro in one of the smaller ones. Her avatar just looks like Juanita. It is an honest representation, with no effort made to hide the early suggestions of crow\u0027s-feet at the corners of her big black eyes. Her glossy hair is so well resolved that Hiro can see individual strands refracting the light into tiny rainbows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m at Da5id\u0027s house. Where are you?\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In an airplane -- so I may break up,\" Juanita says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You on your way here?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"To Oregon, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Portland?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Astoria.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why on earth would you go to Astoria, Oregon, at a time like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJuanita takes a deep breath, lets it out shakily. \"If I told you, we\u0027d get into an argument.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the latest word on Da5id?\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The same.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Any diagnosis?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJuanita sighs, looks tired. \"There won\u0027t be any diagnosis,\" she says. \"It\u0027s a software, not a hardware, problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re rounding up the usual suspects. CAT scans, NMR scans, PET scans, EEGs. Everything\u0027s fine. There\u0027s nothing wrong with his brain -- his hardware.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It just happens to be running the wrong program?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"His software got poisoned. Da5id had a snow crash last night, inside his head.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to say it\u0027s a psychological problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It kind of goes beyond those established categories,\" Juanita says, \"because it\u0027s a new phenomenon. A very old one, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this thing just happen spontaneously, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me,\" she says. \"You were there last night. Did anything happen after I left?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a Snow Crash hypercard that he got from Raven outside The Black Sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit. That bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s the bastard? Raven or Da5id?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Da5id. I tried to warn him.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He used it.\" Hiro goes on to explain the Brandy with the magic scroll. \"Then later he had computer trouble and got bounced.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard about that part,\" she says. \"That\u0027s why I called the paramedics.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see the connection between Da5id\u0027s computer having a crash, and you calling an ambulance.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The Brandy\u0027s scroll wasn\u0027t just showing random static. It was flashing up a large amount of digital information, in binary form. That digital information was going straight into Da5id\u0027s optic nerve. Which is part of the brain, incidentally -- if you stare into a person\u0027s pupil, you can see the terminal of the brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Da5id\u0027s not a computer. He can\u0027t read binary code.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a hacker. He messes with binary code for a living. That ability is firm-wired into the deep structures of his brain. So he\u0027s susceptible to that form of information. And so are you, home boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of information are we talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad news. A metavirus,\" Juanita says. \"It\u0027s the atomic bomb of informational warfare -- a virus that causes any system to infect itself with new viruses.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s what made Da5id sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t I get sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Too far away. Your eyes couldn\u0027t resolve the bitmap. It has to be right up in your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about that one,\" Hiro says. \"But I have another question. Raven also distributes another drug -- in Reality -- called, among other things, Snow Crash. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a drug,\" Juanita says. \"They make it look like a drug and feel like a drug so that people will want to take it. It\u0027s laced with cocaine and some other stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s not a drug, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s chemically processed blood serum taken from people who are infected with the metavirus,\" Juanita says. \"That is, it\u0027s just another way of spreading the infection.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s spreading it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"L. Bob Rife\u0027s private church. All of those people are infected.\" Hiro puts his head in his hands. He\u0027s not exactly thinking about this; he\u0027s letting it ricochet around in his skull, waiting for it to come to rest. \"Wait a minute, Juanita. Make up your mind. This Snow Crash thing -- is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJuanita shrugs. \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat Juanita is talking this way does not make it any easier for Hiro to get back on his feet in this conversation. \"How can you say that? You\u0027re a religious person yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lump all religion together.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All people have religions. It\u0027s like we have religion receptors built into our brain cells, or something, and we\u0027ll latch onto anything that\u0027ll fill that niche for us. Now, religion used to be essentially viral -- a piece of information that replicated inside the human mind, jumping from one person to the next. That\u0027s the way it used to be, and unfortunately, that\u0027s the way it\u0027s headed right now. But there have been several efforts to deliver us from the hands of primitive, irrational religion. The first was made by someone named Enki about four thousand years ago. The second was made by Hebrew scholars in the eighth century B.C., driven out of their homeland by the invasion of Sargon II, but eventually it just devolved into empty legalism. Another attempt was made by Jesus -- that one was hijacked by viral influences within fifty days of his death. The virus was suppressed by the Catholic Church, but we\u0027re in the middle of a big epidemic that started in Kansas in 1900 and has been gathering momentum ever since.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe in God or not?\" Hiro says. First things first.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe in Jesus?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But not in the physical, bodily resurrection of Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be a Christian without believing in that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I would say,\" Juanita says, \"how can you be a Christian with it? Anyone who takes the trouble to study the gospels can see that the bodily resurrection is a myth that was tacked onto the real story several years after the real histories were written. It\u0027s so National Enquirer-esque, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBeyond that, Juanita doesn\u0027t have much to say. She doesn\u0027t want to get into it now, she says. She doesn\u0027t want to prejudice Hiro\u0027s thinking \"at this point.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that imply that there\u0027s going to be some other point? Is this a continuing relationship?\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to find the people who infected Da5id?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Hell, Juanita, even if it weren\u0027t for the fact that he is my friend, I\u0027d want to find them before they infect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at the Babel stack, Hiro, and then visit me if I get back from Astoria.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If you get back? What are you doing there?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Research.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s been putting on a businesslike front through this whole talk, spitting out information, telling Hiro the way it is. But she\u0027s tired and anxious, and Hiro gets the idea that she\u0027s deeply afraid.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" he says. He was all ready to do some flirting with her during this meeting, picking up where they left off last night. But something has changed in Juanita\u0027s mind between then and now. Flirting is the last thing on her mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJuanita\u0027s going to do something dangerous in Oregon. She doesn\u0027t want Hiro to know about it so that he won\u0027t worry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some good stuff in the Babel stack about someone named Inanna,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Inanna?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A Sumerian goddess. I\u0027m sort of in love with her. Anyway, you can\u0027t understand what I\u0027m about to do until you understand Inanna.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good luck,\" Hiro says. \"Say hi to Inanna for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"When you get back, I want to spend some time with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The feeling is mutual,\" she says. \"But we have to get out of this first.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I didn\u0027t realize I was in something.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be a sap. We\u0027re all in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro leaves, exiting into The Black Sun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is one guy wandering around the Hacker Quadrant who really stands out. His avatar doesn\u0027t look so hot. And he\u0027s having trouble controlling it. He looks like a guy who\u0027s just goggled into the Metaverse for the first time and doesn\u0027t know how to move around. He keeps bumping into tables, and when he wants to turn around, he spins around several times, not knowing how to stop himself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro walks toward him, because his face seems a little familiar. When the guy finally stops moving long enough for Hiro to resolve him clearly, he recognizes the avatar. It\u0027s a Clint. Most often seen in the company of a Brandy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Clint recognizes Hiro, and his surprised face comes on for a second, is then replaced by his usual stern, stiff-lipped, craggy appearance. He holds up his hands together in front of him, and Hiro sees that he is holding a scroll, just like Brandy\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro reaches for his katana, but the scroll is already up in his face, spreading open to reveal the blue glare of the bitmap inside. He sidesteps, gets over to one side of the Clint, raising the katana overhead, snaps the katana straight down and cuts the Clint\u0027s arms off.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs the scroll falls, it spreads open even wider. Hiro doesn\u0027t dare look at it now. The Clint has turned around and is awkwardly trying to escape from The Black Sun, bouncing from table to table like a pinball.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf Hiro could kill the guy -- cut his head off -- then his avatar would stay in The Black Sun, be carried away by the Graveyard Daemons. Hiro could do some hacking and maybe figure out who he is, where he\u0027s coming in from.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut a few dozen hackers are lounging around the bar, watching all of this, and if they come over and look at the scroll, they\u0027ll all end up like Da5id.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro squats down, looking away from the scroll, and pulls up one of the hidden trapdoors that lead down into the tunnel system. He\u0027s the one who coded those tunnels into The Black Sun to begin with; he\u0027s the only person in the whole bar who can use them. He sweeps the scroll into the tunnel with one hand, then closes the door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro can see the Clint, way over near the exit, trying to get his avatar aimed out through the door. Hiro runs after him. If the guy reaches the Street, he\u0027s gone -- he\u0027ll turn into a translucent ghost. With a fifty-foot head start in a crowd of a million other translucent ghosts, there\u0027s just no way. As usual, there\u0027s a crowd of wannabes gathered on the Street out front. Hiro can see the usual assortment, including a few black-and-white people.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne of those black-and-whites is Y.T. She\u0027s loitering out there waiting for Hiro to come out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Y.T!\" he shouts. \"Chase that guy with no arms!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro gets out the door just a few seconds after the Clint does. Both the Clint and Y.T. are already gone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe turns back into The Black Sun, pulls up a trapdoor, and drops down into the tunnel system, the realm of the Graveyard Daemons. One of them has already picked up the scroll and is trudging in toward the center to throw it on the fire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, bud,\" Hiro says, \"take a right turn at the next tunnel and leave that thing in my office, okay? But do me a favor and roll it up first.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe follows the Graveyard Daemon down the tunnel, under the Street, until they\u0027re under the neighborhood where Hiro and the other hackers have their houses. Hiro has the Graveyard Daemon deposit the rolled-up scroll in his workshop, down in the basement -- the room where Hiro does his hacking. Then Hiro continues upstairs to his office.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/714.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
