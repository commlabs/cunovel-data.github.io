{"id":68293,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eNew York City\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1976\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporters gathered outside the gray fa\u0026amp;ccedil;ade of New York\u0027s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel watched the parade of celebrities in evening dress alight from their limousines, enter the revolving doors, and head for the Grand Ballroom on the third floor. The guests had come from around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCameras flashed as reporters called out, \"Mr. Vice-President, would you look this way, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Governor Adams, could I have one more picture, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were senators and representatives from several foreign countries, business tycoons, and celebrities. And they were all there to celebrate Ellen Scott\u0027s sixtieth birthday. In truth, it was not so much Ellen Scott that they were honoring as the philanthropy of Scott Industries, one of the most powerful conglomerates in the world. The huge, sprawling empire included oil companies and steel mills, communications systems and banks. All the money raised this evening would go to international charities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Industries had interests in every part of the world. Twenty-seven years earlier, its president, Milo Scott, had died unexpectedly of a heart attack, and his wife, Ellen, had taken over the management of the huge conglomerate. In the ensuing years she proved to be a brilliant executive, more than tripling the assets of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria was an enormous room decorated in beige and gold, with a red-carpeted stage at one end. A balcony holding thirty-three boxes with a chandelier over each one curved around the entire room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the balcony sat the guest of honor. There were at least six hundred men and women present, dining at tables gleaming with silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen dinner was finished, the governor of New York strode onto the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, we are all here tonight for one purpose: to pay tribute to a remarkable woman and to her unselfish generosity over the years. Ellen Scott is the kind of person who could have made a success in any field. She would have been a great scientist or doctor. She would also have made a great politician, and I must tell you that if Ellen Scott decides to run for president of the United States, I\u0027ll be the first one to vote for her. Not in the next election, of course, but the one after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was laughter and applause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Ellen Scott is much more than just a brilliant woman. She is a charitable, compassionate human being who never hesitates to get involved in the problems that face the world today...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speech went on for ten more minutes, but Ellen Scott was no longer listening. How wrong he is, she thought wryly. How wrong they all are. Scott Industries isn\u0027t even my company. Milo and I stole it And I\u0027m guilty of a far greater crime than that It doesn\u0027t matter any longer. Not now. Because I\u0027ll be dead soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered the doctor\u0027s exact words as he read the lab report that was her death sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m dreadfully sorry, Mrs. Scott, but I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s no way to break this to you gently. The cancer has spread throughout your lymphatic system. It\u0027s inoperable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had felt the sudden leaden weight in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How...how long do I have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"A year - maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough time. Not with so much still to do. \"You will say nothing of this, of course.\" Her voice was steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no recollection of leaving Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center or of the drive downtown. Her only thought was: I must find her before I die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the governor\u0027s speech was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor and privilege to introduce Mrs. Ellen Scott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose to a standing ovation, then walked toward the stage, a thin, gray-haired, straight-backed woman, smartly dressed and projecting a vitality she no longer felt. Looking at me is like seeing the distant light of a long-dead star, she thought bitterly. I\u0027m not really here anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the stage she waited for the applause to die down. They\u0027re applauding a monster. What would they do if they knew? When she spoke, her voice was firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Vice-President, senators, Governor Adams...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year, she was thinking. I wonder where she is and if she is still alive. I must find out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe talked on, automatically saying all the things her audience expected to hear. \"I gladly accept this tribute not for myself, but for all those who have worked so hard to lighten the burden of those who are less fortunate than we are...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was drifting back forty-two years to Gary, Indiana...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt eighteen, Ellen Dudash was employed at the Scott Industries automotive-parts plant in Gary, Indiana. She was an attractive, outgoing girl, popular with her fellow workers. On the day Milo Scott came to inspect the plant, Ellen was selected to escort him around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! How about you, Ellie? Maybe you\u0027ll marry the boss\u0027s brother and we\u0027ll all be working for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen Dudash laughed. \"Right. And that\u0027s when pigs will grow wings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Scott was not at all what Ellen had expected. He was in his early thirties, tall and slim. Not bad-looking, Ellen thought. He was shy and almost deferential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very kind of you to take the time to show me around, Miss Dudash. I hope I\u0027m not taking you away from your work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"I hope you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so easy to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe I\u0027m kidding around with the big boss\u0027s brother. Wait till I tell Mom and Pop about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo seemed genuinely interested in the workers and their problems. Ellen took him through the department where the round drive gears and the long driven gears were made. She showed him through the annealing room, where the soft gears were put through a hardening process, and the packing section and the shipping department, and he seemed properly impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s certainly a large operation, isn\u0027t it, Miss Dudash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe owns all of this, and he acts like an awed kid I guess it takes all kinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the assembly section that the accident happened. An overhead cable car carrying metal bars to the machine shop snapped and a load of iron came tumbling down. Milo Scott was directly beneath it. Ellen saw it coming a fraction of a second before it hit and, without thinking, shoved him out of harm\u0027s way. Two of the heavy iron bars hit her before she could escape, and she was knocked unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe awakened in a private suite in a hospital. The room was literally filled with flowers. When Ellen opened her eyes and looked around, she thought: I\u0027ve died and gone to heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were orchids and roses and lilies and chrysanthemums and rare blooms she could not even begin to identify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer right arm was in a cast and her ribs were taped and felt bruised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse came in. \"Ah, you\u0027re awake, Miss Dudash. I\u0027ll inform the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where - where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blake Center - it\u0027s a private hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen looked around the large suite. I can never afford to pay for all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been screening your calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What calls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The press has been trying to get in to interview you. Your friends have been calling. Mr. Scott has telephoned several times...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Scott! \"Is he all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he hurt in the accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He was here again early this morning, but you were asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He came to see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She looked around the room. \"Most of these flowers are from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbelievable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother and father are in the waiting room. Do you feel up to seeing them now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send them in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy, I\u0027ve never been treated like this in a hospital before, Ellen thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother and father walked in and came up to the bed. They had been born in Poland and their English was tentative. Ellen\u0027s father was a mechanic, a burly, rough-hewn man in his fifties, and her mother was a bluff northern European peasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you some soup, Ellen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom - they feed people in hospitals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not my soup they don\u0027t feed you in the hospital. Eat it and you\u0027ll get well faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father said, \"Did you see the paper? I brung you a copy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed the newspaper to her. The headline read: FACTORY WORKER RISKS LIFE TO SAVE BOSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read the story twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a brave thing you done to save him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrave? It was stupid. If I had had time to think, I would have saved myself. That was the dumbest thing I ever did Why, I could have been killed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Scott came to see Ellen later that morning. He was carrying another bouquet of flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are for you,\" he said awkwardly. \"The doctor tells me you\u0027re going to be fine. I - I can\u0027t tell you how grateful I am to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the most courageous act I\u0027ve ever seen. You saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to move, but it sent a sharp pain through her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Her side was beginning to throb. \"What did the doc say was wrong with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a broken arm and three broken ribs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t have given her worse news. Her eyes filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she tell him? He would only laugh at her. She had been saving up for a long-awaited vacation to New York with some of the girls from the factory. It had been her dream. Now I\u0027ll be out of work for a month or more. There goes Manhattan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen had been working since she was fifteen. She had always been fiercely independent and self-sufficient, but now she thought: Maybe if he\u0027s so grateful he\u0027ll pay part of my hospital bills. But I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027ll ask him. She was beginning to feel drowsy. It must be the medication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said sleepily, \"Thank you for all the flowers, Mr. Scott. And it was nice meeting you.\" I\u0027ll worry about the hospital bills later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen Dudash slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, a tall, distinguished-looking man came into Ellen\u0027s suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Miss Dudash. How are you feeling this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Sam Norton, chief public-relations officer for Scott Industries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She had never seen him before. \"Do you live here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I flew in from Washington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To assist you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To assist me in what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The press is outside, Miss Dudash. Since I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ve ever held a press conference, I thought perhaps you could use some help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mainly, they\u0027re going to ask you to tell them about how and why you saved Mr. Scott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. That\u0027s easy. If I had stopped to think, I\u0027d have run like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorton stared at her. \"Miss Dudash - I don\u0027t think I would say that if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not at all what he had expected. The girl seemed to have no idea of her situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something worrying Ellen, and she decided to get it out in the open. \"Are you going to see Mr. Scott?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you do me a favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can, certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the accident\u0027s not his fault, and he didn\u0027t ask me to push him out of the way, but - \" The strong independent streak in her made her hesitate. \"Oh, never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, here it comes, Norton thought. How much reward was she going to try to extort? Would it be cash? A better job? What? \"Please, go on, Miss Dudash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blurted it out. \"The truth is, I don\u0027t have a lot of money, and I\u0027m going to lose some pay because of this, and I don\u0027t think I can afford all these hospital bills. I don\u0027t want to bother Mr. Scott, but if he could arrange a loan for me, I\u0027d pay it back.\" She saw the expression on Norton\u0027s face, and misread it. \"I\u0027m sorry. I guess I sound mercenary. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve been saving up for a trip, and - well, this screws everything up.\" She took a deep breath. \"It\u0027s not his problem. I\u0027ll manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Norton almost kissed her. How long has it been since I\u0027ve come across real innocence? It\u0027s enough to restore my faith in womankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down at the side of her bed, and his professional manner disappeared. He took her hand. \"Ellen, I have a feeling you and I are going to be great friends. I promise you, you\u0027re not going to have to worry about money. But the first thing we have to do is get you through this press conference. We want you to come out of this looking good, so that - \" He stopped himself. \"I\u0027m going to be honest. My job is to see that Scott Industries comes out of this looking good. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so. You mean it wouldn\u0027t sound so good if I said I wasn\u0027t really interested in saving Milo Scott? It would sound better if I said something like, \u0027I like working for Scott Industries so much that when I saw Milo Scott was in danger, I knew I had to try to save him, even at the risk of my own life\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Okay. If it\u0027ll help you. But I don\u0027t want to kid you, Mr. Norton. I don\u0027t know what made me do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"That will be our secret. I\u0027ll let the lions in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more than two dozen reporters and photographers from radio stations, newspapers, and magazines. It was a man-bites-dog story, and the press intended to make the most of it. It was not every day that a pretty young employee risked her life to save her boss\u0027s brother. And the fact that he happened to be Milo Scott did not hurt the story one bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Dudash - when you saw all that iron hurtling down at you, what was your first thought?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen looked over at Sam Norton with a straight face and said, \"I thought, \u0027I must save Mr. Scott. I\u0027d never forgive myself if I let him be killed.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe press conference proceeded smoothly, and when Sam Norton saw that Ellen was beginning to tire, he said, \"That\u0027s it, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I do all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were great. Now get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept fitfully. She had a dream that she was in the lobby of the Empire State Building, but the guards would not let her go up to the top because she did not have enough money to buy a ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Scott came to visit Ellen that afternoon. She was surprised to see him. She had heard that his home was in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard the press conference went very well. You\u0027re quite a heroine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Scott - I have to tell you something. I\u0027m not a heroine. I didn\u0027t stop to think about saving you. I - I just did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Sam Norton told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ellen, there are all kinds of heroism. You didn\u0027t think about saving me, but you did it instinctively, instead of saving yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I just wanted you to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam also told me that you\u0027re worried about the hospital bills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all taken care of. And as for your losing some wages\" - he smiled - \"Miss Dudash, I - I don\u0027t think you know how much I owe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t owe me anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor told me that you\u0027ll be leaving the hospital tomorrow. Will you let me buy you dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t understand, Ellen thought. I don\u0027t want his charity. Or his pity. \"I meant it when I said you don\u0027t owe me anything. Thanks for taking care of the hospital bills. We\u0027re even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now may I buy you dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how it began. Milo Scott stayed in Gary for a week, and he saw Ellen every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen\u0027s mother and father warned, \"Be careful. Big bosses don\u0027t go out with factory girls unless they want something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been Ellen\u0027s attitude at the beginning, but Milo changed her mind. He was a perfect gentleman at all times, and the truth finally dawned on Ellen: He really enjoys being with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Milo was shy and reserved, Ellen was forthright and open. All his life, Milo had been surrounded by women whose burning ambition was to become a part of the powerful Scott dynasty. They had played their calculating games. Ellen Dudash was the first totally honest woman Milo had ever met. She said exactly what was on her mind. She was bright, she was attractive, and, most of all, she was fun to be with. By the end of the week, they were both falling in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to marry you,\" Milo said. \"I can\u0027t think about anything else. Will you marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor had Ellen been able to think about anything else. The truth was that she was terrified. The Scotts were as close as America could come to royalty. They were famous, rich, and powerful. I don\u0027t belong in their circle. I would only make a fool of myself. And of Milo. But she knew she was fighting a losing battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were married by a justice of the peace in Greenwich, Connecticut, and then took a trip to Manhattan so that Ellen Dudash could meet her in-laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron Scott greeted his brother with, \"What the fuck have you done - marry a Polish hooker? Are you out of your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Scott was just as ungiving. \"Of course she married Milo for his money. When she finds out he doesn\u0027t have any, we\u0027ll arrange an annulment. This marriage will never last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey badly underestimated Ellen Dudash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother and sister-in-law hate me, but I didn\u0027t marry them. I married you. I don\u0027t want to come between you and Byron. If this is making you too unhappy, Milo, say so, and I\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his bride in his arms and whispered, \"I adore you, and when Byron and Susan really get to know you, they\u0027ll adore you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held him closely and thought: How naive he is. And how I love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron and Susan were not unpleasant to their new sister-in-law. They were patronizing. To them, she would always be the little Polish girl who worked in one of the Scott factories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen studied, and read, and learned. She watched how the wives of Milo\u0027s friends dressed, and copied them. She was determined to become a fit wife to Milo Scott, and in time she succeeded. But not in the eyes of her in-laws. And slowly her naivete turned to cynicism. The rich and powerful aren\u0027t all that wonderful, she thought. All they want is to be richer and more powerful\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen was fiercely protective of Milo, but there was little she could do to help him. Scott Industries was one of the few privately held conglomerates in the world, and all the stock belonged to Byron. Byron\u0027s younger brother was a salaried employee, and he never let Milo forget it. He treated his brother shabbily. Milo was given all the dirty jobs to do, and was never given any credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you put up with it, Milo? You don\u0027t need him. We could move away from here. You could start your own business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t leave Scott Industries. Byron needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in time, Ellen came to understand the real reason. Milo was weak. He needed someone strong to lean on. She knew then that he would never have the courage to leave the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, she thought fiercely. One day the company will be his. Byron can\u0027t live forever. Milo is his only heir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Susan Scott announced that she was pregnant, it was a blow to Ellen. The baby\u0027s going to inherit everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the baby was born, Byron said, \"It\u0027s a girl, but I\u0027ll teach her how to run the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bastard, Ellen thought. Her heart ached for Milo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Milo said was, \"Isn\u0027t she a beautiful baby?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-16.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
