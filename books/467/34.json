{"id":40969,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Rose Makes an Enemy. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leaving Ben and his new guardian on their passage across the Atlantic, we will precede them to New York, and inquire after the welfare of some of our other characters.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Beauforts seemed to have entered on a new and prosperous career. Rose continued to give lessons in music, and to receive liberal compensation. She was really an accomplished musician, and had the happy knack of making herself agreeable to her young pupils. Besides, she was backed by the influence of Miss Wilmot, and that helped her not a little. Her sister Adeline, too, gave lessons in art, and thus contributed to the family purse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My readers will not have forgotten the young man who rescued Rose from the disagreeable attentions of her elderly lover, Mr. Parkinson. More than once Rose had thought [280] of Clinton Randall, and, though she scarcely admitted it to herself, cherished the hope that they would some day meet again. The young man\u0027s frank, chivalrous manners, and handsome face and figure, had impressed her most favorably, and she suffered herself to think of him more than she would have liked to admit. Had she known that Clinton Randall had been equally attracted by her, and had made strenuous efforts to find her ever since their first meeting, she would have been much gratified.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Some weeks passed, however, before she saw him again. One afternoon, as she was walking through Madison Square on her way home from Mrs. Tilton\u0027s, where she had given her customary lessons, she met the young man in the walk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His face glowed with unmistakable joy as he hurried forward, with hand extended.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am very glad to meet you again, Miss Beaufort,\" he said, eagerly. \"Where have you been? Not out of the city?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no!\" answered Rose, successfully concealing her own pleasure at the meeting. [281] \"You can\u0027t expect a poor music-teacher to break away from her work at this season?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I did not know you were a music-teacher.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I suppose not,\" answered Rose, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you give lessons on the piano?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, it is my only instrument.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have for a long time thought of taking lessons on the piano,\" said Randall, who had never thought of it before, \"if I could only find a teacher who would not be too strict. Do you—take gentlemen?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid I could not venture upon a pupil of your age, Mr. Randall,\" said Rose, amused. \"Suppose you proved refractory?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I never would.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid my time is fully occupied. I will promise, however, to take you, if I agree to take any gentlemen.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you. I shall not forget your promise.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Clinton Randall, though he had been walking in a different direction, turned and accompanied Rose, both chatting easily and [282] familiarly. It never occurred to Rose that she might meet any one who would comment upon her and her escort. But at the corner of Eighteenth street and Broadway she met a tall young lady, who made her the slightest possible nod, while she fixed eyes of scorn and displeasure upon the two. Clinton Randall raised his hat, and they parted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know Miss Jayne, then, Miss Beaufort,\" said Randall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, slightly, and you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have met her in society.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She is a niece of Mrs. Tilton, to whose daughters I am giving music-lessons.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed! I know Mrs. Tilton—I am to attend her party next week. Shall you be there?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe so—not as a guest, however. She has invited me to play on the piano for the entertainment of the guests. You will probably dance to my music.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would rather dance with you to the music of another player, Miss Beaufort.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You forget, Mr. Randall, that I am a poor music-teacher.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [283]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think of it at all. It makes no difference in your claims to consideration.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The world does not agree with you, Mr. Randall.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then it ought. By the way, Miss Beaufort, has your elderly admirer renewed his proposals?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Parkinson? No, I have not met him since.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are sure you won\u0027t relent, and make him a happy man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think it at all likely,\" said Rose, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile Rose had made an enemy without being aware of it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Arethusa Jayne had long looked upon Clinton Randall with eyes of partiality, not alone on account of his good looks, but because he was wealthy, socially distinguished, and in all respects a desirable parti. In her vanity she had thought that he was not indifferent to her attractions. When, therefore, she saw him walking with her aunt\u0027s music-teacher, she was not only angry but jealous. She reluctantly admitted that Rose was pretty, [284] though she considered herself still more so. After this meeting she changed her plans, and went straight to her aunt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aunt,\" she said, \"whom do you think I met on Broadway just now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sure I can\u0027t tell, Arethusa. I suppose all the world and his wife are out this fine day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your music-teacher, Miss Beaufort, and Clinton Randall.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ejaculated Mrs. Tilton. \"How should she know him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have no idea they were ever introduced,\" said Arethusa, sneering. \"Probably she isn\u0027t particular how she makes acquaintance with gentlemen. I always thought her forward.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t say I ever did, Arethusa.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, she covers it up with you; but I ask you, Aunt Lucy, how could she otherwise get acquainted with a gentleman of Mr. Randall\u0027s position?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. Was she actually walking with him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly, and laughing and talking in a boisterous, unladylike way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [285]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of course this was untrue, but a jealous woman is not likely to consider her words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I thought you ought to know it, aunt, so I came and told you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think I ought to do anything, Arethusa?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would not allow such a girl to teach my children.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But she is an excellent teacher, and is recommended by Miss Wilmot.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Probably Miss Wilmot does not know how she conducts herself. No doubt she carefully conceals her forwardness from that lady.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I can\u0027t discharge her without giving reasons.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"True, aunt. By the way, Mr. Randall comes to your party, does he not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He has sent an acceptance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you mean to have Miss Beaufort there to play dancing-tunes?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; she comes a good deal cheaper than a professional,\" said Mrs. Tilton, who, even in her pleasures, was thrifty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is well. Then you will have an opportunity to see how the two go on together, [286] and can quietly signify to Miss Beaufort, the next day, your opinion of her conduct.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But, Arethusa,\" said Mrs. Tilton, who was not jealous, like her niece, \"I can\u0027t think there is anything out of the way. Miss Beaufort has always seemed to me a model of propriety.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, you dear, unsuspicious aunt! How easily you are deceived! Do you want to know my opinion of Miss Propriety—the opinion I formed when I first saw her?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Arethusa?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I saw at once that she was bold and sly, and I really think it is taking a great risk to permit your children to be under the instruction of such a girl.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Arethusa, I will take your advice and watch them both at the party.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is all I ask, Aunt Lucy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will get aunt to discharge her yet,\" said Miss Jayne to herself, with satisfied malice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80932.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
