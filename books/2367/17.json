But she could not possibly have known what happened. No one could. No one. \"I was meeting with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJan cut him short. \"The meeting was called off.

I\u0027m in the clear, Oliver decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager was worried about Oliver. He had learned that it was impossible to control Oliver Russell\u0027s libido, and he had finally worked out an arrangement with him. On certain nights, Peter Tager set up fictitious meetings for the president to attend, away from the White House, and arranged for the Secret Service escort to disappear for a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Peter Tager had gone to Senator Davis to complain about what was happening, the senator had said calmly, \"Well, after all, Oliver is a very hot-blooded man, Peter. Sometimes it\u0027s impossible to control passions like that. I deeply admire your morals, Peter. I know how much your family means to you, and how distasteful the president\u0027s behavior must seem to you. But let\u0027s not be too judgmental. You just keep on seeing that everything is handled as discreetly as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Nick Reese hated going into the forbidding, white-walled autopsy room.

He unfastened the button of his jacket and knocked on the door. It was opened by a boy in his late teens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul Yerby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The boy turned to someone in the room. \"Paul, someone for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Reese pushed his way into the room.

He took the dead girl\u0027s ring from his pocket and held it out. \"Have you ever seen this ring before, Paul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Yerby said quickly. \"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has your initials on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has?

Detective Reese reached out and took a grip on Paul\u0027s arm. \"Let\u0027s go quietly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roommate said, \"Do you want me to call your mother or anybody, Paul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Yerby shook his head, miserable. \"No. Don\u0027t call anyone.\" His voice was a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Henry I. Daly Building at 300 Indiana Avenue, NW, in downtown Washington is an unprepossessing six-story gray brick building that serves as police headquarters for the district. The Homicide Branch office is on the third floor. While Paul Yerby was being photographed and fingerprinted, Detective Reese went to see Captain Otto Miller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we got a break in the Monroe Arms case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller leaned back in his chair. \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I picked up the girl\u0027s boyfriend.

The papers will love this.\" Captain Miller took a deep breath. \"Why don\u0027t you think the boy\u0027s guilty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He admits he was in the girl\u0027s suite, but he said she told him to leave because she was expecting someone. I think the kid\u0027s too smart to come up with a story that stupid. What I do believe is that he knows who Chloe Houston was expecting. He won\u0027t say who it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was her first time in Washington, and they were on a tour of the White House. She didn\u0027t know anyone here. She said she was going to the ladies\u0027 room. There is no public rest room in the White House. She would have had to go outside to the Visitor\u0027s Pavilion on the Ellipse at 15th and E streets or to the White House Visitor Center. She was gone about fifteen minutes. What I think happened is that while trying to find a ladies\u0027 room, she ran into someone in the White House, someone she might have recognized. Maybe someone she saw on TV. Anyway, it must have been somebody important. He led her to a private washroom and impressed her enough that she agreed to meet him at the Monroe Arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Miller was thoughtful. \"I\u0027d better call the White House.

A few minutes later, he was saying, \"Yes, sir. We have a material witness in custody. He\u0027s in a holding cell at the Indiana Avenue police station....We won\u0027t, sir. I think the boy will give us the man\u0027s name tomorrow... Yes, sir. I understand.\" The line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Miller sighed and went back to the pile of papers on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt eight o\u0027clock the following morning, when Detective Nick Reese went to Paul Yerby\u0027s cell, Yerby\u0027s body was hanging from one of the top bars. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-best-laid-plans/page-17.html","bookId":2367,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM"}
