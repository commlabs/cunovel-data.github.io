He was aware that the reason a huge battle did not erupt today was because the Heaven Seat King and Second Seat King had not revealed themselves. Additionally, the Cosmic Evil Devil King had also yet to recover its fighting strength. Devil Prison naturally would not choose to start a war at such a time.

Unknowingly, a black armoured figure was already lazily sitting in it. The latter lifted her unusually deep and pretty black eyes and scanned everyone. Finally, she paused on Ying Huanhuan. Only then did a smile surface on her face, “Little junior sister, it has been a long time since we last saw each other.

How could anything possibly happen to me.” The Darkness Master smilingly said. She glanced at Lin Dong by the side and surprise flashed across her eyes. “Not bad little fellow. You actually reached the Reincarnation stage. However, there is still a big gap between you and little junior sister. Back then, you swore…”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Senior sister.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Huanhuan’s crescent like eyebrows bunched together.
