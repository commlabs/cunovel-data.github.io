Rivulets of water streamed in, and the ground became muddy even in their sheltered little place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not the life I envisioned,\" a glum Morik remarked. \"How the mighty have fallen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar smirked at his friend and shook his head. He was not as concerned with physical comforts as Morik, for the rain hardly bothered him. He had grown up in Icewind Dale, after all, a climate more harsh by far than anything the foothills on this side of the Spine of the World could offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027ve ruined my best breeches,\" Morik grumbled, turning around and slapping the mud from his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The farmers would have offered us shelter,\" Wulfgar reminded him. Earlier that day, the pair had passed clusters of farmhouses, and Wulfgar had mentioned several times that the folk within would likely offer them food and a warm place to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the farmers would know of us,\" Morik said by way of explanation, the same answer he had given each time Wulfgar had brought up the possibility. \"If or when we have someone looking for us, our trail would be easier to follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bolt of lightning split a tree a hundred yards away, bringing a startled cry from Morik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You act as though you expect half the militias of the region to be chasing us before long,\" Wulfgar replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have made many enemies,\" Morik admitted, \"as have you, my friend, including one of the leading magistrates of Luskan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar shrugged; he hardly cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll make more, I assure you,\" Morik went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the life you have chosen for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rogue cocked an eyebrow. \"Are we to live as farmers, tilling dirt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that be so terrible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik snorted, and Wulfgar only chuckled again helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need a base,\" Morik announced suddenly as another rivulet found its way to his bottom. \"A house . . . or a cave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are many caves in the mountains,\" Wulfgar offered. The look on Morik\u0027s face, both hopeful and fearful, told him he needn\u0027t speak the thought: mountain caves were almost always occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was up the next morning, shining bright in a blue sky, but that did little to change Morik\u0027s complaining mood. He grumbled and slapped at the dirt, then stripped off his clothes and washed them when the pair came across a clear mountain stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar, too, washed his clothes and his dirty body. The icy water felt good against his injured shoulder. Lying on a sunny rock waiting for their clothes to dry, Wulfgar spotted some smoke drifting lazily into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More houses,\" the barbarian remarked. \"Friendly folk to those who come as friends, no doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never stop,\" Morik replied dryly, and he reached behind the rock and pulled out a bottle of wine he had cooling in the water. He took a drink and offered it to Wulfgar, who hesitated, then accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after, their clothes still wet, and both a bit lightheaded, the pair started off along the mountain trails. They couldn\u0027t take their wagon, so they stashed it under some brush and let the horses graze nearby, with Morik noting the irony of how easy it would be for someone to rob them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we would just have to steal them back,\" Wulfgar replied, and Morik started to laugh, missing the barbarian\u0027s sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped abruptly, though, noting the suddenly serious expression on his large friend\u0027s face. Following Wulfgar\u0027s gaze to the trail ahead, Morik began to understand, for he spotted a broken sapling, recently snapped just above the trunk. Wulfgar went to the spot and bent low, studying the ground around the sapling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think broke the tree?\" Morik asked from behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar motioned for the rogue to join him, then pointed out the heel print of a large, large boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giants?\" Morik asked, and Wulfgar looked at him curiously. Already Wulfgar recognized the signs of Morik becoming unhinged, as the rogue had over the rat in the cage at Prisoner\u0027s Carnival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like giants, either?\" Wulfgar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik shrugged. \"I have never seen one,\" he admitted, \"but who truly likes them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar stared at him incredulously. Morik was a seasoned veteran, skilled as a thief and warrior. A significant portion of Wulfgar\u0027s own training had come at the expense of giants. To think one as skilled as Morik had never even seen one surprised the barbarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw an ogre once,\" Morik said. \"Of course, our gaoler friends had more than a bit of ogre blood in them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bigger,\" Wulfgar said bluntly. \"Giants are much bigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik blanched. \"Let us return the way we came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there are giants about, they\u0027ll very likely have a lair,\" Wulfgar explained. \"Giants would not suffer rain and hot sun when there are comfortable caves in the region. Besides, they prefer their meals cooked, and they try not to advertise their presence with campfires under the open sky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their meals,\" Morik echoed. \"Are barbarians and thieves on their menu of cooked meals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A delicacy,\" Wulfgar said earnestly, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us go and speak with the farmers,\" said Morik, turning around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coward,\" Wulfgar remarked quietly. The word had Morik spinning back to face him. \"The trail is easy enough to follow,\" Wulfgar explained. \"We don\u0027t even know how many there are. Never would I have expected Morik the Rogue to run from a fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morik the rogue fights with this,\" Morik countered, poking his finger against his temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A giant would eat that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Morik the Rogue runs with his feet,\" the thief said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A giant would catch you,\" Wulfgar assured him. \"Or it would throw a rock at you and squash you from afar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleasant choices,\" said Morik cynically. \"Let us go and speak with the farmers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar settled back on his heels, studying his friend and making no move to follow. He couldn\u0027t help but contrast Morik to Drizzt at that moment. The rogue was turning to leave, while the drow would, and often had, eagerly rushed headlong into such adventure as a giant lair. Wulfgar recalled the time he and Drizzt had dispatched an entire lair of verbeeg, a long and brutal fight but one that Drizzt had entered laughing. Wulfgar thought of the last fight he had waged beside his ebon-skinned friend, against another band of giants. That time they\u0027d chased them into the mountains after learning that the brutes had set their eyes on the road to Ten-Towns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to Wulfgar that Morik and Drizzt were similar in so many way, but in the most important ways they were nothing alike. It was a contrast that continually nagged at Wulfgar, a reminder of the startling differences in his life now, the difference between that world north of the Spine of the World and this world south of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There may only be a couple of giants,\" Wulfgar suggested. \"They rarely gather in large numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik pulled out his slender sword and his dagger. \"A hundred hits to fell one?\" he asked. \"Two hundred? And all the time I spend sticking the behemoth two hundred times, I\u0027ll be comforted by the thought that one strike from the giant will crush me flat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar\u0027s grin widened. \"That\u0027s the fun of it,\" he offered. The barbarian hoisted the headman\u0027s axe over one shoulder and started after the giant, having little trouble in discerning the trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouching on the backside of a wide boulder by mid-afternoon, Wulfgar and Morik had the giants and their lair in sight. Even Morik had to admit that the location was perfect: an out-of-the-way cave nestled among rocky crests, yet less than half a day\u0027s march to one of two primary mountain passes, the easternmost of the pair, separating Icewind Dale from the southlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched for a long while and noted only a pair of giants, then a third appeared. Even so, Wulfgar was not impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hill giants,\" he remarked disparagingly, \"and only a trio. I have battled a single mountain giant who could fell all three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let us see if we can find that mountain giant and prompt him to come and evict this group,\" said Morik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That mountain giant is dead,\" Wulfgar replied. \"As these three shall soon be.\" He took up the huge axe in hand and glanced about, finally deciding on a roundabout trail that would bring him to the lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea of how to fight them,\" Morik whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch and learn,\" Wulfgar replied, and off he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik didn\u0027t know whether he should follow or not, so he stayed put on the rock, noting his friend\u0027s progress, watching the trio of giants disappear into the cave. Wulfgar crept up to that dark entrance soon after, slipping to the edge and peering in. Glancing back Morik\u0027s way, he went spinning into the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t even know if there are others inside,\" Morik muttered to himself, shaking his head. He wondered if coming out here with Wulfgar had been a wise idea after all. The rogue could get back into Luskan easily, he knew, with a new identity as far as the authorities were concerned, but with the same old position of respect on the streets. Of course, there remained the not-so-little matter of the dark elves who had come calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, given the size of those giants, Morik was thinking that he just might have to return to Luskan. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial passageway inside the cave was not very high on open, at least for giants. Wulfgar took comfort in the knowledge that his adversaries would have to stoop very low, perhaps even crawl, to get under one overhanging boulder. Pursuit would not be swift if Wulfgar were forced to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel widened and heightened considerably beyond that curving walk of about fifty feet. After that it opened into a wide, high chamber where a tremendous bonfire reflected enough orange light down the tunnel so that Wulfgar was not walking in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted that the walls were broken and uneven, a place of shadows. There was one particularly promising perch about ten feet off the ground. Wulfgar crept along a bit farther, hoping to catch a glimpse of the entire giant clan within. He wanted to make sure that there were only three and that they didn\u0027t have any of the dangerous pets giants often harbored, like cave bears or huge wolves. The barbarian had to backtrack, though, before he even got near the chamber entrance, for he heard one of the giants approaching, belching with every booming step. Wulfgar went up the wall to the perch and melted back into the shadows to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut came the giant, rubbing its belly and belching yet again. It stooped and bent in preparation for the tight stretch of corridor ahead. Caution dictated that Wulfgar hold his attack, that he scout further and discern the exact strength of his enemy, but Wulfgar wasn\u0027t feeling cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown he came with a great roar and a tremendous overhead chop of the headsman\u0027s axe, his pure strength adding to the momentum of the drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe startled giant managed a slight dodge, enough so that the axe didn\u0027t sheer through its neck. Despite its great size, Wulfgar\u0027s power would have decapitated the behemoth. Still, the axe drove through the giant\u0027s shoulder-blade, tearing skin and muscle and crushing bone, knocking the giant into a howling, agonized stagger that left it crouched on one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the process, Wulfgar\u0027s weapon snapped at mid-shaft. Ever one to improvise, the barbarian hit the ground in a roll, came right back to his feet, and rushed in on the wounded, kneeling giant, stabbing it hard in the throat with the pointed, broken end of the shaft. As the gurgling behemoth reached for him with huge, trembling hands, Wulfgar tore the shaft free, tightened his grip on the end, and smashed the giant across the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the giant there on one knee, knowing that its friends would soon come out. Looking for a defensible position, he noticed then that the action of his attack, or perhaps the landing on the floor, had re-opened his shoulder wound, his tunic already growing wet with fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar didn\u0027t have time to think about it. He made it back to his high perch as the other two entered the area below him. He found his next weapon in the form of a huge rock. With a stifled grunt, Wulfgar brought it up overhead and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last giant in line, the smallest of the three, heard that grunt and looked up just as Wulfgar brought the rock smashing down-and how that giant howled!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar scooped his club and leaped down, once again using his momentum to heighten the strike as he smashed this one across the face. The barbarian hit the floor and pivoted back at the behemoth, rushing past its legs to smash at its kneecaps. Altering his grip, he stabbed hard at the tender hamstrings on the back of the giant\u0027s legs, just as Bruenor had taught him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill holding its smashed face and howling in pain, the giant tumbled to the ground behind Wulfgar, where it fell in the way of the last of the group, the only one who had not yet felt the sting of Wulfgar\u0027s weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the cave, Morik winced as he heard the cries and the groans, the howls and the unmistakable sound of boulder against bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious despite himself, the rogue moved up closer to the entrance, trying to get a look inside, though he feared and honestly believed that his friend was already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be well on your way to Luskan,\" Morik scolded himself under his breath. \"A warm bed for Morik tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d hit them as hard as he could both times, yet he hadn\u0027t killed a single one of the trio, probably hadn\u0027t even knocked one of them out of the fight for long. Here he was, exposed and running into the main chamber without even knowing if the place had another exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut memories of Errtu weren\u0027t with the barbarian now. He was temporarily free of that emotional bondage, on the very edge of present desperation, and he loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once luck was with him. Inside the lair proper Wulfgar found the spoils of the giants\u0027 last raid, including the remains of a trio of dwarves, one of whom had carried a small, though solid hammer and another with several hand axes set along a bandolier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoaring, the giant rushed in, and Wulfgar let fly one, two, three, with the hand axes, scoring two gouging hits. Still the brute came on, and it was only a single running stride away when a desperate Wulfgar, thinking he was about to get squished into the wall, spun the hammer right into its thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar dived desperately, for the staggering giant couldn\u0027t begin to halt its momentum. It slammed headlong into the stone wall, dropping more than a bit of dust and pebbles from the cave ceiling. Somehow Wulfgar managed to avoid the crunch, but he had left his new weapons behind and couldn\u0027t possibly get to them in time as the giant Wulfgar had smashed with the rock came limping into the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar went for the snapped axe shaft instead. Scooping it up, he dived aside in another roll as the behemoth stomped down with a heavy boot. Wulfgar was already in motion, charging for those vulnerable knees, smashing one repeatedly, then spinning about the trunklike leg, out of the giant\u0027s grasp. Turning his weapon point out as he pivoted, he stabbed again at the back of the bloodied leg. The giant lying against the wall kicked out, clipping Wulfgar\u0027s wounded shoulder and launching the man away to slam hard against the far wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar was in his warrior rage now. He came out of the slam with a bellow, charging right back at the limping behemoth too fast for it to recognize the movement. His relentless club went at the knees again, and though the giant slapped at him, Wulfgar took hope in finally hearing the bone crunch apart. Down went the behemoth, clutching its broken knee, the sheer volume of its cries shaking the entire cave. Shaking off the dull ache of that slap, Wulfgar taunted it with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one against the wall tried to rise, but Wulfgar was there in an instant, standing on its back, his club battering it about the back of the head. He scored several thunderous hits and had the behemoth flat down and trying to cover. Wulfgar dared hope he might finally finish one off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the huge hand of the other giant tightened about his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik could hardly believe his movements, felt as if his own feet were betraying him, as he crept right up to the cave entrance and peered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the first of the giant group, standing bent over at the waist under the overhanging rock, one arm extended against the wall to lend support as it coughed up the last remnants of blood from its mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore his own good sense could overrule him, Morik was on the move, silently creeping into the gloom of the cave along the wall. He got by the giant with hardly a whisper of sound, his small noises easily covered by the giant\u0027s hacking and wheezing, then climbed to a ledge several feet from the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of battle rang out from the inner chamber, and he could only hope that Wulfgar was doing well, both for his friend\u0027s sake and because he realized that if the other giants came out now he would be in a difficult position indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rogue held his nerve, and waited, poised, dagger in hand, lining up his strike. He considered the attack from the perspective of those backstabs he knew from his experiences fighting men, but he looked at his puny dagger doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant began to turn around. Morik was out of time. Knowing he had to be perfect, figuring that this was going to hurt more than a little, and wondering why in the Nine Hells he had come in here after foolish Wulfgar, Morik went with his instinct and leaped for the giant\u0027s torn throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dagger flashed. The giant howled and leaped up-and slammed its head on the overhanging boulder. Groaning, it tried to straighten, flailing its arms, and Morik flew aside, his breath blasted away. Half-tumbling, half-running, and surely screaming, Morik exited the cave with the gasping, grasping giant right behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the giant closing, step by step. At the last instant Morik dived aside and the behemoth stumbled past, one hand clutching its throat, wheezing horribly, its face blue, eyes bulging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik sprinted back the other way, but the giant didn\u0027t pursue. The huge creature was down on its knees now, gasping for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going home to Luskan,\" Morik mumbled over and over, but he kept moving for the cave entrance as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar spun and stabbed with all his strength, then drove ahead ferociously, twisting and pulling at the giant\u0027s leg. The giant was on one knee, its broken leg held out straight as it struggled to maintain some balance. The other meaty hand came at Wulfgar, but he slipped under it and pulled on furiously, breaking free and leaping to the giant\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambled behind the behemoth\u0027s head and wrapped his hands back around, lining up the point of his axe shaft with the creature\u0027s eye. Wulfgar locked his hands around that splintered pole and pushed hard. The giant\u0027s hands grabbed at him to stop his progress, but he growled and pulled on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terrified giant tried to wriggle away, pulled with its huge hands with all its strength, bunched muscle that would stop nearly any human cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Wulfgar had the angle and was possessed of a strength beyond that of nearly any human. He saw the other giant climbing back to its feet, but reminded himself to take the fight one at a time. Wulfgar felt the tip of his axe shaft sink into the giant\u0027s eye. It went into a frenzy, even climbing back to its feet, but Wulfgar held on. Driving, driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant ran blindly for the wall and turned around, going in hard, trying to crush the man. Wulfgar growled away the pain and pressed on with all his strength until the spear slipped in deeper to the behemoth\u0027s brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other giant came in then. Wulfgar fell away, scrambling across the chamber, using the spasms of the dying giant to cover his retreat. The butt end of Wulfgar\u0027s impromptu spear remained visible within the folds of the dying brute\u0027s closed eyelid. Wulfgar scarcely had time to notice as he dived headlong across the way to retrieve the hammer and one of the bloody hand axes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant threw its dead companion aside and strode forward, then staggered back with a hand axe embedded deep into its forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar continued to press in with a mighty overhead chop that slammed the hammer hard into the behemoth\u0027s chest. He hit it again, and a third time, then went down under the flailing fists and struck a brutal blow against the giant\u0027s knee. Wulfgar skittered past and ran behind the brute to the wall, leaping upward two full strides, then springing off with yet another wicked, downward smash as the turning giant came around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hammer\u0027s head cracked through the giant\u0027s skull. The behemoth dropped straight down and lay very still on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik entered the chamber at that moment and gaped at the battered Wulfgar. The barbarian\u0027s shoulder was soaked with blood, his leg bruised from ankle to thigh, and his knees and hands were skinned raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see?\" Wulfgar said with a triumphant grin. \"No trouble at all. Now we have a home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik looked past his friend to the gruesome remains of the half-eaten dwarves and the two dead giants oozing blood throughout the chamber. \"Such as it is,\" he answered dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent the better part of the next three days cleaning out their cave, burying the dwarves, chopping up and disposing of the giants, and retrieving their supplies. They even managed to get the horses and the wagon up to the place along a roundabout route, though they simply let the horses run free after the great effort, figuring that they would never be very useful as a pulling team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full pack on his back, Morik took Wulfgar out along the trails. The pair finally came to a spot overlooking a wide pass, the one true trail through this region of the Spine of the World. It was the same trail that Wulfgar and his former friends had used whenever they\u0027d ventured out of Icewind Dale. There was another pass to the west that ran through Hundelstone, but this was the most direct route, though more dangerous by far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many caravans will roll through this place before winter,\" Morik explained. \"They\u0027ll be heading north with varied goods and south with scrimshaw knucklehead carvings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore familiar with the routine than Morik would ever understand, Wulfgar merely nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should hit them both ways,\" the rogue suggested. \"Secure our provisions from those coming from the south and our future monies from those coming from the north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar sat down on a slab and stared north along the pass, beyond it to Icewind Dale. He was reminded again of the sharp contrast between his past and his present. How ironic it would be if his former friends were the ones to track down the highwaymen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pictured Bruenor, roaring as he charged up the rocky slope, agile Drizzt skipping past him, scimitars in hand. Guenhwyvar would already be above them, Wulfgar knew, cutting off any retreat. Morik would likely flee, and Catti-brie would cut him down with a single, blazing arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look a thousand miles away. What\u0027s on your mind?\" Morik inquired. As usual, he was holding an open bottle he\u0027d already begun sampling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking I need a drink,\" Wulfgar replied, taking the bottle and lifting it to his lips. Burning all the way down, the huge swallow helped calm him somewhat, but he still couldn\u0027t reconcile himself to his present position. Perhaps his friends would come after him, as he, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar, and the others following, had gone after the giant band they suspected to be highwaymen in Icewind Dale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar took another long drink. He didn\u0027t like the prospects if they came after him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-17.html","bookId":2132,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM"}
