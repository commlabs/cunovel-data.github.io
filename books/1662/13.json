The figure moved out of the dark shadows and a stretch of moonlight bounced off a gold and blue watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach sunk all the way to my toes. What in the hell was he doing here? Had Dee invited him? I hadn’t told her what had happened between us, but there was no doubt she had heard the rumors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katy, is that you?” He staggered to the side and leaned against the house. Fully visible, he had a swollen-shut eye that was an ugly shade of violet. Bruises marred his jaw. A lip was split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped. “What happened to your face?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon lifted a flask to his mouth. “Your boyfriend happened to my face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a drink, wincing. “Daemon Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not my boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” Simon inched closer. “I came here to talk…to you. You’ve got to call him off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. When Daemon said he’d take care of the problem, he hadn’t been screwing around. Part of me felt bad for the dude, but it was overshadowed by the fact he and his friends had half the school calling me a skank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to tell him I didn’t mean anything that night. I’m…sorry.” He lurched forward, dropping the flask. Jesus. Daemon must’ve put the fear of God in him. “You’ve got to tell him I set everyone straight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back as the wave of alcohol and desperation crashed into me. “Simon, I think you should sit down or something, because—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to tell him.” He grabbed my arm with damp, beefy fingers. “People are starting to talk. I can’t…have that kind of shit being said about me. Tell him or else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hairs on the back of my neck rose. Fury tore through me like a speeding bullet. I wouldn’t be pushed around or threatened. Not by Simon or anyone. “Or else what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad’s a lawyer.” His hand tightened as he swayed. “He’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of things happened next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pitched toward me, too close, and my heart sped up. A horrible cracking sound deafened my ears. Four of the five windows we stood next to trembled and then cracked. A large, jagged fracture streaked down the middle of each window, and then small ones spread out until the entire windows shuddered under the unseen force and exploded, sending shards of glass raining down on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon yelped as he lurched from the falling glass. “What the hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruck by absolute horror, I stood motionless. Simon shook his arms and more glass fell away from his clothes. Little pieces slid through my hair, some falling out and others getting stuck in the tangled waves. My arm felt like someone pinched me, and I knew Dee’s dress was torn. The other window shuddered. I didn’t know how to control it. The pane continued to tremble violently. There was another loud crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacking up, Simon glanced from the windows and then to me. His glassy eyes were wide. “You…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t catch my breath. There was a faint reddish-white glow creeping into my vision. The remaining window on the second floor vibrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace pale, he stumbled over his own feet, falling to the ground. “You’re…you’re glowing. You—you freak!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glowing? “No! It’s not me. I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s not me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambled to his feet, and I took a step toward him. He threw up his hand and wobbled. “Stay away from me! Just stay away from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to do anything, I watched him stagger around the house. A car door opened and an engine roared to life. A distant part of my brain told me I needed to stop him, because he was obviously too drunk to drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the top window exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCringing, I shielded my face as glass rained down, pinging off the ground and me. My breath sawed in and out of my chest until the very last piece of glass landed. I stood there, mortified and frightened by what I’d done. Not only did I expose my freak-o abilities again, I’d almost turned Simon into a pincushion. Man, I was so screwed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes passed before I straightened and picked my way around the shattered glass, making my way into the heavy tree line. A fine sheen of cold sweat dotted my forehead and residual fear kept hitting me low in the stomach. What had I done? When my house came into sight, I felt the familiar tingle along my neck. Branches and leaves crunched, and I turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s steps slowed as he spotted me. He pushed a low-hanging branch aside as he neared. “What are you doing out here, Kat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral moments passed before I could speak. “I just blew up a bunch of windows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Daemon moved closer, eyes widening. “You’re bleeding. What happened?” He paused. “Where are your shoes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at my feet. “I took them off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, Daemon was beside me, knocking off tiny pieces of glass. “Kat, what happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting my head, I sucked in a sharp breath. Full-blown panic squeezed my chest. “I was walking and I ran into Simon—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he do this to you?” His voice was so low it sent shivers through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No! I ran into him, and he was upset about you.” I paused, my eyes searching his. “He said you beat him up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I did.” No apology in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon, you can’t beat up guys because they talk badly about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I can.” His hand clenched at his side. “He deserved it. I’m not going to lie. I did it because of what he was saying. It was bullshit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea what to say. Ha. Me. Speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He knows what he did—what he tried to do—and to spin that around on you?” Daemon eye’s flitted to the shadows seeping among the trees. “I’m not going to let some punk-ass human talk about you like that, especially him or his friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” I murmured, blinking rapidly. Sometimes I forgot how protective Daemon could be…or how downright scary. “I don’t think I’m supposed to say thank you, because that seems wrong, but, um, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, that’s not important. What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking several deep breaths, I let the words come out in a rush. When I was done, Daemon wrapped an arm around me, tugging me against his chest. I didn’t resist him, pressing my face into him and clutching his sides, feeling safer in his embrace than I did any place else. And I couldn’t blame the connection for that. Even before it was formed, his arms had always been a sanctuary of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you didn’t do it on purpose, Kitten.” His hand pressed a soothing circle against my back. “Simon was drunk, so there’s a good chance he won’t even remember. And if he does, no one will believe him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope sparked. “You think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. People will think he’s crazy.” Daemon pulled back, lowering his head so we were eye level. “No one will believe him, okay? And if he starts to talk, I’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll do nothing.” I shimmied free, drawing a deep breath. “I think you’ve already scarred the boy for life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously not,” he muttered. “What were you thinking back there? You were upset. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat infused my cheeks, and I started walking toward my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon let out a long, suffering sigh. He was right beside me. “Kat, talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can make it back home without your help, thank you very much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held a branch out of the way so I could pass under it. “I would hope so. It is right there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn’t you be making out with Ash right now anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me like I’d grown two heads. I recognized my mistake immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what all of this is about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It had nothing to do with you—or her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re jealous.” He sounded smug. “I’m so going to win this bet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stomped forward. “Me? Jealous? You’ve lost your mind. I wasn’t the one trying to scare off Blake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my arm, stopping me just as my porch came into sight. “Who cares about Ben?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blake,” I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever. I thought you didn’t like me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand curled in the air. There was no breaking his hold. “You’re right. I don’t like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger flared in his eyes. “You’re lying—blushing cheeks and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst case of verbal diarrhea happened. “You were kissing me a few days ago and now you were having fun with Ash? Is this what you normally do? Jump from one girl to the next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” He dropped my arm. “That’s not what I do. I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I hate to break it to you, but you are doing it.” And so had I. What was I doing? I couldn’t be mad at him when I had done the same thing, but I was. It was ridiculous. “God, I am being such a whiny girl. Just forget I said anything. You can do whatever you want and I don’t have any right—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon cursed, dropping my arm. “Okay. You have no idea what was going on between Ash and me. We were only talking. She was messing with you, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” I whirled around, walking again. “I’m not jealous. I don’t care if you and Ash make alien babies together. I don’t care. And honestly, if it weren’t for this stupid connection, you wouldn’t even enjoy kissing me. You probably already don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was suddenly in front of me. I took an involuntary step back. “Do you think I didn’t enjoy kissing you? That I haven’t thought about it every second since then? And I know you have. Just admit it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pit of my stomach, tight coils thrummed. “What is the point of this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, for crap’s sake, yes, I have. I do! Do you want me to write it down for you? Send you an e-mail or a text? Will that make you feel better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon arched a brow. “You don’t need to be sarcastic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you don’t need to be here. Ash is waiting for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head to the side in exasperation. “Do you really think I’m going to go to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, yeah, I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat.” He shook his head, his voice a soft denial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter.” I took a deep breath. “Can we just forget this? Please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon smoothed a finger over his brow. “I can’t forget this and neither can you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, I turned on my heel and stalked toward my house. I half expected him to stop me, but after a few successful steps away I realized he wasn’t going to. I had to fight turning around to see if he still stood there. I’d made enough of a fool of myself tonight. Kicked a hissy fit over Ash and Daemon, stormed out of the party, and nearly decapitated Simon. All of this before midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-13.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
