She underlined her last words with a theatrical flourish. “You know, making lists is one of the seven habits of highly effective people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, I’m used to your lists,” her father said. “You started making them as soon as you could spell. But your suitcase—you packed all your clothes by color.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her open suitcase on the bed. The whites were nestled at one end, the blacks at the other, with the brighter shades in between. Shrugging, Cecily said, “Well, how do you do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAffectionately he tousled her hair. This was slightly annoying, because she’d just fixed her ponytail, but Cecily didn’t worry about it for very long. She was much more worried about the fact that her father had caught sight of something unusual in her suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the vial of moth wings and frowned. “What is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh.” Cecily tried to think of a lie, but she couldn’t. “Um…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression shifted from curiosity to disgust. “Cecily, are these—bug wings?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell him the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Flushed with daring, Cecily added, “They’re moth wings for magic spells.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad stared at her. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cecily, don’t tease your father.” Her mother stepped into Cecily’s bedroom and briskly took the jar. “Simon, these are soap flakes. Bubble bath. They make them look like moth wings and eye of newt and all that sort of magical stuff now. I think it’s some Harry Potter thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Harry Potter.” Dad chuckled. “Those merchandising guys don’t miss a trick, do they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom tucked the jar back into the suitcase and shot her daughter a warning look. But her voice was cheery as she said, “Let’s hurry up, guys. We should leave for the airport in about fifteen minutes. Sweetheart, would you check on Theo? The last time I saw him, he was trying to sneak Pudge into his carry-on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For Christ’s sake.” Dad started down the hall. “All we need is for the Department of Homeland Security to detain us because of the hamster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as her father was out of earshot, her mother muttered, “Do we have to have this talk again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m really sorry I endangered all our lives.” Cecily tossed her hair melodramatically, clutching her hands in front of her chest like a silent-movie heroine. “What if Dad tries to have us burned at the stake? Whatever shall we do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Load your bag in the car, all right? And don’t even think about pulling a stunt like that once we get to North Carolina. The others aren’t going to cut you as much slack as I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother hurried off, unbothered by the latest in their many tiffs on this subject. But Cecily felt angry with herself for making a joke of it instead of trying to talk this through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually she tried hard to respect the rules of the Craft, rules Cecily had memorized before she’d turned eight years old. Most of the rules were sensible—the necessary reins on the incredible powers that they worked with. The fact that she knew those rules backward and forward was one reason that she was already a fine witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Cecily’s opinion there was another reason. She didn’t only memorize the rules; she pushed herself to understand the reasons behind them. For instance, it was one thing to know that the Craft forbade witches to use their powers to undermine the wills of others; it was another to understand why that was wrong and how misusing the powers that way would corrode both your ability and your soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there was one rule Cecily could never understand, the oldest of them all: No man may know the truth behind the Craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad—who knew nothing about the single most important thing in the lives of his wife and his daughter—called, “We’ve got to drop Pudge off at the O’Farrells and get to the airport within one hour. Unless nobody wants to go to the beach house this year!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-11.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
