He looked frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shrugged. \"I\u0027ve never been able to pinpoint his location.

Was she delaying the Ceremony just because of the baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack could be in jail, for all we know,\" Eddie added. \"We\u0027ve got to get this done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" the Lady said. \"We have all we need here to perform the Ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked around the room. Looked like she was outvoted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"All right.
