{"id":15867,"no":8,"title":"Chapter VIII--Again Awake","content":"\u0026nbsp;When I was again aware of living I heard things hazily, quite as if there were a thick wall between me and the voices of the people who stood so anxiously bending over me. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I tell you, Archie, the child was strangled,” I heard Aunt Penelope say. “And Heaven only knows what may happen next, with all the Bolsheviki around--can’t you do something (Amy, put down that revolver, you are driving me crazy!)--and Evelyn, right in the next room, hearing nothing. . . . And said she wasn’t asleep. . . . Amy, if you don’t sit down I will scream! And Ito, right in the pantry, by the fire-escape, on which he must have climbed (if it was a he), and how he got up I don’t know. . . . And you say there’s no danger, doctor? . . . The only child of my dear dead sister, and what will happen next? . . . The only thing, of course, is to remain calm (Amy, can’t you stop wiggling? There are limits.), and I suppose to maintain calm is the only sensible proceeding---- What was that?” She screamed the last, and I sat up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor was almost rude about telling her to be quiet. And then he ordered them all out and sat down on the edge of my bed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Anyone you especially want to see?” he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I said I didn’t think so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sure?” he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’d better not sit with your back to the window,” I advised. Then he took hold of my hand. “There is no danger in windows,” he said in a level, awfully sure voice. “What hurt you won’t hurt you again. . .” And he said it so that I believed him at the time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now about someone to sit with you to-night. The ladies, it seems, all have engagements, and I’ve urged them to keep them. Thought the normal might give them a balance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I’ll be all right,” I answered. “Jane can look in once in a while.” But without meaning to I looked at the window. The doctor frowned, and I was ashamed. I told him about how I had been chased and that that had upset me a little. And that I was usually brave. He said he thought I was splendid, and that he wasn’t angry with me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sam Kempwood who helped you out of that scrape?” he questioned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I nodded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Bully chap,” he said. “I know him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I said I thought he was one of the nicest men that I’d ever met. That you could tell it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Suppose he comes up and plays nurse?” the doctor suggested.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I smiled. “That would be lovely,” I admitted after a long breath, for even then I really loved Mr. Kempwood, “but I am sure it will bore him. You see, I don’t know how to entertain people the way my cousin Evelyn does.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the doctor said that I was to be entertained, and that he’d stop at Mr. Kempwood’s on the way down. And then he wrapped me up in a pink comforter and carried me out to the living-room, where he put me on a wide lounge which stands before the fire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now Hannah, or Molly, or whatever your name is,” he said to Jane, “you stay with this child until I come back.” And Jane did, but she wasn’t much help. She was so awfully frightened and kept jumping and looking around. . . . In just a few moments the bell rang, and I heard the men in the hall. . . . “Just a little while will change the trend and help her,” the doctor said. “The rest have cleared out and good riddance! Weren’t any good. . . . Awfully decent of you, Kempwood.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not a bit of it,” said Mr. Kempwood; “hadn’t anything to do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, don’t make a long business of it,” said the doctor; “just a few moments will help. The child’s evident admiration for you led me to think that you could help her most.” And then they stopped talking and tiptoed in. I smiled at Mr. Kempwood and tried to tell him how grateful I was to him for coming up, but it was not easy to talk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never mind about that,” he said gently. And then he sat down by me, and showed me some pictures which I couldn’t see very well, because my sight was so blurred.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Suppose,” he said, “we’re quiet----” And I nodded. And then he took hold of my hand and patted it, and it helped a great deal. And I don’t know how it happened, but, somehow, I was telling him how I had hated coming to New York, how I missed Uncle Frank and Bradly-dear, and about the cricket that stays in the earth for three years. Then my eyes filled--I could feel them--and I whispered: “It’s only been three days.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My dear child!” he answered, and I could see he was awfully sorry for me. He patted terribly hard. That helped too, but it made me smile. After that one tear slipped over the edge, and, because I hadn’t a handkerchief, he wiped it off with his. I thanked him very much, and then I said: “I don’t ever cry.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I see,” he answered, and he smiled, but so gently that I didn’t mind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I said: “I don’t really. That is, not when I’m well. I hadn’t before to-night for ages.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You didn’t to-night,” he answered, and so cheerfully. “?‘One swallow doesn’t make a summer,’ so certainly one tear doesn’t make a cry!” And I was so glad he thought I hadn’t.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When you want to cry hard,” I confided further, “swallowing very quickly again and again will stall it. It’s a great help----”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he said: “You little sport!” And I began to feel happier. He looked at me so nicely, it warmed me up, and my throat began to feel better. I asked him when he had to go, and he said not until I was so sick of him that I would have Jane throw him out. Then again we were quiet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look here,” he said after a few moments, “don’t you like baseball?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I nodded as hard as my stiff throat would let me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well,” he went on, “don’t you think your aunt would let you go to the big games with me next year?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I sat up. “Oh,” I said, “if she only would!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We’ll see that she will. But that’s a long way off. We’ll have to have good times before that. Ever been to the Hippodrome?” I said I hadn’t, and he described it. I became very interested, for it sounded like a sort of glorified circus. I had to lie down again, for I began to feel dizzy and sick, but he went right on talking of it as he arranged the pillows for me and made me comfortable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then I thought of the bracelet and asked for Jane. Mr. Kempwood rang, and she came. I told her I wanted a white satin box that stood on my bureau, and asked her please to get it. When she brought it back I held it for several minutes without opening it, and then I shut my eyes and felt. The bracelet was there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I put it on, and then after a little interval I told Mr. Kempwood the whole story. I couldn’t talk loudly, but he leaned over and got it all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Dear child,” he said, “that’s utter nonsense.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I looked at it and shook my head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Give it to me,” he said; “I have a wall safe, and I’ll take charge of it for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I shook my head. “You said you’d take me to the league games,” I answered. “I’m not going to run any risks!” And then we both laughed. He did some more urgings, but I did not give in, for I knew that it was my battle, and I meant to fight it out. I didn’t think I could ever hold up my head if I evaded it, and then--I couldn’t bear the idea of its hurting Mr. Kempwood. I told him so. “And not entirely because of those games,” I admitted honestly, “but because I like you, a great deal.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He answered me quickly. “Natalie,” he said (I had told him my name as I related the story of the bracelet), “let’s be friends. For I like you too, and,” he added after a pause, “a great deal.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That began my friendship with Mr. Kempwood, which helped me in so many ways and came to mean so much.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3293/90059.html","bookId":458,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:19:02 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:19:02 AM"}
