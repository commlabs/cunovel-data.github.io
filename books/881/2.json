THE ICE-BOUND SHIP.","content":"Far down in the Antarctic Ocean a good ship was battling with heavy seas and a head wind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For weeks the whaler Albatross had been trying to make headway against the vigorous norther which constantly headed them off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But a few weeks more remained for them to get into northern seas before the winter would set in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Hardy had spent one winter among the ice and snow of the Antarctic and had no desire to spend another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ship was loaded down with whale oil, and pecuniarily the cruise bid fair to be a tremendous success.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But provisions were getting low, and to be nipped in the ice again meant a horrible fate, nothing short of starvation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Realizing this, it was little wonder that Captain Hardy paced the deck of his ship anxiously and studied the northern sky.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Jack Wallis!” he cried, in his bluff way, “it still blows, and, by Neptune, it looks likely to keep on. We can’t make seaway in such a wind. What are we going to do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack Wallis, the mate, was a tall, handsome fellow, with resolute blue eyes and Saxon complexion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was a favorite with the crew and brave as a lion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But his face now was a trifle pale. He realized the danger of their position quite as well as did Captain Hardy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was not thinking of his own safety, but of those aboard the ship and their prospective fate as well as the peril of a certain very charming young lady on board. No other than Lucille Hardy, the captain’s daughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The captain had yielded against his will to Lucille’s pleadings to be allowed to come on the voyage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knew better than she did the mighty risk involved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he had finally yielded, it was true that Lucille was the light of the ship. The crew to a man worshipped and revered her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two years under the Southern Cross was a long while to remain away from home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Lucille had been happy even in the monotonous routine of ship life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, however, when the prospect of being compelled to spend another winter in frozen latitudes confronted him Captain Hardy wished devoutly that he had left her at home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All this prospect, so dreadful, might have been averted had they started a month earlier for home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But striking a school of whales, the temptation to fill every barrel aboard had caused the captain to linger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In an ordinary season, however, he would yet have succeeded in getting beyond the circle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it seemed as if the fates themselves held the north wind in their hands. It had grown in fury for weeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now the cold had begun to set in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pack ice even showed itself, and the rigging was frozen at times, so that a block or stay could hardly be moved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No wonder the captain was anxious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We must bend every sail!” he declared, “Unless we get out of here this week it is winter quarters, and——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not finish the sentence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Something like a groan escaped his lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But every day the wind grew stiffer and the Albatross labored harder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was certain that she would never make the northern seas. A gloom settled down over ship and crew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sailors, brave fellows all, could not help a murmur.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many of them thought of their homes in the far North where dear ones were awaiting them. Alas! it looked as if they would never see them again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Day by day the vessel lost headway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then one day the black clouds shut in from the north and there came an ice storm, the like of which they had never seen before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was little use to attempt to face the wind now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All they could do was to keep the vessel steady and look out for a collision with drift ice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The nights were long sieges, with trying to keep the ship from being stove. The days were rigid battles against the careering blasts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the sun disappeared below the horizon. The Antarctic night had begun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no longer any hope of reaching northern waters that year.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Winter quarters was the order. In a remarkably brief space of time the tossing, turbulent sea had become a solid mass of pack ice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And in the midst of this her timbers grinding and wrenching with the strain lay the Albatross.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But soon the ice pack became motionless as the fearful cold contributed to make it solid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus fixed in her icy bed the Albatross was to remain a fixture for seven long dreary months.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was by no means a pleasant outlook. Yet the crew proceeded to make the best of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The rations were carefully reckoned up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was found that only with the most frugal of indulgence would they last until spring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But yet there was a chance that game might be procured to some extent. Even then, however, it was remembered that after the ice pack should break up it would be three months before they could hope to reach a port.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Therefore the outlook was serious indeed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Added to this was the almost absolute certainty of sickness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scurvy already threatened various members of the crew. Yet they did no yield to despair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a common conviction that the only hope of escape consisted in clinging together, and this they did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no mutiny, no recriminations, no quarrels. It was a common cause, and life was its stake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon the Antarctic winter with all its fearful rigors had set in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But they were quite comfortable aboard the ship, grouping about the furnace by the light of the oil lamps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Outside the cold was at times so severe as to have almost precluded a human being living in the open air a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there were many of these spells, and fortunately they were not of long duration.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At times the thermometer would go up with a rush and the air became quite mild.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At such times they dared to venture away from the ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hunts were organized and as game came out from the mainland to roam the ice pack there was always a chance of shooting something.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Foxes and rabbits, or Arctic hares were common. Occasionally an elk was seen, or a species of reindeer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seals were plenty, though rather difficult to hunt, and great flocks of ducks and geese at times flew over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The party were getting along amazingly well when one day a fearful, thrilling catastrophe occurred.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, none of the ship’s crew had ever penetrated further south, and knew nothing of the Antarctic continent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That it might be inhabited was possible, but there was no record.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the Arctic, Esquimaux lived contiguous to the Pole.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But in the Antarctic human life had never been found existent. Yet this was no evidence that it did not exist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One day Captain Hardy and Jack proposed to go on a seal hunt four miles away toward the open sea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They took two of the seamen—Jerry Mains and Adolph Sturgeson—with them. This left Second Mate Albert Stearns and six seamen aboard the craft.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, Lucille remained aboard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a fatal day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arrived at the sealing grounds the first catastrophe occurred. It was one never to be forgotten.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A seal was lanced by Sturgeson, very near the edge of the pack. The creature was killed, as the sailor believed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But as he ventured near it suddenly it turned and attacked him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before Sturgeson could get out of the way it had fastened one of its tusks through the calf of his leg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was held a prisoner, and the agony was so intense that he shrieked for aid. He was seen by all three of his companions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My God!” cried Jack Wallis, with the utmost horror. “Poor Sturgeson is done for!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t say that!” cried Captain Hardy, with anguish. “Save him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerry Mains was the nearest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seeing his companion in such deep trouble, he at once started for him. Out over the pack he ran.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The seal still hanging to his victim, was backing to the edge of the pack. A moment more and he would slide into the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mains reached the spot the next moment. With a blow he killed the seal and then grasped Sturgeson’s hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But at that moment a fearful thing happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The section of ice upon which they were suddenly snapped and broke away from the main pack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It drifted out into the black water. All might have been well even then had it not been for a phenomenon, almost always certain to occur.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were huge, top-heavy peaks on the ice floe, which caused it to become unbalanced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly it rocked violently, and then with a mighty vortex of waters keeled over and turned bottom side up, the heavy part of the berg sinking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An awful cry of horror escaped Captain Hardy and Jack Wallis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My God, they are lost forever!” cried the young mate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was certainly true.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two unfortunate men never rose. The bed of the deep Antarctic was their final resting place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no more seal hunting that day. The grief and horror of the two survivors can well be imagined.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing to do but to return to the Albatross and report the mishap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So back toward the ship they started. But as they came in sight of it, Captain Hardy remarked a peculiar circumstance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is queer!” he exclaimed. “There is no smoke from the galley pipes. What does it mean?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They cannot have let the fire go out!” cried Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two men exchanged startled glances. Without a word they pressed forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as they drew nearer the ice-bound ship no one came out to greet them. No one answered Jack’s hail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All was as silent as death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is the matter with them?” cried Captain Hardy. “Why on earth don’t they answer?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Forward they pushed rapidly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When twenty yards from the ship Jack Wallis paused with an awful cry of terror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Look!” he shrieked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There about the ship’s gangway the snow had been fearfully trampled and it was a crimson color. Blood was the cause of this.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And upon the sides of the ship, upon the ladder and the rail all was blood. Over the rail Jack Wallis went.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there upon the ship’s deck he saw the rigid figure of a man frightfully mutilated and frozen stiff in the bitter air.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1927/55355.html","bookId":881,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM"}
