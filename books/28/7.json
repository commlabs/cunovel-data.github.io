JUDITH’S HOUSE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Charles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. A cold, wet, and misty evening, and above all to one whose pockets are not lined! My foolish fancy for the Stage has brought me to a declining stage, if not a stage of decline. Heigh ho! how dark it is getting! Just the sort of place to meet with a[40] ghost of Hamlet, not the sort of hamlet that I’m looking after, for I have done with theatrical effects,—I wish that I had done with the effects of cold. How dark and gloomy that church steeple looks over the trees! I’m close to a churchyard, I suppose. And—ey! ey! what on earth are those white things upon the grass? Clothes put out to dry; what an ass I was not to see that before! but fasting makes one nervous. There’s a house. How cheerful the lights look in it! I hear the sound of a piano going. There must be ladies there, and ladies are ever good and kind. What if I were to try my fortune at the door? My poor namesake Prince Charlie must have put wanderers into fashion. Northumberland is near enough to Scotland to have imbibed a little of its spirit of romance. Poor Prince! we are fellows in misfortune as we were partners in ambition. We both sought to play the King, I on the boards, he in Britain; but his frea-king and my moc-king are both changed to aching on the moors, and a skul-king too, which makes us as thin as skeletons. I’ll try and muster up courage for a knock. [Knocks.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I should not look the worse for a new coat, I think. My knee-ribbons are bleached quite pale with the wind and the rain. Mais n’importe! the man, the man remains the same! These locks have proved the keys to a Lady’s heart e’er now; and then wit and eloquence! When I was flogged at school for affirming that a furbelow must be an article, as I knew it to be an article of dress, my Master observed that all my brains lay at the root of my tongue; and the best position for them too, say I! Who would keep a prompter to bellow to one from the top of the Monument, and where’s the use of carrying one’s brains so high, that one must send a carrier pigeon express for one’s thoughts before one can express them at all? Better have wit to cover ignorance, than silence to conceal sense. One can’t squint into a man’s head to see what it contains. Here comes a light to the door: now for the encounter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel opens the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is Mrs. [coughs] at home? Pray present my compliments to her, and say that a gentleman who has lost his way entreats the favour of shelter for a night under her hospitable roof.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Shall I take up your name, Sir?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. No, Sir, you may take up my words. [Exit Weasel.] Had the fellow been a Constable he might have taken me up also, for in this apparel I look more like a highwayman than a gentleman in a highway. How very cold it is! I wish that the triangular-nosed fellow would make haste; and yet my heart misgives me.[41] I must ‘screw my courage to the sticking point!’ Impudence, impudence is my passport! I hear him shuffling downstairs. Be hardy, bold, and resolute, my heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel opens the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Sir, my Mistress begs you to walk up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Go on, go on, I’ll follow thee! [Exeunt.]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE II.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE PARLOUR OF MRS. JUDITH’S HOUSE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Mrs. Judith. The Misses Sophia, Barbara, and Horatia Rattleton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. For all this unmerited kindness, most kind and fair ladies, a lonely wanderer can only return you thanks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [The young Ladies whisper together.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Handsome, isn’t he?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Such a flow of eloquence, such a command of language.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. I wonder, Ratty, who he is.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. Do you come from the North, Sir?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. I have spent the last few months there, Madam, though I was not born in Scotland. They were unfortunate months to me. I came to England on my Company’s being broken up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Your Company! did you serve King George?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. No, Miss, I tried to serve myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside to Barbara.] Strange, is it not?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Why was your company broken up?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Because we were not able to raise a Sovereign amongst us. We were sadly cut up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Eagerly.] By the Dragoons?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Laughing.] Do not inquire too closely, fair Lady.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. May I ask your name, Sir?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Charles Stu— [Aside.] Ass that I am!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. I beg your pardon, Sir, I did not hear you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] The first word that comes! [Aloud.] Dapple, Madam, Dapple. [Aside.] I might have hit on a more romantic name, but my brain seems in a whirl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. It is a very curious study to trace the derivations....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. Any way related to the Dapples of....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [42]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Down, Adonis, down! your dirty little paws....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. One would suppose them sometimes prophetical of future events. Who can deny that Hanover....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. Our family name of....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Raising her voice.] Who can deny that Hanover has a great resemblance to Hand-over, or that Cumberland is as just a denomination for the bloody Duke as if....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Pretty little pet he is, is he not?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. Our family name of Rattleton is said to be derived from a famous Ancestor of ours, a chief of the ancient Britons....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. My Cousin by the Mother’s side....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. Whose head being cleft from his shoulders as he was driving his chariot into the thickest of....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. The family of the Goslings....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Also passionately fond of Heraldry....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. His spirit seemed unconquered even by the blow which decapitated him, and he drove on....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. A Lion rampant over 6 grasshoppers....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. Whence our name of Rattle-ton or Rattle-on is said to be derived.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] This is beyond endurance. They stun me. What a nest of parrots I am in! I cannot get in a word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Thus, Sir, your name of ... I beg your pardon, Sir, it has slipped my memory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] Hang me, if it has not fairly bolted from mine!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. Mr. Charles Dapple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] I’ll change the conversation. [To Horatia.] You seem much devoted, Miss, to scientific pursuits.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. O, they are my delight, my recreation! Ornithology, Mythology, Geology, Conchology, fascinate me. I was first given my taste for the higher branches of these intellectual sciences by....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Mr. Dapple, have you remarked my pretty little....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. My Uncle in the Scilly Isles, whose mind....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Have you remarked....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. A profound genius....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. My little poodle, Adonis?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. By-the-by, Mr. Dapple, may I ask your opinion on a much disputed point, where I venture to differ even from my Uncle? What do you think of the Aerolites?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Turning to Sophia.] A sweet little dog, indeed: what fine eyes!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Do you think them....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [43]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The little pink ribbon round its neck is so becoming.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Raising her voice.] Mr. Dapple, Mr. Dapple, do you think the Aerolites....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] Help me, my mother-wits!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Do you agree in the generally received opinion....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] Some political party perhaps!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Or do you think them....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Why, ma’am, I think—I—I am decidedly of opinion—that—that—the....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. The Aerolites....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Are nothing more or less than Jacobites.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the Ladies. Jacobites!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Why, Sir, I always thought them a sort of stone....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Stone-fruit, true, true; I spoke without thinking. Stone-fruit, a species of—of—apricots.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. Hark, there is a knock at the door. Peep through the shutters, Ratty, and see who it is.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] A little diversion for me. I am growing so hot. Silence to cover sense would in this case....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. ’Tis old Colonel Stumply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Starting up.] Colonel Stumply! I’m dished.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Ladies. Why—what—who——\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Perhaps you will permit me, ladies, to retire. I feel indisposed—faint! [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. I must go and welcome my old friend. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Bab!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. Ratty!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. What a flash of electricity has burst on my intellect!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. His noble air; his wan features....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. A fugitive....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. A wanderer....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. His sudden alarm....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. [Rushing into her arms.] O Ratty, Ratty, what a day! what an honour! what a surprise!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. How now, what’s the matter?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Brain of adamant! could not instinct direct you to the feet of your adored Prince?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. The Prince! Is it possible?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Charlie! Charlie! O! what a moment!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Did you not hear him describe the ruin of his army....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Did you not hear ‘Charles Stew—’ upon his noble tongue....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [44]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. How he started when he recollected himself....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. And O, how exquisitely pathetic, how touchingly appropriate, the name he gave instead! Dapple; to signify how his fortunes are chequered—Dapple....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. How the Jacobites were running in his head when he even....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Little reason had he to fear us. If Daresby had been here....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. And this vile Colonel: no wonder he started off!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. What shall we do to get rid of him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. All that woman ever attempted I am ready to perform.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. I would die for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. And I too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. The handsome, brave, dear, darling young Prince! And to think that Daresby’s a Whig!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Mrs. Judith and Col. Stumply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Good evening, young Ladies, good evening. I have just returned from the North, where we are everywhere triumphant, and our laurels should ensure us a welcome from beauty. ‘None but the brave, none but the brave deserve the fair,’ you know. Hey, Miss Sophy?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. [Aside.] Monster!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside.] Traitor!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. [Aside.] Butcher!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. What, all silent and aghast? I shall begin to fear myself unwelcome. Hey, Mrs. Judith? But my Regiment is quartered for the night in the village, and I was sure that I might throw myself on the hospitality of an old friend.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. We are delighted to see you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Is your little room unoccupied to-night?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. To tell the truth there is a young....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside.] I could beat her! [Aloud.] It is quite unoccupied, Sir, except—except in this cold weather we keep the pigs there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. The pigs!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. Why, Ratty....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Oh, it is not fit to receive you, Sir. The chimney tumbled in during the last gale....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. Why, Ratty....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. And every pane of glass is broken.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. [Aside to Barbara.] O Bab, such lying can never thrive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [45]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. What strange non....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside.] How on earth can I stop her tongue? [Aloud.] Aunt, Aunt, is there any supper prepared for the Colonel?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Anything; anything; the cold ride has sharpened my appetite; but a good blaze like this cheers the heart, and gives me courage to face even the pigs, Miss Ratty!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. The pigs! why....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Would you like to see that everything is comfortable yourself, Aunt? [Aside.] I am in a fever!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Turn out the pigs, hey, Mrs. Judith?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. If I ever....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Go, dear Aunt, precious Aunt, do go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. A nice little dish of your own making would be so acceptable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. We’ll take care of the Colonel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jud. I cannot com—pre—hend—I—— [The girls half lead, half push her out.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. You will excuse me, young ladies; I always make a point of looking after my horse myself. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Sinking on a chair.] I am exhausted. Stupid sticks, why did you not assist me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. I tried, but....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. What shall we do now?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. My heart beats so, I shall expire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. The Colonel will stay in spite of the pigs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Where can we hide the Prince?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Starting up.] A thought has struck me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. What, what?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. You shall hear—it has been done before. You will aid me in the execution of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. [Throwing herself into her arms.] O my Ratty!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. We will save him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. We will, we will!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Or perish with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. We will.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Come, come, no time is to be lost; let us fly to his succour.\n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Come weal, come woe,\n\u003cbr\u003e We’ll gather and go,\n\u003cbr\u003e And live or die wi’ Charlie!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [46]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE III.\n\u003cbr\u003e A CHURCHYARD BY MOONLIGHT.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Charles, Sophia, Barbara, and Horatia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Where on earth are you taking me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. To safety, to safety.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. We know all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. You know all?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Your name, your situation....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Then you must know that the coming of the Colonel is hangably inconvenient to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. We tremble at your danger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. We will defend you with our lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Excessively kind, but it is not quite come to that yet. A kick or a caning....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. You make us shudder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. But I do not like promenading at this hour in winter! Is it a country fashion? I am very cold, and tired, and sleepy, and I would rather retire to rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Here then we have arrived at the spot. Descend, and you will find a bed prepared for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Descend! why, hang me if it isn’t a vault!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. If it would please you to descend....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Please me, you barbarous witches! would it please any one to be buried alive? What on earth do you mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. The only way to preserve your rights....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Rites, do you call these rites? They are very inhuman rites. Anything but the rites of hospitality. To offer a stranger the shelter of your roof, and then make his bed in a vault! This is your spare-room, is it? If I had guessed what you meant to do with your guest, I would not have troubled you with my company.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. O, for your Country’s sake....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. My Country’s sake! what good can it do my Country? I know your motives, you scientific Monster! you want to make a petrifaction of me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Is it possible that a treatment so....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. A treat meant is it? If you mean it for a treat, I assure you that I do not consider it as one. You may go in yourself and enjoy it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [47]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. So short a space ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. A very short space I can see, and a very narrow space too. I’ll be hanged if I get into it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Who could have expected opposition from such a quarter?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. Can the Hero shrink from so small a trial of his constancy? Oh, descend, descend, and we will admire....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Add mire, you cruel wretches! is there not enough at the bottom already?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. We would preserve you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Didn’t I say so? Some inhuman experiment! But I’ll not be preserved to please you, not I.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. [Throwing herself at his feet.] O noblest of men! doubt not our fidelity! yield to our agonized entreaties!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [The others kneel.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Yield, indeed! I beg you will rise, fair Ladies. I know not if you are jesting; ’tis but a cold jest to me. As for entering that vault, you may kill me before you bury me, for while I’m alive I’ll not go, Ladies; I say I will not go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Then we must leave him to his fate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Leave me, leave me, all alone in a churchyard. Ladies, ladies, for pity’s sake....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. I am beside myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Remain then beside me. Or rather, why cannot we return to the house? I am half frozen with cold and ... and excitement!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. You forget the Colonel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The Colonel. O, is that all? Can’t you hide me in some quiet corner?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. I have it! the storeroom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. But if a search should be made?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Search! who’ll search? The storeroom is the very place. Come, come, the air is piercing; come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara. This way; by the kitchen door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Once more into the house, dear friends, once more. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Is this the Prince? the Hero?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. O Ratty! our duty remains the same! [Exeunt.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [48]\n\u003cbr\u003e ACT II.\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE I.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE PARLOUR.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Colonel Stumply. Weasel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Good-morrow, Weasel. An old campaigner, you see, learns to be an early riser.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. I wish your honour a good morning. I hope you found your room comfortable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Most comfortable. No traces of the pigs, ha, ha! none the worse for the chimney-top; ha, ha, ha! That Comet has a tail, I guess. Well, Weasel, how has all gone on these two years, since I last found myself at Rattleton Hermitage? Hey?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Much the same as usual, your honour. Our only varieties are Dr. Daresby and the rheumatics; till last night when....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. The girls—the young Ladies seem much grown, much improved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. O, for the matter of that, yes, though Miss Ratty’s sadly taken up with the books, d’ye see. She’s poring all day long over a lot of different sorts of learnings; I don’t remember their names, but they all ends in oddity. Then she’s an out and out Jacobite, and thumps the piano when she sings ‘Charlie is my darling,’ as though she took it for a Whig. Indeed, your honour, last night....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. And Miss Barbara?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. She’s quiet like, Sir. She’s never off her chair stitching away. They says, your honour, that she makes holes on purpose to sew them up again, d’ye see?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Sophy—Miss Rattleton is a charming girl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Ah, so thinks some one else. Did your honour ever see young Dr. Daresby?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. No, what of him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. O, nothing, Sir. But they walks alone together, and sings duets together, and he gave her the little poodle, and they says, your honour, d’ye see....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Yes, yes, I understand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. She always feeds that fat little dog herself, your honour. She gives it slices of bread and strawberry jam. But she’s a good[49] young Lady, Sir. Often I sees her going to the cottages with her little pink bag filled with the good things which Mrs. Judith makes. (I knows that from Mrs. Marjory who has to wash out the grease-spots every day for Miss Sophy.) And there she goes mincing along with her long veil hanging behind, and her little poodle running on before her. But may I make bold to ask how Master Stumply is? He was a very little boy when....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Not a word of him, Weasel, not a word of him! He’s a wayward ... don’t speak of him! folly and indiscretion have been his bane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. [Shaking his head.] There’s some others I know seem running the same road.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. How? Who?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. O, it is not for me to say, your honour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Speak; explain yourself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. I dare say ’twas all a frolic, your honour, but there were odd doings here yesterday.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Tell me, tell me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. [Mysteriously.] Perhaps as an old friend of the Family your honour ought to know all, and such a rum affair....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Go on, go on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Well then, your honour, yesterday was a cold evening, d’ye see, and as I was stirring the kitchen fire there comes a knock, and I goes to the door, your honour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. There stands a tall, genteel-like lad with a ragged coat. And he would give me no name, but he said he was a Wanderer, and asked for a night’s lodging. So Mrs. Judith, who never can refuse any one, ordered the spare bed to be got ready for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. So I turned him out, hey, Weasel? There’s the secret of the pigs; but why this mystery?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Mystery, Sir, ay, that’s the word; but if your honour was to hear what followed!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. What? where did they put him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. [Lowering his voice.] When it was night, your honour, what sees I through the chink of the kitchen door in the passage but the three young Ladies lugging along a great bundle, and stopping and panting and puffing? So says I, I’ll see to the bottom of this, so I pops out suddenly and says, ‘Can I help you, Misses?’ quite civil like. But O Sir, how Miss Sophy trembled and turned as white as a lily, and Miss Ratty stamped and sent me to the village—at that[50] hour, your honour, company in the house—the ground covered with frost—I subject to the rheumatics—and what for, d’ye think? to get her twopenceworth of shoe-ribbon, your honour; and when I brought it, would you believe it?—she roared out that it was too narrow and sent me back again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Most strange! most unaccountable! Have you any guess what was in the bundle?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. I winked at it, your honour. There was a mattress and blankets, I’m sure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. For the Stranger, I suppose. But this mystery! I cannot understand it. Where could they be going?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. To the churchyard, I thinks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. The churchyard!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Why, your honour, they certainly did not go into the kitchen, and the back-door leads straight across the yard to the Church, and the vault would be no bad hiding-place, your honour. Miss Ratty has hid there herself, I knows, when the dentist was here.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Have you no other clue? What an extraordinary affair!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. Why, Sir—your honour, last night Mrs. Marjory overheard Miss Ratty whispering Miss Sophy, and she said, Sir....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. What? speak out!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weasel. ‘As long as the Colonel remains here the Prince must keep concealed.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. [Springing up.] The Prince! ha, ha! I smell a rat! the Pretender! the Pretender! if there was ever such luck, such fortune! Hang me if I could not—but there’s not an instant to be lost. Fly, Weasel, to the village. Bid Corporal Catchup and a dozen stout fellows be with me directly. Fly, I say, and if it be all as I hope, I’ll cram you with gold till you choke. Begone! Fly! [Exit Weasel.] Thirty thousand pounds and a baronetship! Sir Stephen Stumply! Ah, if that wayward boy—the Pretender! the Pretender! he’s in a net, in a net, and I’ll be hanged if I let him out of it. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE II.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE DRAWING-ROOM.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Horatia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. What a sleepless night I have passed, what anxiety, what excitement! and yet how unlike is he to what I had imagined! so timid, so petulant! and that perpetual punning! It matters not, however,—his title to our services remains the same! A strange misgiving[51] is on my soul; is it the shadow of approaching danger, or only the fear of it? The Colonel gave me a strange meaning look as he passed me this morning, and said, ‘You are early up, Miss Ratty; I fear that your rest was broken last night.’ Can he suspect anything? That sneaking wretch, Weasel! Hark, I hear the Colonel’s step and a strange voice. I’ll conceal myself behind this screen. Perhaps....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Colonel Stumply and Corporal Catchup.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Plant two stout fellows at the front door, and half a dozen in the garden. Place them so that there shall be no possibility of escape either from the house or the churchyard adjoining.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cor. I will, Sir.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside.] Horror and despair!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Yourself and four of your best men go and search the open vault at the right-hand corner of the churchyard, and on your lives let not your prisoner escape. Go, plant your Sentinels, and then to your business. [Exit Corporal Catchup.] I will go and superintend myself. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Day of horror and misery! All is lost. All is discovered. If I but knew of one who could divert the attention of these wretches till the Prince escaped! If I ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Daresby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby! He’s a Whig! but I’ll make him my tool.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Good morning, I came thus early....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Speaking very fast.] You are so welcome—you came just a moment ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. My Sophy! nothing is the matter with her?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. O no. It’s a poor soldier—got the cholera—lying in the vault ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. In a vault!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Run, run, dearest Daresby, or you will be too late.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. What do you mean? Explain yourself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. The cholera, I say—in the vault—O! you put me in a fever. For my sake, for Sophy’s—O run, fly!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Whatever can you ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Go, or I shall run wild! You know the way, go!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. If I can be of any use to the poor sufferer. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. O, what a relief! he’s gone! I should never survive another day of such excitement. If they once suppose that their object is gained and the Prince caught, the sentinels will be removed[52] from the garden, and he can escape through the window. If the deception can be carried on for one half-hour he may be saved. I must go and put my sisters on their guard, and prepare the Prince for flight. If Aunt Judith or Weasel see and recognise Daresby all is lost. I wish I could lock them both up. What a labyrinth I am in! The greatest comfort is that the Colonel is a blockhead, and would not know a prince from a pancake! [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE III.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE STORE-ROOM.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Something better than a vault this, methinks. I could not have found a hiding-place more to my mind. Excellent cherry-brandy she makes, this Mrs. Judith. I have entered half a dozen professions since I entered this room; it will be hard if I do not make my fortune out of one of them. I am an Historian, for I have been discussing old dates; a Merchant, for I add plum to plum; a Lawyer, for I have opened many a case; a Lord Mayor, for the mace is before me; and a Navigator, for I am led to seize and gulf! What if I were to stay here altogether, or set up a new company with my fair hostesses? Miss Ratty is cut out for a tragedy Queen. Such passion! such emphasis! [Mimicking.] ‘That my keen knife see not the wound it makes’—but the puzzle is that they are all ladies; not one to take a gentleman’s part. It is a shame in me to say so, for I am sure that they have taken mine. My only hope would be in Weasel. That fellow has such a desperate squint, that I am sure he would make a capital Lear!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Horatia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Fly! fly! while yet there is a moment’s respite.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Fly! and wherefore?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Rouse all the ancient courage of your race ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. There can be no courage in a race, for a race is running away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Let the spirit of your Ancestors glow in your bosom, for the hour of danger is come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. ‘I dare do all that may become a man’ ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Does this trifling become a man and a hero?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. I know of but one thing, fair Ratty, that can become a man and a hero.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. What is that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. A boy, to be sure!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Enough, enough of this perpetual play of words. We[53] must think, we must act. Another is now taking your place at the vault ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. My place! how excessively obliging!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Every moment is invaluable. Put on this dress of my Aunt’s which I have brought for you, and fly, fly, while the deception lasts!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The brandy must have got into my head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Put it on, I entreat you, if not for your own or your Country’s sake, yet for your noble Father’s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. My Father’s! Either you or I ... Why, what’s the matter with him? Is he in the farce too?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside.] He is the worse for liquor! O horrible! and at such a moment! [Aloud.] The soldiers are here—sent to seize you—to drag you to a dungeon, perhaps an ignominious death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Alarmed.] And why? what have I done?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. I heard the orders given. One hour’s delay will lead you to the scaffold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The scaffold!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. The block.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The block! why, what is my crime? Why does not my Father come to my assistance?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Your Father cannot—he is exiled from his native land. Were he to appear, he must perish too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Have you hid him? have you hid him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. [Aside.] Horridly drunk! [Aloud.] Put on this dress and fly. It is your only chance of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. You have put me into a shiver. I cannot half believe, nor a quarter comprehend you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Believe then these tears, this agony of apprehension in which you see me. This moment the soldiers may be mounting the staircase—cutting off all hope ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Give me the slip then, and I will give them the slip! quick, quick, and the cloak and hood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Here, here! O despatch! while you remain here I tread on hot iron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. I am to personate your Aunt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Yes, yes, any one, but make haste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. So, I’m equipped. Farewell, Lady!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Pull the hood over your face. O farewell! [Exit Charles.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. One hour more of excitement, and then ... [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [54]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE IV.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE CHURCHYARD.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Corporal Catchup and Soldiers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Silence! Silence! halt! advance bending down and with your bayonets presented. Comrades, this is a glorious day, and if we catch the Pretender we shall have little cause to grieve that we arrived a day too late for the Battle of Culloden. What were the deeds of the Duke of Cumberland to ours? He but wounded the fox, we catch him by the nose. We shall be made Aldermen, every man of us. Take ground behind those bushes; keep silence. I hear a voice in the vault. On your lives be silent—be steady!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. [In the vault.] I can find no one, yet here is a bed prepared. What a strange place to make an hospital of! [Emerging from the vault.] Perhaps the poor fellow has got frightened and delirious ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Stand!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Ah, here is my Patient. So you have got the cholera, my Friend!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. No, unless that’s one of your titles. Surrender or die!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. He must be in a high fever! Be calm, my good man, I will render you all the assistance in my power.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. You will, will you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Come with me to the house, come. This is no place for a person in your state.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Well, if this arn’t droll! he’s trying to humbug me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. You may catch your death of cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. I’ll catch nothing but you. Come along, Sir, offer no resistance, for it’s of no use. I’m sorry for you, but I’ve a duty to perform, and a reward to get.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. What do you mean, fellow? Stand off!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Ho! guards there! [Daresby is surrounded.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. This is some error. By whose warrant do you dare to apprehend one of his Majesty’s subjects?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. No use in all that deception, Sir: all’s discovered now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. What’s discovered, fellow, what deception? Who dares use such terms to me! You shall answer for your conduct, Sir; this shall not be passed over, I’ll warrant you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. I hope not, Sir.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [55]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. This is not to be endured. By whose orders do you presume to place me under arrest?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. We are under the orders of Colonel Stumply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. I must see the Colonel instantly. He shall give me an explanation of this extraordinary affair. Take me to him directly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. All in good time, Sir. Stickum, have you handcuffs with you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Handcuffs, villain!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stickum. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Keep your hand on his collar, then. Soldiers, present bayonets. Let him attempt to escape, and he dies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. With what effrontery ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Move on, Sir, if you please. [To the Soldiers.] Keep your eye on him. If he but raise his hand or turn his head—fire! [Exeunt.]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE V.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE GARDEN GATE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shannon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. A could, misty, morning, and I am left here to keep watch without a drop of the cratur to cheer my heart or keep my spirits from sinking. There’s all the rest of them gone to catch the Pretender and get the prize-money, and it’s nothing that I’m likely to catch here but a cold. I wish that I had never left the tallow business, that I do, for all this murthering work. It was a lucky chance that we were a day too late for the fair at Culloden; it’s no fancy I have for the Highlanders’ dirks. Awful slashing work they made, ’tis said. Well-a-day! I must shoulder my gun; if the Corporal found me standing at ease, he would order me a round dozen: there’s no fear of it’s going off for its own accord, the cratur, for I forgot to load it this morning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Charles in disguise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] And there is a Sentry! Horatia was right! But what they should want to arrest either me or my Father for is more than I can comprehend! This is really nervous work. I fear that I shall find it as difficult to pass this fellow as I found it at school to parse a sentence from my grammar-book. Notwithstanding the dress with which Ratty provided me, I shall need all the[56] address of which I am master to get through this scrape should he address me. I must put on an air of confidence. Perhaps he may let me pass without question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. A black morning, Ma’am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Attempting to slip past.] Did you ever see mourning any other colour?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Can’t pass here, Ma’am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. No! and why?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. ‘Cause I am posted here to keep a good watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Attempting to pass again.] Easier to keep a good watch than to get one!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. I have orders to let no one pass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. O but, my good fellow, I have very important business. You must let me go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Keep back, Ma’am. Now I thinks on’t, your hood looks rather suspicious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Retreating a step.] Does it? A sort of robbin’ hood, I suppose. [Aside.] I wish the fellow were at Jericho.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. And that dress was never made for you? Let me see a little closer. [Advancing.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Retreating. Aside.] Shall I run for my life?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Stop, stop, my good Lady! Methinks your dress is uncommon short, too, it hardly reaches to the clocks of your stockings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Mind your watch, and leave my clocks alone. [Aside.] O dear! O dear! If I were but once fairly off! [Attempts to run.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Stop, or I’ll shoot ye! I’ll send a bullet through your head if ye stir an inch farther.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] I’m done for!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. [Aside.] I’ll make sure. [Suddenly darts towards Charles and pulls back his hood.] Hillo! hillo! I’ve caught him! I’ve caught him, ’tis the man himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] One struggle for life. [Aloud.] Beware, fellow, I have arms. [Aside.] None but what nature gave me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. [Retreating a step. Aside.] Murther! and the gun is not loaded!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] I’ve staggered him! [Aloud.] Lay but a finger on me and I’ll lay you with the dust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Keep off, or I’ll shoot ye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Retreating.] A fig for your gun!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. [Aside. Retreating.] I wish some one would come. I’ve heard he’s a raal hero. I’ll call for help. Holloa! there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Hold your peace, or I’ll cut you piece-meal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. I’ll blow your brains out, I will! [Aside.] He can’t guess that it’s not loaded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] If he should fire!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. [Aside.] If he should fight! My poor Mother; och, if she could see me now, ’twould pit her into high-strikes. Is no one coming to help me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. [Aside.] If I could but touch his kinder feelings! I have been accustomed to steal hearts, but I fear that I should find his steeled already. I must make one more effort to steal past him. But the sight of his matchlock makes my blood run cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Och! he’s coming nearer. O for pity’s sake ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. If mercy ever touched your bosom ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Corporal Catchup.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Catch him! catch him! ’tis he, the Pretender! catch him, Corporal! collar him! never fear!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. Who? the old woman?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Catch him, I say, and never be frightened for him, man. I found him out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. So—all is lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. A man in disguise! it must be he. Bind him, O’Shannon. This is a prize indeed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Ah, poor gintleman, your troubles will soon be pit an end to. Ah! ye may well sigh, for no man laughs on his way to the gallows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The gallows! is it possible that so inhuman a murder can be contemplated?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. O ye may be satisfied of it! There’s only one thing that’s doubtful, I’m thinking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. What’s that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Whether they’ll stick your head on the Lord Mayor’s mace before or after they’ve hung you!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. O horrible, horrible, most horrible! It cannot, O it cannot be! What a dreadful, what a fearful fate! O that the first step I took from my Father’s home had been into a horse-pond! that I had died e’er I left it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Ay, there’s the pity! Had ye stayed peaceably at home, this would never have happened to ye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [58]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. The gallows! can it be?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Ah, how all the Ladies will pity ye! such a likely lad, and so young, and ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. Silence! you distract me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O’Shan. Poor gintleman! when it comes to the pinch, when the rope ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corp. No more, O’Shannon! You have secured his arms. Bring him speedily along with you. No delay!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. My limbs can scarcely support me! O day of agony, of misery, and despair! [Exeunt.]\n\u003cbr\u003e SCENE VI.\n\u003cbr\u003e THE PARLOUR.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Colonel Stumply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. [Rubbing his hands.] Caught! caught!

The Pretender is in safe hands now. Who would have thought you up to such a conspiracy?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Alas, our unhappy Prince!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. [Aside to Horatia.] Poor Daresby! It makes my heart faint to think of him. I cannot stay to look on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. You must stay to keep him silent. ’Tis but for an hour. I am ashamed of you. Remember that you have a part to perform.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophy. I cannot say what is not true.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Say nothing, then.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Daresby guarded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby.

[Horatia makes earnest signs to him to be silent.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. You shall be treated, Sir, with all the respect due to your station, consistent with your safe custody.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Of what am I charged? Who is my accuser? what wretch dares? [Horatia repeats the signs.] What is the meaning of all this nonsense? Do you wish to make a fool of me? I’ll not endure this ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Be calm, Sir, and submit to destiny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. I’ll not submit to such treatment.

If I might make bold to ask why....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Begone this instant ... we shall want poultry.

Sophy, Sophy, if you are still the ingenuous being I ever believed you to be, tell me in what farce I am thus forced to act a part against my will. Tell me the secret of the conspiracy which seems formed against me. Are you an accessory?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Why, the Ladies have been turning every stone in your defence! They never let out the secret! As far as they were concerned you might have remained in your vault until you were old enough to stay there altogether!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby.

My dear Father, I have used no deception except that of changing my name. I am the deceived, not the deceiver. No one present is as much surprised at seeing me, as I myself am at finding myself thus. These fair Ladies kindly and willingly took me[61] in, and I see that, quite unwittingly, I have taken them in also! I own that I merit your displeasure, but I will do so no longer. I have received a lesson which I will not soon forget. I will no longer run counter to your wishes, but return to the counter for which you destined me. I have long devoted myself to a-muse, but now I will learn to obey. I own that I too fondly sought the giddy cheer of an applauding audience. Romance and her knights had taken possession of my fancy, but I have found the nights too cold, and the cheer too indifferent. I return with humble regret to my loving Sire, and if he will receive me a-gain, he may perhaps be able to make a-gain of me yet!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Col. Ah, you Rogue, you little merit that I should look at you again. The Pretender, indeed! so farewell to my dreams of fortune! I always thought it too good to be true. Ladies, I have to beg a thousand pardons for my rudeness in breaking in....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. I must bear that blame, my Father. Had I not broken out, you would not have broken in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Horatia. Deceiving Wretch! could I for a moment....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. No anger, fair Miss Ratty, we had enough of this indignation at the brink of the vault, when you were near falling out with me because I would not fall in with your ideas, and fall into the vault.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. Ah, Sophy, how you treated me!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophia. I thought it my duty, dearest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daresby. I can pardon you anything; but that deceiving Ratty, whose word I can never again believe....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charles. No more of that, Daresby. The farce is ended, the mists of mistake are clearing up, the reign of Folly must fall, let not Anger survive its cause!\n\u003cbr\u003e Now that we have ended all this War of Words,\n\u003cbr\u003e And fall to drawing corks instead of swords,\n\u003cbr\u003e Now the Pretender may his Captors mock,\n\u003cbr\u003e And view with glee a match without the lock,\n\u003cbr\u003e Let each resentful thought and feeling cease,\n\u003cbr\u003e And General Harmony conclude the Piece!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1740/50948.html","bookId":28,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:34:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:34:49 AM"}
