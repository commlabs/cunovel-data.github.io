{"id":40402,"no":23,"title":"FIRESTORM","content":"At first there was a sound like a roaring wind in herdreams.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then a tearing noise filled the air, the crackle of drybrush inflamed, and the smell of smoke swept over Tally,bringing her suddenly and completely awake.\n\u003cbr\u003e Billowing clouds of smoke surrounded her, blotting outthe sky. A ragged wall of flame moved through the flowers,giving off a wave of blistering heat. She grabbed her knapsackand stumbled down the hill away from the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally had no idea in which direction the river lay.\n\u003cbr\u003e Nothing was visible through the dense clouds. Her lungsfought for air in the foul brown smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then she spotted a few rays from the setting sunbreaching the billows, and she oriented herself. The riverwas back toward the flame, on the other side of the hill.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally retraced her path to the top of the hill and peereddown through the smoke. The fire was growing stronger.\n\u003cbr\u003e Fingers of it shot up the hill, leaping from one beautifulflower to another, leaving them scorched and black. Tallycaught the glimmer of the river through the smoke, but theheat pushed her back.\n\u003cbr\u003e She stumbled down the other side again, coughing andspitting, one thought in her mind: Was her hoverboardalready engulfed in flames?\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally had to get to the river. The water was the onlyplace safe from the rampaging fire. If she couldn’t go overthe hill, maybe she could go around.\n\u003cbr\u003e She descended the slope at full tilt. There were a fewspots burning on this side, but nothing like the gallopingflame behind her. She reached level ground and made herway around the base of the hill, crouching low to theground to duck under the smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e Halfway around, she reached a blackened patch wherethe fire had already passed. The brittle stems of flowerscrunched under her shoes, and the heat coming off thescorched earth stung her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her footsteps ignited with flame as she ran through theblackened flowers, like stabbing a poker into a slumberingfire. She felt her eyes drying, her face blistering.\n\u003cbr\u003e Moments later, Tally spotted the river. The firestretched in an unbroken wall across the opposite shore, aroaring wind pressing at its back and sending embers flyingacross to alight on the near side. A rolling billow of smokesurged toward her, choking and blinding her until itpassed.\n\u003cbr\u003e When her eyes could open again, Tally spotted theUGLIES 173shiny solar surface of her hoverboard. She ran toward it,ignoring the burning flowers in her path.\n\u003cbr\u003e The board seemed untouched by the flame, protected bygood luck and the layer of dew it collected every nightfall.\n\u003cbr\u003e She quickly folded the board and stepped onto it, notwaiting for the yellow light to turn green. The heat hadmostly dried it already, and it rose into the air at her command.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally took the board over the river, just above thewater, and skimmed her way upstream, looking for a breakin the wall of fire to her left.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her grippy shoes were ruined, their soles cracked likesunbaked mud, so she flew slowly, scooping up handfuls ofwater to soothe her burning face and arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e A noise thundered to life on Tally’s left, unmistakableeven above the roar of the fire. She and the board werecaught in a sudden wind, shoved back toward the othershore. Tally leaned hard against it and stuck a foot into thewater to slow the board. She clung tightly with both hands,desperately fighting being thrown into the river.\n\u003cbr\u003e The smoke suddenly cleared, and a familiar shapeloomed out of the darkness. It was the flying machine, itsthundering beat now obvious above the raging fire. Sparksjumped across the river as the machine’s windstorm stirredthe fire to a new intensity.\n\u003cbr\u003e What were they doing? she wondered. Didn’t they realizethey were spreading the fire?\n\u003cbr\u003e Her question was answered a moment later when a174 Scott Westerfeldgout of flame shot from the machine, squirting across theriver to ignite another patch of flowers.\n\u003cbr\u003e They had set the fire, and were driving it on in everyway they could.\n\u003cbr\u003e The flying machine thundered closer, and she glimpsedan inhuman face staring at her from the pilot seat. Sheturned her board to fly away, but the machine lifted up intothe air, passing right over her, and suddenly the wind wastoo great.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally pitched off and into the water. Her crash braceletscaught for a moment, holding her up above the waves, butthen the wind caught the hoverboard, much lighter withouther on it, and spun it away like a leaf.\n\u003cbr\u003e She sank into the deep water in the middle of the river,knapsack and all.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was cool and quiet under the waves.\n\u003cbr\u003e For a few endless moments, Tally felt only relief to haveescaped the searing wind, the thundering machine, the blisteringheat of the firestorm. But the weight of the crashbracelets and knapsack pulled her down fast, and panicwelled up in her pounding chest.\n\u003cbr\u003e She thrashed in the water, climbing up toward theflickering lights of the surface. Her wet clothes and geardragged at her, but just as her lungs were about to burst,she broke the surface into the maelstrom. Tally gulped afew breaths of smoky air, then was slapped in the faceUGLIES 175by a wave. She coughed and sputtered, struggling to stayafloat.\n\u003cbr\u003e A shadow passed over her, blacking out the sky. Thenher hand struck something—a familiar grippy surface. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e Her hoverboard had come back to her! Just the way italways did when she spilled. The crash bracelets lifted herup until she could grab on to it, her fingers clinging to itsknobbly surface as she gasped for air.\n\u003cbr\u003e A high-pitched whine came from the nearby shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally blinked away water from her eyes and saw that theRusty machine had landed. Figures were jumping from themachine, spraying white foam at the ground as theycrashed through the burning flowers and into the river.\n\u003cbr\u003e They were headed for her.\n\u003cbr\u003e She struggled to climb onto the board.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait!” the nearest figured called.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally rose shakily to her feet, trying to keep steady onthe wet surface of the board. Her hard-baked shoes wereslippery, and her sodden knapsack seemed to weigh a ton.\n\u003cbr\u003e As she leaned forward, a gloved hand reached up to grabthe front of the board. A face came up from the water, wearingsome sort of mask. Huge eyes stared up at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e She stomped at the hand, crunching the fingers. Theyslipped off, but her weight was thrown too far forward, andthe board tipped its nose into the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally tumbled into the river again.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hands grabbed at her, pulling her away from the hover-176 Scott Westerfeldboard. She was hoisted out of the water and onto a broadshoulder. She caught glimpses of masked faces: huge, inhumaneyes staring at her unblinkingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bug eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1847/53555.html","bookId":974,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM"}
