There are so many arrangements to make, the gowns to be chosen, endless fittings-and the dressmakers take forever. The invitations must be prepared, sent out, and acknowledged-\" She paused. \"About how many guests will there be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five or six hundred, I imagine,\" Clayton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closer to a thousand unless you want to offend half the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eton and alienate our relatives,\" Stephen corrected, grinning at Whitney\u0027s expression of stunned honor. Taking pity on her, he added, \"Westmoreland dukes are always married in a church, and the wedding celebration is always here at Claymore. It\u0027s an ancient tradition, and everyone will know it, so you needn\u0027t worry about anyone thinking it queer that it\u0027s at Clay\u0027s home instead of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always married in a church, and the celebration here?\" Whitney repeated, with an accusing look at her grinning fiance. \"When I think of how you threatened to abduct me and take me to Scotland!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The custom, Madam,\" Clayton chuckled, tracing the elegant curve of her cheek and jaw with his forefinger, then tilting her chin up, \"began because the first Duke of Claymore abducted his lady from her parents\u0027 castle, which was several days journey from Claymore. On the way here was a monastery, and since my ancestor had technically compromised her honor, one of the monks was more than willing to marry them, despite the lady\u0027s temporary reluctance. The celebration,\" he emphasized, \"took place here because the young woman\u0027s outraged relatives were in no mood to celebrate in their home an occasion which, at the time, they viewed as more a reason to fight than to feast.\" His grin widened devilishly. \"So you see, had I carried you off to Scotland, married you there, then brought you back here, I\u0027d have been honoring the tradition almost to the original letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving been silenced on that subject, Whitney returned to the length of time required to prepare for the wedding. \"Therese DuVille\u0027s wedding was not even half so large, and it took a year to accomplish . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Clayton said irrevocably. \"Absolutely not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six months?\" Whitney offered to compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six weeks,\" Clayton announced flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis imperious tone didn\u0027t daunt Whitney in the least. \"If it\u0027s to be such a large wedding, it could scarcely be planned even in six months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton winked conspiratorially at Stephen. \"Very well,\" he sighed, \"I\u0027ll give you eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight months,\" Whitney agreed with a sad little sigh. \"It will barely be time enough, yet it seems like forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight weeks,\" her fiance corrected with finality. \"Not one day more. My mother will help you and so will Hudgins. I\u0027ll put an entire staff of assistants at your disposal. Eight weeks will give you plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney shot him a dubious look, but since she didn\u0027t want to wait eight months either, she happily agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton was sitting with his arm around Whitney\u0027s shoulders, chatting amiably with Stephen, when the weight against his side suddenly grew heavier and she didn\u0027t respond to his teasing remark. He glanced down and saw her long lashes lying softly against her cheeks. \"She\u0027s asleep,\" he said quietly. Gently, he moved her aside, then scooped her up into his arms. \"It\u0027s been a more than exhausting day for you, sweetheart,\" he murmured as she stirred and snuggled into his chest. To Stephen he said, \"Wait for me here. I have some things I want to say to you when I come down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, after summoning a maid and seeing Whitney sleepily installed in one of the guest rooms, Clayton strode back into the salon and firmly closed the doors behind him. When he turned around, Stephen thrust a glass of brandy into his hand and raised his own in a silent toast. \"I have two questions to ask you,\" Clayton said calmly when they were both seated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Stephen stretched his long legs out in front of him and crossed them at the ankles. \"I rather thought you might, your grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know who Whitney was? To me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me. During a very drunken night at Grand Oak, you told me all about her, including her green eyes-which, God knows, she has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, Clayton rested his forearms on his knees, staring into his brandy glass as he rolled it between his palms. \"How much did I tell you that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen considered lying because it was kinder, but he abandoned the idea when Clayton\u0027s disconcertingly perceptive gaze lifted to his. \"Everything,\" Stephen admitted with a sigh. \"Everything including the harm you did her. So, when she appeared here tonight, thinking you\u0027d received her note-which I understand Hudgins has-I took one look at her and decided that since her loss had done such damage to you, I would restore her to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton nodded his acceptance of Stephen\u0027s explanation. \"I have one further question,\" he said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you had two questions, and you\u0027ve already reached your limit,\" Stephen warned lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring that, Clayton said in a low, solemn voice, \"I would like to know what I have within my power to give you, to express my gratitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your money, or your life?\" Stephen ventured with a lopsided grin at his bandit\u0027s demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re yours for the asking,\" Clayton said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, he lay on his bed, his hands linked behind his head, staring at the ceiling. He could hardly believe that Whitney was here, that after fighting against him so fiercely, for so long, she had come tonight and fought to recover what they had begun together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the way she had faced him in the study, daring him to deny that he still wanted her. And then he smiled in the darkness, remembering the way she had crossed the long room to him, her head held high, her eyes shining with love and surrender. That memory, that one memory of her coming to him, casting aside her pride because she loved him, would endure in his heart for as long as he lived. Nothing would ever mean more to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow he would insist on a complete explanation for what had happened to change her attitude so drastically between the wedding and the banquet. No, he corrected himself with a wry grin, he would ask her for an explanation -that tempestuous beauty sleeping across the hall would be for more likely to respond to a question than a demand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/whitney-my-love-westmoreland-saga-2/page-119.html","bookId":1804,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:29 PM"}
