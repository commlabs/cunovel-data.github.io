HOW LYMAN SUCCEEDED.","content":"\"I am afraid you misjudge me, Uncle Anthony,\" said Lyman, after a pause, during which he reflected that his best course was, if possible, to make a favorable impression upon the relative who might be in possession of considerable property. \"I am afraid that you are prejudiced against me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must admit that I have reason,\" said his uncle, dryly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is true,\" replied Lyman, with an engaging frankness; \"I did not treat you well in California.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should say not. You disappeared, carrying away two thousand dollars, leaving me penniless.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course I was wrong. Still you had the claim, out of which you made a good deal more within a short time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When you left me,\" said the hermit, quietly, \"it looked as if it were worthless. That it proved otherwise, was my good fortune.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t argue the matter, Uncle Anthony. I was young and heedless.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wicked would be a better word.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I have had bad luck; I am almost penniless now. If you would be willing to help me——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To what extent do you want help?\" asked Anthony, abruptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you could lend me fifty dollars, it would set me on my feet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And in a week or two you would be coming back for more.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Upon my honor——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How much honor have you?\" asked his uncle, contemptuously. \"Would you like to go West?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I will give you the means of getting there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman was under the impression that his uncle proposed to hand him a sum of money, out of which he decided to buy a western ticket if it suited his convenience; Uncle Anthony would be none the wiser.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, uncle, if you will give me a hundred dollars, I will go to Chicago, and seek there a chance to make an honest livelihood.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Anthony took out a memorandum book, tore a leaf from it, and wrote a few lines, which he handed to his nephew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is this?\" asked Lyman, suspiciously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is an order on a friend of mine in New York for a Chicago railroad ticket.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And the money?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He will give you an order on a firm in Chicago for the balance of the money, which will be paid you there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman\u0027s countenance fell. It was clear that the trick which he intended to play on his uncle would be impossible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"it would be better to give me the money at once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you have no suspicions of my good faith.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t express my opinion on that subject. I will only say that the arrangement I have suggested suits me best.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" said Lyman, slowly, \"I will try to win your good opinion. I am afraid I have not money enough to get back to the city.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had over ten dollars in his pocket at that moment, but it struck him that he had a good excuse for securing a little more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hermit smiled contemptuously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then suppose I had had no money to give you—how would you have got back to the city? Perhaps you meant to stay with me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will, Uncle Anthony, if you desire it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you. I won\u0027t trouble you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should have had to walk back. But, uncle, I can\u0027t leave you without a word of warning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That boy, Mark, I am sure is scheming to rob you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you know of Mark?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know the reputation he bears in the town. I know he has been discharged from the shoe-shop.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who told you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Two boys whom I met. One is the son of Mark\u0027s employer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know the boys you mean. They dislike Mark, but I prefer him to them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A noise was heard at the door, and Mark entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked in surprise at the visitor, whom he instantly recognized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You see, Mark,\" said the hermit, \"my nephew has kindly called to see me again. He felt anxious about my health.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I feel relieved to find you so much better, uncle,\" said Lyman, by no means abashed at the hermit\u0027s ironical words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is the more creditable to him, this solicitude, because he had only money enough to pay his fare one way. Mark, you may give him five dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, sir,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark drew a five-dollar gold piece from his pocket, and handed it to Lyman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Does Mark carry all your money, uncle?\" asked Lyman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not quite all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope he won\u0027t take a fancy to travel at your expense.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark\u0027s face flushed indignantly, but he left old Anthony to answer for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have perfect confidence in Mark,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir,\" Mark responded, gratefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you anything for me to do this morning?\" the boy asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; I will give you a list of articles which you may bring me from the village to-morrow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I will return, as I have some work to do at home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will go along with you, Mark,\" said Lyman, suddenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you wish,\" answered Mark, but he would rather have gone alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-by, Uncle Anthony. It may be a good while before I see you again. If you need me at any time, write or telegraph.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will bear it in mind,\" said the old man, dryly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark and the dutiful nephew left the cabin together.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve got a soft place, youngster,\" Lyman began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have an easy place, and a kind employer,\" said Mark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you carry the old man\u0027s money, hey?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some of it,\" answered Mark, eying his companion, suspiciously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t looked scared, boy. I\u0027m not going to rob you. I only want to ask you a few questions. How much money did you and he take from that buried jar the other day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who told you about it?\" asked Mark, in surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"O, I know more about the old man\u0027s affairs than you suppose,\" chuckled Lyman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t tell you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Won\u0027t, you mean,\" returned Lyman, scowling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no right to do so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look here, boy, do you know that I am my uncle\u0027s heir?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He never told me so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I tell you so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hear you, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll tell you something else. I believe you are trying to worm yourself into my uncle\u0027s confidence, so as to rob him—and me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your thinking so doesn\u0027t make it so,\" said Mark, angrily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I warn you that you had better think twice before you play such a dangerous game. You have a bad reputation in the village.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who told you so?\" demanded Mark, indignantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Two of your companions.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"James Collins and Tom Wyman probably!\" said Mark, contemptuously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know you were discharged from your place in the shoe-shop.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But for no good reason.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s what you say.

In that case, the order which he carried would not be honored, and he would probably lose more than he would gain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark was apprehensive of an attack, and it was with joy that he caught sight a little way in advance of James and Tom, whom under other circumstances he would not have cared to meet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will now have company,\" he said, \"and I will hurry along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman did not oppose his purpose, and joined the two boys.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53042.html","bookId":1019,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM"}
