The knowledge was maddening. \"I assure you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emarriage is the very last thing on my mind at the moment. And I would certainly have little interest in forming an alliance with a Shield, of all people. Why, Gryph isn\u0027t even of the same social class as myself. We have absolutely nothing in common. The whole notion is quite out of the question.\" Sariana knew her own clan would be shocked at the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Avylyn brightened, obviously relieved. \"Just as well. Just as well. Shield marriages are, well, never mind. It\u0027s difficult to explain and I\u0027m not sure anybody except a Shield and his mate really understand the relationship, anyway. It\u0027s just that since you weren\u0027t raised here, you don\u0027t know much about Shields and I felt it my duty to warn you thatâ€¦ Never mind. No warnings are necessary as long as you are quite certain that both of you are only interested in having a fling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you a secret, madam. I don\u0027t know what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then my advice is to throw yourself into an affair.\" Lady Avylyn tapped Sariana\u0027s wrist with her folded fan. \"Indulge yourself in some fun, my dear. It would do you a great deal of good, I\u0027m sure. See you at the buffet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Avylyn swung around in a whirl of golden skirts and sailed out of the alcove. Sariana stared after her. Lady Avylyn was right. The only sort of relationship Sariana could possibly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave with Gryph was an affair, and she had been toying with the mildly scandalous, wholly fascinating idea since the night he had found her in the conservatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were different in the western provinces. One could be a bit reckless and daring and no one would think twice about it. One could even have an affair that crossed class lines and the most anyone would do was smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past three days Sariana had been mulling the matter over. She had deliberately evaded Gryph while she tried to sort out her own confused feelings on the subject. In the end, she had sat down at her desk and resorted to the management tool of composing a neat little matrix of positives and negatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the positive side, she was unmarried and she was old enough to conduct an affair. She was wise enough to handle it discreetly, which would have been the main requirement back home. She wasn\u0027t sure discretion was terribly important here in the western provinces unless one or both members of the couple were married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was, she probably wouldn\u0027t have to worry all that much about discretion. She had written that fact into the decision matrix, too. It seemed important. She was an ocean away from her homeland where such things were valued and she was unlikely to ever see anyone here again if she managed to return east next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso on the positive side had been a reluctant admission that she was attracted to Glyph Chassyn in a way she had never known with any other man. She was uncertain about the wisdom of satisfying the compelling curiosity that was growing within her. Yet she thought that, on the whole, it might be better to test its depths. It was always better to confront the unknown and deal with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had added that sensible note to the positive side of the matrix, too. The longer she sat at her desk, the longer the list of positives got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the negative side of the matrix had contained only one entry; a worrisome note reminding herself that she really had nothing in common with a Shield. The only thing be could possibly want from her was a sexual liaison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she told herself now as she watched the couples circle the glittering ballroom, a sexual liaison was all she was looking for too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething seemed to be missing in the equation, however. She was afraid to ask what that something might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana sipped her punch and wished desperately she knew more about sex and men in general. She had the vague but disturbing sensation that she was standing on the brink of a very sheer cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint tapping on the window made Sariana spin around. The diaphanous skirts of her gown swirled weightlessly. She barely stifled a scream when she saw the dark figure on the opposite side of the glass. Then his eyes met hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gryph!\" She saw the way he was clutching one shoulder and a frantic sense of panic set in. He was hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving got her attention, Gryph stepped back into the shadows of the garden. Sariana didn\u0027t hesitate. She caught up her skirts in one hand and slipped quickly out of the alcove. She passed unnoticed through a tangle of laughing guests and a moment later she was safely out of the ballroom. Once she was clear of the hall, Sariana broke into a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short time later she was on the path that would bring her to the gardens directly outside the alcove. The glow of light through the windows guided her. She was almost on top of Gryph when he materialized out of the shadows. His eyes were silvery pools shimmering with an emotion that might have been pain or lust. Sariana assumed it was pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About time you got here,\" he muttered. He was still clutching his shoulder and swaying slightly on his feet. He looked somewhat the way he had the night he\u0027d been drugged with Aunt Peria\u0027s hypnotic potion. \"I\u0027m going to need a little help and I didn\u0027t want to startle any of the household attendants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re bleeding. There\u0027s blood all over you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all of it\u0027s mine. Help me get to my chambers, Sariana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana carefully took his uninjured arm and started down the garden path toward the wing of the house that contained their suites. \"I\u0027ll send one of the attendants for a medic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Gryph drew a deep breath. \"I\u0027ve already been to one. He closed the shoulder and put something on the wound for the pain before I could stop him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want to stop him from giving you a painkiller?\" Sariana demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a Shield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana was incensed. \"What difference does that make? Do Shields have to go around proving their bravery by refusing painkillers when they\u0027ve been hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has anyone ever told you that you have all the makings of a scold?\" Gryph retorted. \"With very little effort you could turn into a complete nag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With you for inspiration, I\u0027m willing to make the effort,\" she snapped. \"Now tell me what\u0027s going on here. Why didn\u0027t you want a painkiller?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some kinds of drugs don\u0027t work on a Shield the same way they do on other people. Remember the night you knocked me unconscious with that mild hypnotic you had Mara slip into my ale?\" His words sounded increasingly slurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana was stricken with guilt. \"I didn\u0027t realize it would affect you that way. I was assured it wouldn\u0027t combine with the alcohol into anything more potent than what it already was.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-25.html","bookId":1801,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM"}
