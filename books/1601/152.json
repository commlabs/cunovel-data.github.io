The oiled logs set flesh alight. The beasts yelled, howled and screeched depending on the orifice they’d been given. Ituralde raised his looking glass and watched them, feeling an intense satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was new. In the past, he’d never been satisfied to see his foes die. Oh, he’d been pleased when a plan worked. And, in truth, the point of fighting was to see the other fellow dead and your men alive—but there had been no joy in that. The longer you fought, the more you saw the enemy as being like yourself. The banners changed, but the rank and file were much the same. They wanted to win, but usually they were more interested in a good meal, a blanket to sleep on and boots without holes in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was different. Ituralde wanted to see those beasts dead. He lusted after it. Without them, he’d never have been forced to suffer the nightmare at Maradon. Without them, his hand wouldn’t shake when the horns of war sounded. They’d ruined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d ruin them in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs pushed through the jumble of logs with great difficulty. Many of them had been set alight, and the Myrddraal had to whip them to keep them moving. Many seemed to want to eat the flesh of the fallen. The rank scent of it made them hungry. Cooked bodies. To them, it was like the aroma of fresh bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fades succeeded in driving them on, but the Trollocs soon reached the next of Ituralde’s defenses. Figuring out what to do had been a trick. You couldn’t plant spikes or dig ditches in that solid rock, not without running your channelers to exhaustion. He could have made piles of rock or earth, but Trollocs were big, and mounds that would slow men were less effective against them. Beyond that, moving so much earth and stone would have meant diverting workers from building real fortifications in the valley. He’d learned early that in a defensive war, you wanted the fortifications to grow progressively better. You lasted longer that way, as you kept the enemy from gaining momentum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the solution had been simple. Brambles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d remembered huge thickets of them, dry and dead, back in Arad Doman. Ituralde’s father had been a farmer, and had always complained about the thorn thickets. Well, if there was one thing mankind was not lacking, it was dead plants. Another was manpower. Thousands had flocked to the Dragon’s call, and many of these Dragonsworn had little battle experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d still set them fighting when that time came. For now, however, he’d sent them to cut down enormous thornbushes. They’d placed these across the pass, lashed together, in masses twenty feet thick and eight feet tall. The thorn bales had been relatively easy to place—far lighter than stones or dirt—yet amassed as they were, the Trollocs couldn’t move them simply by pushing. The first ranks ran up against them and tried, but were rewarded with five-inch thorns biting into them. The creatures in the rear pressed forward, causing the front ranks to turn in anger and rise up against those behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis left the bulk of the Trolloc forces frozen in the pass, at his mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have much mercy for Shadowspawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIturalde gave the signal, and the Asha’man with him—Awlsten, one of those who had served under him at Maradon—shot a bright burst of red light into the sky. Along the sides above the pass, more Aiel came out and began to roll boulders and more burning logs down upon the trapped Shadowspawn. Arrows and stones followed—anything they could shoot, throw or drop onto those below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of these attacks from Ituralde’s men happened farther down the pass, in the middle of the bulk of Trollocs. That caused half to pull back and shy away, while the others pushed forward to get away—shoving their allies in front into the brambles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome Trollocs carried shields, and tried to protect themselves against the deadly hail. Wherever they formed together defensively and began to make a shield wall above themselves, Ituralde’s channelers struck, tearing them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t spare many channelers for the work—most were back in the valley, making gateways to move supplies and watching for enemy channelers. They’d already had a second run-in with Dreadlords. Aviendha and Cadsuane Sedai had those operations in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the Trollocs shot arrows at the defenders above, but casualties mounted as the Shadowspawn at the front tried to hack their way through the abatis of thorns. It was slow going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIturalde watched, cold inside and out, as the Myrddraal whipped the Trollocs into a stampede. That shoved the ones working on the thorns forward, impaling them, trampling them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood became a stream running back down toward the eastern end of the pass, making the Trollocs slip. They pushed the front five or six lines, breaking the thorns on the bodies of the beasts there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt still took them the better part of an hour to break through. They left thousands dead as they surged forward, then found a second abatis, thicker and higher than the first. Ituralde had placed seven at intervals in the pass. The second was the largest, and it had the desired effect. Seeing it made the Trollocs at the front pull up short. Then they turned and broke backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMass confusion resulted. Trollocs behind cried and shouted, pressing forward. Those in front snarled and howled as they tried to cut through the brambles. Some stood dazed. All the while arrows and rocks and burning logs continued to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beautiful\", Alsalam whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIturalde found that his arm was no longer quivering. He lowered his looking glass. \"Let’s go\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The battle is not through!\" the King protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is\", Ituralde said, turning away. \"For now\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue to his word, the entire Trolloc army broke behind him—he could hear it happening—and fled eastward down the pass, away from the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day held, Ituralde thought. They would be back on the morrow, and then they would be ready. More shields, better weapons at the front for cutting thorns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d still bleed. Bleed dearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d make certain of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Fragments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiuan let out a long, relieved breath as the Amyrlin—with eyes as if on fire—strode through the gateway and into their camp with Doesine, Saerin and several other Sitters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryne came through the gateway after them, hurrying up to Siuan. \"What was \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-152.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
