See you later, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenson wasn’t the officer investigating the accident that had injured two dozen people—several still in critical condition—and killed Sarah, but he offered any help Tyler and his Krewe might need. He also asked for an update on anything they’d discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the death of Julian Mitchell was engineered. But we don’t know why someone was rummaging through the attic, or if the same person tore apart the attic and killed Mr. Mitchell,” Tyler explained. “We also believe yesterday’s accident was maliciously planned with the intent to kill Sarah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve heard there was a snake in Ms. Vining’s car,” Jenson said. “That’s a far-fetched way to commit murder. The snake might just have crawled into the vehicle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did a snake happen to crawl into her car?” Tyler asked in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That snake was planted there,” Tyler insisted. “Oh, has anyone found it yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenson shook his head. “No one was looking for a snake. The car was towed to the impound. Of course, as soon as the PPD heard about the snakebite, we warned the men and women working the car to be careful and on the lookout for a snake. Thing is, that snake might be long gone by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or it might still be hiding in the car,” Tyler warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s true. I don’t think the vehicular people have examined the car yet. I’ll make a call as soon as we’re through.” He paused, his expression puzzled. “The real question is, why would anyone risk the lives of that many people to kill one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To make it look like an accident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t buy it,” Jenson told him, clearly not won over. “Are we talking about insanity here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So far, Sarah’s is the only death, but a few others are critical,” Tyler reminded him. “And I’m not suggesting that whoever’s doing this is insane. I just think the agenda this person has precludes caring about any collateral damage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can I do at my end?” Jenson asked. “If we find the creature—well, it’s unlikely a snake is going to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler was surprised; Jenson did seem to have a sense of wry humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but what you can do is check to see if any have been sold lately. Our murderer might have purchased the snake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agent Montague, this is Philadelphia. We’ve sent out an alert, but I doubt we’ll get anything. Copperheads are easy to find in the woods that surround the city,” Jenson said. “They show up in basements and garages. We’ve also contacted Philadelphia’s animal control, but they haven’t had anyone call to ask for a copperhead. But you’re right. We’ll follow every angle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoever is doing this is extremely clever. These murders have taken calculation and planning and they’ve required a certain level of risk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenson hesitated. “You’re sure they’re all murders?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m positive Sarah’s is. And there’s evidence of a blow on Julian Mitchell’s head. That proves someone shoved him down on that bayonet. So, yes, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenson still didn’t seem convinced, but he wasn’t argumentative. “What do you want from me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have your men keep an eye on Ethan Oxford, Nathan Pierson, Cherry Addison, Jason Lawrence and Annette Fanning,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a tall order and a lot of manpower. This is a big city. We have our share of crime, I’m afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you can’t have your officers tracking them every minute of every day. Ask them to keep an eye out for suspicious activity,” Tyler said. “Drive by their houses, check to see that they are where they’re supposed to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Ms. Leigh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was with us at the house yesterday, both before and during the accident,” Tyler told him. “Three of the board members were there shortly before the accident, as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we’ll take a closer look at the board members.” Jenson lifted his hands. “They’re dedicated to that place. Why would any of them want to commit murders—bizarre murders that are bound to cast a bad light on the house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we can figure out why, we’ll know who,” Tyler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, I’m going to see whether we can find out if one of them has taken a nice walk in the woods lately. I don’t believe our killer purchased the snake. And if they find the creature, maybe an expert can tell us more about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll work that angle, too, but since you’re local, you’re in a better position to pursue it,” Tyler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he was about to leave, Jenson’s phone rang. He raised one hand, asking Tyler to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he hung up. “They’ve found your snake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about Adam Harrison that drew people to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter taking a cold shower—the hot water supply had run out—and getting dressed, Allison was surprised to see Adam at the house, seated in their little enclave around Sean’s computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d sensed that he usually put one of his Krewes on a case and withdrew himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she arrived downstairs, he was there, together with Logan and Sean. When he saw her, he quickly rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dear,” he said, coming toward her. He took both of her hands. “I’m delighted to see you looking so much better. I’m delighted, as well, that you’ve chosen to assist my unit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m delighted that your unit is anxious to save my life,” she said, meaning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Naturally, our purpose is to save the lives of all we can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re still here,” she said. “Is that usual?” She smiled. “From what I understand, you’re all over the country, involved with law enforcement…and philanthropy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, well, Ethan and I go way back. He’s an old friend. Actually, he was my son Josh’s godfather. I felt this was a situation I should be here for, just in case I was needed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m happy to see you again,” Allison said. “Well, I guess I’ll be leaving soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’re not,” Kelsey said, sweeping into the room with a cup of coffee for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The trip to Valley Forge is postponed, because of the art showing tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And ‘all the king’s men’ will be there,” Adam murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Allison tried not to show her disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d looked forward to spending the day with Tyler, hoping for more—much more—than they’d experienced so far. Even if it couldn’t last…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the meantime Tyler has a couple of requests,” Logan told her. “He’s asked that you contact Mr. Standish and see if you can arrange an appointment for tomorrow. And would you look for that article online? The one that seems to be missing from the attic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. Tyler isn’t here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s checking in with the police.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand that one of the resident ghosts is trying to reach you.” Adam spoke in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe I’m a resident ghost now, and I’ve reached her just fine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t heard or seen Julian until he suddenly spoke behind her. She jumped, and Adam frowned. She realized he couldn’t see the ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another resident ghost,” Kelsey said, rolling her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have someone present?” Adam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julian Mitchell, my friend who was killed here,” Allison replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.” Adam wasn’t sure where to look, but he ventured a question. “Mr. Mitchell, have you been able to contact any of your fellow ghosts in this house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell him I’ve seen the ghost of Lucy Tarleton just like you’ve seen her—a wraith running away,” Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison repeated his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam turned thoughtfully to Logan and then to Allison. “My Krewes have seen so much and learned so much, and there’s still an infinite number of things we don’t understand. It’s impressive, I think, that Mr. Mitchell has so readily appeared to you. Was he an outgoing man in life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Painfully,” Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” Julian protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was a performer,” Allison said, feeling guilty about her earlier comment. “A very good performer,” she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam nodded. “Lucy Tarleton has been in this house for over two hundred years now. When she was alive, she was secretive by necessity. You may have to draw her out, and pay careful attention to every appearance she makes.” He smiled sadly. “I just see one soul here on earth—my son, Josh. It took a very long time, and then one day…one day he broke through to me. He is still the only soul I’m able to communicate with, but I ask nothing else. It’s through you, those who do have the gift, that I can try to help others. It’s a remarkable world when you have a greater vision,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam, we believe Lucy is saying something. And Allison will figure out what it is,” Logan assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now,” Allison said, “I’m going to the office to pull up that article and I’ll call Martin Standish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go with you,” Kelsey told her. When Allison looked at her sharply, Kelsey shrugged. “We need to take every precaution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam had already turned to speak with Logan and Sean as Kelsey and Allison started up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The shower must’ve been freezing,” Kelsey said. “I’m sorry. I should have warned you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It helped me wake up.” Allison laughed, and Kelsey joined in. The more she was with members of the Krewe, the more Allison liked them. They were like a family, trusting in one another and all working together at whatever task they were assigned. Of course, Kelsey and Sean were family, and Kelsey and Logan were a couple. The others had all known one another in Texas. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-uninvited-krewe-of-hunters-8/page-37.html","bookId":2282,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM"}
