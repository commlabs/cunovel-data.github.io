The moment he saw me, he pushed the microphone away and enfolded me in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came home with me. Mab still slept on the sofa; Juliet was nowhere to be seen. We tiptoed down the hallway to my room and closed the door, so softly it made no click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we did next was more than lovemaking. It was a uniting, a coming together so profound that every cell of my body confirmed that nothing could ever, ever pull us apart. Not the Night Hag, not the full moon, not the Destroyer’s mark. Not even my own fears. Whatever we’d meant to each other before, we deepened those feelings. Whatever hurts or disappointment we’d inflicted on each other in the past, we erased them. Together, we became something more. Something indestructible. Something that would stand together and face whatever came our way, no matter what that might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WOKE TO THE SOUND OF THE SHOWER RUNNING. HALF turning to check the time, I slid out from under Kane’s arm. He murmured something I didn’t catch, and then his eyes opened. When he saw me, pleasure filled those gray eyes, and he smiled sleepily. Troubles piled in jagged heaps all around us, but in the midst of them, we were together. I would not let him down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his hand along my shoulder and down my arm. Just a fleeting touch, but electric sparks shot through me as I felt his warmth, as I turned and snuggled against him, enclosed in his pine-and-moonlight scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I would not let this man down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought maybe that was you in the shower,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just checking.” I twisted around to see my bedside clock. “Almost seven.” We’d managed about three hours’ sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane groaned and rolled onto his back. “Midnight rallies do not mix well with eight-to-five jobs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you ever knock off work at five?” Or start as late as eight, for that matter. I heard the bathroom door open. “The shower’s free. If you get ready now, you can be at work on time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up and swung his legs over the edge of the bed. I watched the muscles ripple in his back as he stretched. Too bad Mab hadn’t slept in for an extra hour. Kane stood and walked across the room to the closet. Mmm . . . it was really too bad. I sighed as he put on the bathrobe he kept at my place. I pulled on my T-shirt and sweatpants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” he said, “I was planning to go in late. I think you, Mab, and I should discuss what to do about the Night Hag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re almost out of time. The sooner we brainstorm how to handle the situation, the better.” When I didn’t reply, he sat beside me and took my hand. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night, at the airport. When I . . .” I caught myself rubbing my demon mark and stopped. “She fell asleep so quickly last night. We haven’t talked about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about this: I’ll take my shower and get dressed, and then I’ll wait in here. You take all the time you need. If you can’t get matters resolved, then you and I will go out somewhere and talk over this Night Hag thing. But I think you will. Your aunt is the most reasonable, practical-minded woman I’ve ever met. More than that, though, she loves you. She wants to understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane kissed my cheek and headed for the bathroom. As I walked down the hall to face my aunt, I could only hope he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI FOUND MAB IN THE KITCHEN, RUMMAGING IN THE CUPBOARD beside the stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you keep your kettle?” she demanded before I’d said a word. “I’m parched for a cup of tea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll heat you some water in the microwave,” I said, taking down a mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That beastly contraption? I’m quite certain Rose would go on strike if I attempted to install one of those in my kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood in silence as the microwave whirred. I watched the mug spin around on the turntable, unable to pull my gaze away. The couple of minutes it took to heat the water passed more like a couple of centuries. Only after I’d taken out the mug, dropped in a tea bag, and handed Mab her drink could I manage to meet her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no anger there. No disappointment. What I saw looked more like compassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab held the mug in both hands, as if warming them. “As I told you, child, what happened last night wasn’t your fault. So we need not discuss it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But . . . at least let me tell you I’m sorry.” If I left those words unspoken, I couldn’t live with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Certainly. I accept your apology.” She dunked the tea bag in the hot water several times. “But if you feel you must apologize, I’d prefer you do it for keeping your father’s return a secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. There was that, too. “I promised Dad I wouldn’t tell anyone. Not until he had a chance to talk to Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you assumed I’d go running off to your mother with the news like some garden-variety village gossip. Honestly, Victory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promised.” Lousy as that excuse had turned out to be, it was the only one I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m pleased you’re someone who keeps her promises. But surely you could have asked Evan if he’d make an exception for me. After all, he hasn’t kept the secret himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same argument Kane had made. And it was just as right the second time. I’d made a bad assumption. Mab was family, and I figured that Dad wanted to tell her in his own time, just as he would with Mom and Gwen and the rest of the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is no time to be keeping secrets from me, child. We are on the brink of war, and I must be able to count on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we were back to that, the whole Lady of the Cerddorion thing. Last night’s events proved I wasn’t the Lady, and maybe now was the time to make my aunt understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mab,” I asked, “why did you come to Boston?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To help you assume your role.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we go again. “What role?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, Mab dunked her tea bag a few more times. Then she walked over to the trash can and dropped it in. She got the milk out of the fridge and poured a few drops into her tea. She took a sip, and then added another drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You,” she said, looking at me over the rim of her mug, “are the Lady of the Cerddorion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I started to object, she cut me off by holding up one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you’re going to say.” Mab pulled out a chair from the kitchen table. “Traditionally, that title belongs to Ceridwen, mother of our race.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush, child, and listen. The time has come for her to pass the title on. Sit down, you look pale. Shall I make you a cup of tea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thanks.” But an acute awareness of my coffee deficit suddenly hit me. I went through the motions of making a pot, my head spinning. Ceridwen, the goddess who’d created both shapeshifters and demi-demons, was sometimes called Lady of the Cerddorion. But that had nothing to do with me. If some long-lost goddess was passing on her title, it was going to Mab. I had to make her understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the biggest mug I could find out of the cupboard and filled it before the coffee had finished brewing. Then I joined Mab, who sat at the table waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” I said. “I’m sitting down. But you’re wrong, Mab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot me one of her “don’t be cheeky” looks, then cleared her throat. I had the feeling her next words were long rehearsed. “In the beginning, there was Ceridwen, mother to our race. She had two sons—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avagddu and Taliesin.” A classic story of the bad son and the good son, like Cain and Abel. Night and day, darkness and light. Even their names reflected the archetype: Avagddu means “utter darkness,” while Taliesin was named for the shining beauty of his face. Avagddu was greedy and destructive; Taliesin was talented and wise from the day he was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab nodded. “The Morfran was formed by cries of hunger and rage that issued from Avagddu. He also created demons and became the progenitor of all demi-demons. Taliesin, the wizard and bard, was the first of our kind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know all this, Mab.” How could I not? The Book of Utter Darkness had burned the story into my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me explain in my own way, child,” Mab said sharply. But her tone softened as she continued. “Ceridwen gave part of her own nature to each child: Avagddu was created from the shadows within her spirit, and Taliesin from the light. Because of this, as her sons grew and thrived, she weakened. Her last act of magic before she faded away was to lay a burden upon the females of her line. Daughters of Avagddu would be barren. Daughters of Taliesin would lose their powers if they gave birth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So she cursed us. Both lines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe Ceridwen saw it as such. Looking at Avagddu’s line, the Meibion Avagddu, she understood the lust for power that’s fundamental to the race. After all, it came from the darkest places of her own soul. So she curbed that line by limiting its ability to propagate—or she tried to. By that time, her magic was weak and imperfect, and some female demi-demons have reproduced, although always with great difficulty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her magic seems to have stuck it to our side pretty well.” Every Cerddorion mother I’d ever known—my grandmothers, Mom, Gwen, countless second and third cousins—had lost her ability to shapeshift with motherhood. Gwen had never wanted anything besides her house in the suburbs and her family, but Mom had been an active demon fighter before she met Dad. She’d never talked about it much, but the decision couldn’t have been easy for her. Shapeshifting powers or family—it was the impossible choice all Cerddorion females faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, well, some do see her action as ‘sticking it,” as you put it, to her Cerddorion descendants, but I do not believe that is what Ceridwen intended. Her own children drained her, to the extent that she faded away. She did not want her daughters to suffer the same fate.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hellhound-deadtown-5/page-29.html","bookId":2613,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:42:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:42:11 PM"}
