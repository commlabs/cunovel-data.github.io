Despite its simplicity, she knew it was no ordinary ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand trembled as he slid it onto her ring finger, under the rain-drenched sunlight falling through the skylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackson, this is so lovely.\" Her voice was barely a whisper as, sittingup, she stared at the ancient gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was slow. \"The ring was my paternal grandmother\u0027s. Her name wasGia and she was married to my grandfather Josef for over fifty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes smarted with tears. No one had ever given her something so precious, so from the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\" She rubbed at her eyes with her free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Piccola.\" He reached out and pulled her from the blankets and onto his lap, pressing her cheek against his chest. Instead of fear at the intimacy, she felt a fierce sense of belonging. \"Why do you cry like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden change in the cadence of his voice startled her. \"You sound so Italian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Italian.\" He stroked her hair in that way of his. She\u0027d never imagined that such a big man could be so incredibly tender. \"Have you stopped crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She kept her head against his chest. \"Thank you for the ring.\" She wanted to ask if Bonnie had ever worn it but couldn\u0027t find the courage. After all, despite the hurt that his first wife had caused him, he\u0027d loved her when they\u0027d married. It hadn\u0027t been just a bargain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ring has been sitting in a vault for ten years. You will bring it to the light once more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words made her heart swell. Maybe it was selfish, but she wanted a part of him that Bonnie hadn\u0027t seen and hurt. She didn\u0027t know the details of what they\u0027d done to each other, but she knew that the results had devastated the man holding her so very carefully. The feel of his hard body made her want to luxuriate in him, but the slight tension in his muscles reminded her that this wasn\u0027t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved off his lap. \"I\u0027ll meet you downstairs for breakfast\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; I\u0027ll cook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll look forward to it.\" He rose at once, and with a pang in her heart, she knew that he\u0027d been waiting for the moment when she\u0027d set him free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, she watchedJacksonpick up a fork and use the edge to cut the corner off a pancake. She watched his lips as he forked in the bite, and somewhere along the way her desire to know if he enjoyed her cooking was overcome by the urge to taste his lips. To try and see if she could come out of sexual deep freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe short accolade snapped her out of her sudden, sensual need to explore the man she was going to marry. Quickly, she choked down some of her own breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll marry within the week,\"Jacksonsaid after she\u0027d taken a few bites, his tone matter-of-fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth felt fuzzy with nervous tension, but she managed to ask, \"Won\u0027t a sudden marriage look odd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a brow. \"We\u0027ve been secretly seeing each other for months, not wishing to be dogged by paparazzi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe acknowledged the compliment with a wry smile. \"Valetta did something like that when she decided she was ready for marriage. That lasted about six months\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; a record even in my family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is your sister anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Haven\u0027t seen her for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you care?\" She couldn\u0027t hide her disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family is not close like you and Nick.\" His clipped response didn\u0027t encourage further conversation on that topic. Strung taut as she was, she didn\u0027t have the inclination to pursue it today. \"I believe we can be married by Tuesday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tuesday.\" She put down her fork. \"Registry?\" A twinge of pain arrowed through her heart. Despite the nature of their bargain, she didn\u0027t want this marriage to start out so very practically, devoid of any hint of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if that is what you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" She looked up, wondering at the change inJackson\u0027s speech rhythms. As usual, it had happened without warning. At first, she\u0027d thought it was caused by strong emotion, but that couldn\u0027t be true, because he was very calm. Whatever it was, the more Italian he sounded, the worse her self-control became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is an isolated farmstead about an hour out by helicopter. It is often used as a wedding venue. I\u0027ve checked and we can have it for Tuesday if we want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s Sunday today! We couldn\u0027t organize everything by then ... could we?\" Hope blossomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis beautifully shaped lips gentled into a smile. \"If we could, do you want the farmhouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027d like to invite some friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next few hours,Taylorlearned about the power of money and charisma. Shops opened just for them, caterers called in relief staff, florists ordered shipments of flowers in special air packages and a couturier flew in from a weekend retreat to show her his wedding collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in, come in.\"The little artiste waved them through to his upstairs showroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlustered, she looked up at the darkly beautiful man who was her companion. \"Jackson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.\" He bent his head a little, hand on her lower back. She\u0027d always guessed that he was a possessive man and he\u0027d let her see that side of him today. No one who met her was in any doubt that she was nowSantorini\u0027s woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylorfelt ambivalent about the claiming. Part of her was delighted. But, another part of her, the lost, lonely, abandoned girl, was terrified. Yes, he was claiming her now but there was a time limit on their relationship. If she didn\u0027t give him what he wanted, he\u0027d abandon her, just like everyone else. The brutal truth was that this was nothing more than a business deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaced with the couturier, she was lost. \"What am I supposed to do?\" she askedJackson, her voice a whisper. She had never been a rich girl, in spite of Lance\u0027s wealth. He\u0027d never treated them to any luxury, and had begrudged them every penny he did spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson\u0027s hand curved over her hip, blatantly proprietary. \"You\u0027re a very valued customer. Take only what appeals.\" The caress in his voice touched her deep within, even though she tried to remain unmoved. How could she hope to resist the one man who\u0027d never let her down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he came all this way for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows I\u0027ll remember that when we need a wedding dress for one of the new movies in the works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry, cara , he will get his payment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolstered by his confidence, she started to look through the many beautiful creations brought out for her inspection.Jacksonspent a lot of time on his mobile phone, checking on security details for their wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was while he was standing by the window, phone to his ear, that she found the dress she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How very lovely.\" She picked up the smooth satin-silk fabric, which looked like it had been embedded with pearls crushed to the consistency of the finest white sand. The dress had a cowl neck which would drape softly over her breasts, before the sleek material swept gracefully down her body. The bias cut ensured it would hug her curves and swish gently around her ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to try this on.\" She glanced over her shoulder to ensureJacksonwasn\u0027t looking her way. \"I don\u0027t want him to see it before the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man was delighted to help in her conspiracy. \"Use the back fitting room and if you like it, I\u0027ll box it up out of his sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfect fit, as if it had been made with her in mind. The couturier gave her a shimmering gossamer veil to go with the dress, and even found a pair of shoes.Jacksonsimply raised a brow at her secretiveness but paid for the purchase with a gold card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s costing you a lot,\" she said, in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my choice,Taylor. It\u0027s my wedding, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t make her feel much better. \"I don\u0027t understand,\" she burst out, raw from the evidence of his wealth and her lack of it. \"What do you get out of this? There are so many women out there who wouldn\u0027t hesitate to bear you a child.\" Women who weren\u0027t flawed, she thought. Women he wouldn\u0027t have to rid himself of after a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get you and I get Nick, two people whose loyalty will be mine without question. In this business, loyalty like that is priceless.\" His tone was forceful. \"And, I may get to father a baby, who I know will have a good mother\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; there aren\u0027t many women whom I\u0027d trust with that responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksoncould see thatTaylorwasn\u0027t convinced, but he knew that she wouldn\u0027t protest. Not when Nick\u0027s future was at stake. He barely understood his own need, need which had been hidden for so long that it was starving for a taste of her. He just knew that he had a chance to makeTaylorhis and he was taking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw herself as without passion, damaged. He saw in her the promise of a magnificent woman. He wasn\u0027t a saint and he wanted her. But neither was he a brutal man who would force compliance. That didn\u0027t mean he wouldn\u0027t try to find the sensual woman in Taylor, the one who made him feel things he hadn\u0027t felt for so long he\u0027d thought them dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had pained him to admit that the ache to father a child was so great he would give her up if she couldn\u0027t bring herself to bear his touch. Yet, it was the truth. He\u0027d never wanted much in his life, but he wanted to hold his child in his arms. How could someone as innocent asTaylorunderstand his need to find redemption by creating a life where Bonnie had destroyed it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylorspent that night at home. She rose at seven the next day and was ready an hour later to go and pick up Nick, who would be dropped off at the school with the other children.Jacksonwas on her doorstep just after eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of him rattled her. She\u0027d just spent hours dreaming of him and none of the dreams had been comfortable. It was as if her own mind was taunting her with what could be. \"I don\u0027t know if you should come,\" she finally said. \"I know I invited you but it might be too sudden.\" Her worry was genuine but she also needed time alone to sort out her tumultuous feelings. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-10.html","bookId":1881,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM"}
