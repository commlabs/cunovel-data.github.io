Now, we sat with the other Thurmans - or a few of them at least - on a wide balcony that overlooked the grounds. As Allison ate and I drank water, I caught her up to speed on the night\u0027s events. When I was finished, I said, \"Your mouth\u0027s hanging open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It tends to do that when I\u0027m shocked shitless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shushed her. Although we were alone at our little patio table, there were still other Thurmans eating nearby. The morning had been shockingly clear and warm, so much so that breakfast had been served outside. There was a nearby table filled with heaps of eggs and breakfast meats and pancakes. Someone had cooked up a storm. Many nodded at us as we sat and talked. Noticeably absent was Edwin Thurman and our hostess, Tara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where is the man of the hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003easked Allison. She was, of course, talking about Edwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In his room,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, the basement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know this how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got mad skills,\" I said. Although Allison was a close friend, she was still a new friend. She didn\u0027t know the extent of what I could do. Truth was, I didn\u0027t know the extent of what I could do either. So, for an explanation, I gave her a glimpse now into my memory, showing her what I\u0027d done - and what I had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked after a moment. \"You can remote sense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez, the government\u0027s been training psychics for decades trying to get them to do what you can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I can\u0027t see very far, maybe only a few hundred feet or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far enough. I saw the image of him lying there on his little cot, sleeping. Very clear image. Very precise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very weird,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, weird or not, it\u0027s helpful...and why the hell is he lying on a cot, in the basement, in this beautiful home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they ran out of beds,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe it\u0027s because he\u0027s a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and lowered my voice. \"No. Not a vampire. He\u0027s something else. He\u0027s different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different, how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greater. More powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught the meaning of my words and also caught my own vaguely formulated thought. \"Sam,\" she said. \"Do you really think he might be the greatest of them all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison and I had previously discussed the thing that resides in me. She understood that it was this thing that fueled me and gave me eternal life. She understood that this thing needed to be fed, and blood was its choice. She understood that the powers within it emanated out to me, making me stronger and stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I don\u0027t know yet. I don\u0027t know much about these entities. I don\u0027t know why they\u0027ve been banished, and why they want back in. I don\u0027t understand the kind of magicks needed to give them access to me, and to live within me forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you think the thing that lives in Edwin Thurman might be the strongest of them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what my gut is telling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. \"Well, I can tell you one thing: I can tell you who\u0027s high on my suspect list of who killed George Thurman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know if he killed him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he certainly sounds like he\u0027s got it in for you, Sam. Did he really say his sister is inside you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you vampires are weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s the game plan, Sammie? Other than me keeping you alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keeping me alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s got to, kiddo. My sensitivities may not be as strong as yours, but I am getting a very, very strong feeling that not all is as it seems on Skull Island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very melodramatic,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And very real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell phone went off. I looked down at it: Danny. The ex. Allison saw it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to answer?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rang again. I drummed my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said irritably, and clicked on. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-20.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
