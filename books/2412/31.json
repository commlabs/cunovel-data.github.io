She keeps him talking, keeps working him around. I swear to God, I don\u0027t know how she does it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been nearly four hours now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He could see the snipers from where he stood, see them on rooftops, in windows, doorways. What if they opened up? What if Ma or Loo got in the way of a bullet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of it had him lowering to a crouch on legs that had gone to water. \"If it was money-God, why isn\u0027t it about money? I\u0027d-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Phin hunkered down beside him. \"I know, Dune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phoebe, she... She keeps bringing him back to the hostages. Asking how they\u0027re doing, talking to him about letting some of them go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked if we could have their names, but he doesn\u0027t know, doesn\u0027t care. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s good or bad. I just don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s taking too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that either.\" He laid a hand over Phin\u0027s, linked their fingers. \"Take care of the family. You take care of the family, and I\u0027ll go back in, see if there\u0027s anything else I can find out, anything I can do.\" Despite the air-conditioning, the air in the boutique hung hot and thick. The door opened and closed countless times as cops pushed in and out, so the steamy heat crawled in and set up shop. Sweat gleamed on Phoebe\u0027s skin as she studied the situation board, read over her own notes, made more. In a desperate attempt to keep some part of her cool, she\u0027d snagged a tortoiseshell clip from a display to yank her hair up. She chugged down water as she stared at the red X\u0027s marked on the layout of the jewelry store. Kill marks, she thought. Move him to any of those locations, and Tactical had the green light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had experts move in at the rear door,\" Harrison told her. \"Examine the rig there. They think they can defuse it and circumvent the alarm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re pretty damn sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re getting impatient. You know as well as I do everyone\u0027s wanting to move, to act. That\u0027s the danger of long negotiations. I need more time. He\u0027s going to have to move those people soon. Bladders only hold so long, and that\u0027s our best option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sergeant Meeks wants to know how his boy\u0027s doing. You can\u0027t blame him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t tell me.\" Phoebe swiped one of the baby wipes Liz had passed her over her face to mop up the sweat. \"Tell him I\u0027ll try to find out next round.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t move him within the next hour, I\u0027m going to let the bomb squad take that rig. He\u0027s not coming out alive, you know that. Bringing him down\u0027s the only way to minimize casualties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll move him, damn it. It may take a little longer, but I\u0027ll move him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes much longer, you\u0027ll make a mistake. That\u0027s why you work in teams, Phoebe. As long as it\u0027s only you and him, you\u0027re going to tire out and make a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants me to make a mistake. And the theme of this party is he doesn\u0027t get what he wants. He\u0027s not ready to end it yet, because he wants something from me first. And until he is ready, those people are as safe as we can make them. I\u0027ll know when he\u0027s ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrison walked out as Duncan walked in. Phoebe lifted her eyebrows as she spotted the bags of takeout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured food would come in handy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the thought of eating made her nauseous, but eating was necessary, and might keep her from making that mistake. \"You\u0027re my hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the bags down, where they were attacked by cops, then moved to her. \"Whose turn is it to call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m letting him make the move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He rubbed her shoulders. \"I talked to your mom. Everyone\u0027s all right there, some worried about you. This, ah, siege is all over the news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one of the things he wants I couldn\u0027t stop.\" She let her head rest on his shoulder, rested her mind there. \"I haven\u0027t had anyone take care of me in a long time. I could get used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Phin-and the rest of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re terrified. I\u0027m not.\" They both knew it was a lie, but it was a comforting one. \"I know you\u0027ll get them out safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you hear when he talks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He goes up and down, right and left, b u\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under it all? I guess what I hear is satisfaction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you listen well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa Bee\u0027s back ached, her head throbbed. Pretty, blond Patsy had given up crying and was now curled up on the floor with her head in Ma\u0027s soft lap. There were murmurs and whispers among the hostages-something the man in charge didn\u0027t seem to mind, or maybe didn\u0027t tune his ears to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them dozed, as if they might open their eyes again and find this had all been a strange, awful dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phin must be so scared,\" Loo said quietly. \"Livvy. He wouldn\u0027t tell Livvy. I don\u0027t want her to be scared. Oh, Ma, my baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine. You know she\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why doesn\u0027t he do something? When the hell is he going to do something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, honey. But I gotta do something. I gotta pee.\" There were murmured agreements, even a few weak laughs. \"I\u0027ll ask,\" Loo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, let me. Motherly type might have better luck. Mister!\" Ma called out before Loo could object. \"Hey, mister! Some of us here need to use the facilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d called out to him before and been ignored. But this time he turned, the phone in his hand, and looked at Ma with dead eyes. \"Been hours now,\" she reminded him. \"Unless you want a big puddle down here, you\u0027re going to have to let us use the bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to hold it awhile longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised the gun. \"If I put a bullet in you, you won\u0027t be worried about pissing. Now shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had a schedule, and he\u0027d slipped up. Hour three break was when he\u0027d meant to shuffle the hostages, one by one, into the toilet. Whether they wanted to go or not. But he\u0027d forgotten, and now it was time to make the call, goddamn it. So they\u0027d hold it until the next break, or they\u0027d piss themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I want ten million dollars?\" he said to Phoebe. \"Do you want ten million dollars, Jerry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen to her, he thought, butter wouldn\u0027t fucking melt. \"Let\u0027s toss it out there, kick it around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. What do I get for the ten million if I can get that for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t shoot a hostage in the head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well now, that\u0027s a negative response, Jerry. You know if I could, and I can\u0027t promise I can, but if I could convince my superiors to approve that ten million, there\u0027d have to be a more positive quid pro quo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I said for ten million, I\u0027d think about releasing the female hostages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d consider releasing the women if I can offer ten million? That\u0027s worth talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is, Jerry, you\u0027ve got an injured man in there, too. You did tell me Arnold Meeks was injured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down where Arnie slumped, dried blood on his face, tape slapped over his mouth. And explosives strapped on his body. \"He\u0027s had better days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before I can approach anyone about the money, I have to be assured that Arnold Meeks is alive, and his injuries aren\u0027t life-threatening. You know who his daddy is, Jerry. I\u0027ve got some pressure on me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cocksucker\u0027s alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate you assuring me he\u0027s alive, but I\u0027d have more muscle if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear him tell me himself. If I can pass along I\u0027ve heard his voice, they\u0027ll get off my back and you and I can concentrate on the important business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set down the phone, stepped over, leaned down and ripped the tape from Arnie\u0027s mouth. Arnie\u0027s blackened, bloodshot eyes rolled up. \"Say hi to Phoebe, asshole.\" Walken snatched the phone, held it to Arnie\u0027s ear. And jammed the barrel of the gun under Arnie\u0027s jaw. \"Say this: Hi, Phoebe, I\u0027m the cowardly asshole who kicked your murdering ass down the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie\u0027s eyes, full of rage and terror, stayed on Walken\u0027s as he repeated the statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are your injuries?\" Phoebe demanded. \"How bad are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie moistened his lips. \"She wants to know about my injuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go on and tell her, fuckhead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He pistol-whipped me across the face. I think my cheekbone\u0027s busted. I\u0027m cuffed, and he\u0027s got a goddamn bomb strapped to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it on a timer? Is it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll be enough,\" Walken told her. \"Now about that ten million.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want ten million dollars to release the hostages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten million to release the female hostages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten million to release the women. How many women are there, Jerry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven. That\u0027s less than a million a head. Hell of a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven women, who you\u0027d release if I can offer you ten million dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop fucking echoing. I know the drill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know that I\u0027d have a stronger chance of getting you what you want after a show of faith. If you\u0027d release some of the hostages now, including any of those injured or with medical conditions, I\u0027d try damn hard to get you that ten million.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, screw ten million. Let\u0027s make it twenty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re yanking my chain, Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a laugh. \"I thought about killing you, Phoebe. A thousand times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you thought about it, why didn\u0027t you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A thousand ways. A bullet in the brain. Much too clean. Grabbing you like I did Roy, doing you like I did him. But I don\u0027t like repeating myself. Beating you to death, or keeping you alive for days, just putting holes in you. But then it\u0027d be over for you, like it is for Angie. You don\u0027t deserve what she got. How about this, you come on in here. Just you, and I let them all go. Every one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know they won\u0027t let me do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You come in, seventeen people live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d trade all the hostages for me. Is that a real offer, Jerry, or are you yanking me again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t do it. You\u0027re nothing but talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I would?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t let you. You think I\u0027m stupid? You think I\u0027ve forgotten how it works?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t, but have you forgotten that you\u0027ve got Sergeant Meeks\u0027s son in there, injured. He\u0027s got pull. Is it a real offer, Jerry? Me for all seventeen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about it. But you\u0027re going to do something else first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else would you like me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to go out there, in front of all the cameras. You\u0027re going to give a statement on how you killed Angela Brentine. How you\u0027re responsible for her death. How you cared more about running your mouth and playing big shot than saving her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to speak to the press, Jerry, give a statement about the death of Angela Brentine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to say exactly what I tell you to say, exactly when I tell you to say it. Then we\u0027ll see about the money and the hostages.\" He hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could rise, Duncan pulled her right out of her chair. \"If you even think about trading yourself, I\u0027ll knock you out, lock you up until you get your senses back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought about it when it was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my mother in there, the only one I\u0027ve ever really had. And screw this, I\u0027m not debating or arguing, or anything else. You\u0027re not going near that building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chill out,\" Sykes ordered. \"She\u0027s not trading herself. We don\u0027t work that way.\" He looked hard at Phoebe. \"Not ever. This isn\u0027t Hollywood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bought it.\" She jabbed a finger at Duncan, then at Sykes. \"You know better, but you bought it. I promise you he did. He wasn\u0027t expecting me to consider it. He was screwing with me again, and I threw him off by giving the demand any credence. He bought it, he\u0027s thinking about it. What he wanted, expected, was to get me to agree to make the statement. Or to refuse. I do either, it\u0027s over. That\u0027s what he\u0027s waiting for, my public confession. But now he\u0027s thinking what it would be like if I came inside. If he had me in there. So how do we use it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show of faith,\" Sykes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s first. Get him to release some of the hostages-and before there\u0027s any agreement or refusal on the statement. Because that was his green light. We stall. Put us on the same side on this issue. I want to go make the statement, but they\u0027re dicking around on it. I want to go in, but they\u0027re stonewalling. I\u0027m trying to work it so he gets what he wants. I\u0027m frustrated because it\u0027s taking so long to get the go on it. He\u0027s used to following a plan, an outline.\" She looked at Vince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess, yeah. Ah, it\u0027s training. You have to adjust, sure, to think on your feet, but it\u0027s all within the outline. You train for variables. But he likes... order? I guess that\u0027s the word I want. He\u0027s not real impulsive. He\u0027d rather figure it through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing that now. Does he want to go through with his original plan-blow it all up, himself included, while I live, disgraced but breathing? Or, if he gets the opportunity, wouldn\u0027t he rather take it down to the two of us? The hostages aren\u0027t anything to him, but they\u0027re everything to me. That was the idea. But to be able to look me in the eyes when he sets off that bomb, that\u0027s going to be tempting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s tired,\" Duncan added. \"You can hear it in his voice. So are you. He probably hears it in yours. He\u0027s getting closer to ending it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he\u0027s closer, bringing up the press statement, that\u0027s his lead into the final stage. Now this has given him something else to chew on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Activity inside.\" Sykes held up his hand for silence as he listened to his radio. \"No visual on the subject, but the hostage identified as the owner is untying two of the women. Got a clear view. One hostage, female, black, middle age, walking toward the rear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Ma Bee,\" Duncan murmured while fear closed a vise on his heart. \"It\u0027s got to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa walked back to the bathroom as directed. She moved slower than she needed to, even hobbled a bit though it hurt her pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made her leave the door open, which seriously offended her sense of propriety. Still, she peed like a racehorse and looked around for a weapon of any kind while her grateful bladder emptied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t a fool. He was going to kill them all. If she could hurt him, even a little, she\u0027d have some satisfaction on the way to Jesus. But there was nothing to grab. A bottle of liquid soap, a little dish of potpourri that wasn\u0027t worth the throwing at the man\u0027s head. In any case, he had that damn gun in that security guard\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuffled out again, kept her eyes downcast as if cowed. \"I\u0027m Beatrice. They call me Ma Bee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, get back in the circle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to thank you for letting me go first, before I embarrassed myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t shut up and go sit back down like I tell you, you\u0027re the last one who goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as she was told, but she\u0027d seen he had another gun, and more ammunition, in one of the boxes he\u0027d wheeled in. More important, she\u0027d seen what she thought had to be the detonator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has to be the bathroom break,\" Sykes told her. \"The way they\u0027re moving from the circle to the rear, one at a time. First hostage is back. She\u0027s... Tactical says she\u0027s signaling. Signing. Three handguns, one rifle, ammo, detonator, rear right corner with bad guy, injured guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Count on Ma,\" Duncan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get us the hell out of here,\" Sykes finished and pulled out a smile. \"I\u0027m calling him back while he\u0027s moving them back and forth, while he\u0027s got to divide his attention. Let\u0027s push him on the deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, three times, four. Just as she was worried he wouldn\u0027t pick up, his voice snapped on. \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Jerry, I wanted to tell you about the deal. I can\u0027t promise yet, but... If you can\u0027t talk to me now, I\u0027ll wait and tell you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You\u0027re not going to snow me, tell me you\u0027re going to make the statement, make the trade, just like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not trying to snow you, just keep you in the loop. I don\u0027t want anybody to get hurt. The chief doesn\u0027t like the statement-politics, you know how it is. But I\u0027m working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Politicians like their scapegoats. You tell the chief if he doesn\u0027t give the go on it, if you\u0027re not in front of those cameras inside the hour, we\u0027re down to sixteen hostages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to tell him, Jerry. I\u0027m going to tell him that all you want is for me to make a statement about my responsibility for Angela\u0027s death, and you\u0027ll let everyone go. Is that right, Jerry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a change of plans. You come in. We\u0027ll use one of these camera phones for the statement, transmit it. That\u0027s how we\u0027re going to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll trade me for the hostages, is that what you\u0027re telling me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill not going to let them go. \" Arnie\u0027s daddy\u0027s pushing for it, like I expected he would. I haven\u0027t even had a chance to think it through myself and he\u0027s banging his fist. Jesus, he\u0027s a hard case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You burn, his asshole son doesn\u0027t. No-brainer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For him, maybe. I just want to talk to you, Jerry, I just want to find a way out of this. If talking to me face-to-face can help... But you know they want something up front. How many would you give us?\" There was a brief hesitation, and in it Phoebe read the lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You in, they\u0027re out. That\u0027s the deal-if I decide to make it. Keep your eyes on the ground like I told you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not talking to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just... hold on, hang on, they\u0027re bringing me something.\" She clicked the phone to mute it, and prayed she was right in going with her gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going to let any of them out, even if you could make the deal. You\u0027re tired,\" Sykes continued, \"maybe you can\u0027t hear-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can. I can hear it. Tell them to move on the rear, but not until I signal. To move in, front and back, but not until I give the go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re right,\" she told Sykes. \"He\u0027s not going to let any of them out for this. But if I can move him far enough away from the detonator, they can take him-maybe take him alive. Go in, front and back, they can take him. On my say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Duncan demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking a chance. Jerry? Sorry, Jerry, you know how it gets. Jerry, I\u0027ve got her diary. I have Angela\u0027s diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lying bitch, she didn\u0027t have a diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not lying, Jerry. You know I have to be able to back up what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say. She was a woman in love, and she couldn\u0027t tell anyone who you were, or the way things really were between you. So she wrote it down. That bastard Brentine didn\u0027t tell us about it, just like he didn\u0027t tell us she was wearing your ring when she died. Had to save his pride and reputation. They got a warrant, and they found it. She called you Lancelot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard his choked breath. \"Read it to me. Read it, so I know you\u0027re not lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe flipped through her notes so it sounded like flipping pages, and pulled out the information she had on Angela. \"You gave her pink roses-they were her favorite. She\u0027s got a pink rose pressed in the pages here. She loved when you cooked for her, loved to watch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read it. I want her words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tit for tat, Jerry. I want to give you her words, but you have to give me something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read a page, and if I know it\u0027s her words, I\u0027ll let a hostage go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, she heard truth. \"Let five hostages go, I\u0027ll read a page. She wanted to build Camelot with you. Let five go and I\u0027ll read it. Let them all go, and I\u0027ll find a way to bring it in with me and you can read it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bring it out where I can see it. Nobody goes out until I know you\u0027ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to bring it out? I can try to work that. If I bring it where you can see it, what will you give me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three of them. Bring it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three hostages go out if I bring her diary where you can see it? Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me clear it. I\u0027m going to start down there with it, and try to clear it on the way. I\u0027ll have to call you back on my cell. Is that all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved up, grabbed her cell phone. \"Somebody get me something that looks like a diary, a journal. Nothing too big. I want you patched in,\" she told Sykes. \"When I say: It\u0027s all 1 can do, Jerry, that\u0027s the go. Exactly those words, Bull. I won\u0027t say them if there\u0027s another way, if I believe we can talk him down or take him alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This do?\" Duncan offered her a fancy address book with an embossed red leather cover he\u0027d grabbed off a display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect, unless she hated red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know he\u0027d go for this?\" Duncan asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s personal, intimate. Something that was hers. Her speaking to him, and something he hadn\u0027t factored in. He\u0027ll trade for it, there\u0027s a good chance he\u0027ll trade for it. I need to coordinate with the commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going with you as far as I can go,\" Duncan added. \"What\u0027s to stop him from just shooting you the minute you\u0027re in view?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants the book. More, if he gets a bead on me, they\u0027ll have one on him. He shows a weapon, they\u0027ll end it. He\u0027s distracted, people are moving around. He hasn\u0027t stopped the bathroom break. He\u0027s off his stride now, churned up, and he\u0027s made a mistake. We have to capitalize on it. Commander, I can move him away from the detonator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe explained her plan, shrugged into the vest someone passed her. \"Once he\u0027s away, I\u0027ll keep him there, or, if I\u0027m lucky, bring him closer to the display window. When the rear door\u0027s clear-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take it from there. You move any closer than I\u0027ve cleared, it\u0027s over, we sweep you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood.\" She turned to Duncan. \"You can\u0027t come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better damn right come back to me.\" He gripped her hand. \"Not negotiable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal.\" Her fingers tightened on his, and in his eyes she saw both his fear and his faith. \"I love you,\" she said, then walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might take the shot, she knew, if he was quick enough, smart enough. Odds were against it, but she hadn\u0027t been completely truthful. She ordered herself not to look back, because Duncan might see the lie in her eyes, and the fear with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother, she thought, his sister. His lover. What happened in the next few minutes would determine if any, or all, of them came back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled out her cell, called Jerry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m heading down now. You need to get the hostages ready. Three hostages, Jerry, that was the deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what the damn deal was. I see you, I see it, before anybody gets out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see me, but you won\u0027t see Angela\u0027s diary until three people are out. You have to work with me, Jerry. You\u0027ll still have fourteen. You didn\u0027t know how many people would be in there when you planned this. There might only have been fourteen to begin with. You\u0027re not losing anything, and you\u0027re proving to me you keep a deal. I show it to you for three, and I\u0027ll read you a page for three more. Then we\u0027ll talk about the trade. That\u0027s a fair deal, Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLies, she thought, she was full of lies now. Did he hear them? If she failed, could she live with it? Could Duncan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the chatter through her earpiece. The rear rig was boobytrapped and set with an alarm. It would take time she wasn\u0027t sure she had to bypass and defuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork with what you\u0027ve got, she reminded herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tactical needs to see the three hostages, Jerry. They\u0027ve got me blocked; they won\u0027t let me through until they seem them.\" Movement. Three females... moving toward the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got the nod, stepped out from cover. In the swampy heat, her flesh goosebumped with ice. \"I\u0027m here, Jerry. First part of the deal. Now your part. Let them go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I come any closer, Tactical\u0027s going to swarm me and push me back. I\u0027m at the southwest of the building. I can see the display window, and make out one-no, two people standing just to the right of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid to wear a vest, Phoebe, when I\u0027d put one in your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awful amusement in his voice stripped all the moisture from her throat. \"I know, but rules are rules. Let them out, Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see the diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her hand behind her back. \"I kept my word, time to keep yours. Then it\u0027ll be my turn again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe locks clicked, the door flew open. People ran or stumbled out, weeping, shouting, \"Don\u0027t shoot!\" Cops in body armor rushed to pull and drag them to cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of her eye, Phoebe saw Ma Bee, and sent up a quick prayer of thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan\u0027s mother was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My girl\u0027s still in there,\" Ma shouted. \"He\u0027s hiding behind her, hiding behind the others. He\u0027s got the detonators. He\u0027s got two of them.\" The prayer died in her throat. She watched a wild-eyed woman come forward and shut the door again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s three. Show me the book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Jerry. Tactical needs to clear the civilians out of the inner perimeter. That\u0027s a clear.\" She brought the book from behind her back. \"I have Angela\u0027s diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open it. Open it and read. That could be any damn thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need three more hostages.\" And though it went against her heart, she followed training. \"I need the injured man with this group, Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck him. He stays, just like the rest. Want to see him, Phoebe?\" She saw the movement, and Arnie stumbling forward as if he\u0027d been shoved. His face was gray, the blood on it dried to black. As Roy\u0027s had been, his torso was imprisoned with the bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the barred glass, his bruised eyes met Phoebe\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You read, or I blow him. Going to take a few other people out and bring serious hurt to the others. But what the hell, I\u0027ll blow the big one, too, and that takes it all. You read now or it\u0027s done. No more negotiating.\" She opened the book, stared at the blank pages. Women in love, she thought, spoke the same language. So she read from her own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what love is now. How could I have thought I knew before him? Everything before is pale and soft and foolish. Now, now that I know love, the world\u0027s bright and strong and real. He makes me real.\" She closed the book. \"Send three people out, Jerry, and I\u0027ll read more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more out! No more. You read what she wrote. I want the cameras on you while you read what she wrote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerry-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you!\" He screamed it out so all his rage seemed to fill Phoebe\u0027s head. \"You read what she wrote, then you\u0027re going to give the statement. You do it now, you start it now, or I pick one and take her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe stepped a little closer, got the sharp order through her earpiece to stop. Looking past Arnie, she could see part of the line of hostages. And she saw Loo. So tall, Phoebe thought. All that gorgeous hair. Such a good shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll read it, Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see the rose, the rose she put in it.\" He was weeping. He was lost. \"Ask for a goddamn hostage, I do one. You understand me? Ask for another, I pick one and put one in the back of their head. You show it, you read it, you tell the goddamn world how you killed my angel. Then it\u0027s done. Then this is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath, his longing for it as much as his lover, vibrated in his voice. And he would take, she knew, fourteen people with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her gaze steady, she turned the book, flipped pages. \"She saved your rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m holding it up. I\u0027m doing what you want. I can\u0027t come closer, they\u0027re holding me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two steps forward. Everybody, two steps! Hold it up! Goddamn it.\" She shifted, turned the book only a fraction. In her mind she saw the red X\u0027s on the sketch. She saw him shove Loo\u0027s head to the left so he could get a better view. And meeting his eyes, just for an instant, she said, \"It\u0027s all I can do, Jerry. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the shot cut straight through her. She barely heard the screams, the shouts, the running feet that followed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Loo run out, on her own, and straight for her. The force of the embrace knocked Phoebe back two steps. \"Oh God, oh God, oh God. I thought I was going to die. I thought he\u0027d kill us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to get clear now, Loo. You have to move out of this area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved my life.\" She drew back, gripped Phoebe\u0027s face in her hands. \"You saved us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma Bee\u0027s over that way. You need to get clear, go to Ma Bee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved us all,\" Loo repeated as cops hustled up to pull her away. Phoebe dropped the book, turned. And there was Duncan pushing his way toward her. \"How did you get through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a laminated ID. \"I stole it.\" His arms came around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you. Still a bomb in there, right? Let\u0027s get the hell out of here, let\u0027s go home, let\u0027s go to Acapulco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but for now, let\u0027s just move far away from the building with the bomb inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your hand\u0027s shaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just my hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to sit down, Duncan. I have to find a quiet-quieter-place to sit down for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved through the aftermath with him, nodding, acknowledging those who congratulated her. Good job, nice work. Then she stopped short when Sergeant Meeks stepped into her path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing, simply looked at her. Then he inclined his head and strode away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He ought to be on his knees to you,\" Duncan muttered. \"Not his style, and I don\u0027t give a damn anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan led her back to the boutique, nudged her into a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe breathed out. \"Can you give me five here?\" she asked the rest of the team still inside. \"Five to clear my head, then we\u0027ll finish this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem, LT.\" Sykes jerked a thumb toward the door, paused on his way out. \"Hell of a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" And in the relative quiet, she breathed in again as Duncan crouched in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, you look like you could use a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could use several.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I happen to know an excellent pub.\" He lifted her hands, kissed them, then just buried his face in them. \"Phoebe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was never in any real danger. Not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell that to my guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so cold in here, she thought. How had it gotten so cold? Only her hands were warm, where he\u0027d kissed them. \"Duncan, I\u0027ve never discharged my weapon. I told you that. But I killed a man today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I gave the go on the kill shot. Not officially. But everyone involved knows I maneuvered him into position and gave the go. No choice. He was going to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He kept her hands gripped in his. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t find another way, so I\u0027ll live with it. I used the love he had for Angela to manipulate him. And I\u0027ll live with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked her up out of the chair, then sat with her cradled in his lap. \"It wasn\u0027t love. It was too selfish, too self-serving for that. And you know it. You were smarter than he was, that\u0027s what it comes down to. And you were braver at the heart of it. You stood out there, and he hid inside, behind innocent people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his face into her hair, pressed his lips to her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you sit here and feel sorry for him, or sorry for your damn self either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s telling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a hell of a woman here.\" He sat, wrapped around her, stroking the cold from her arms. \"When Mark D\u0027s back in business, we\u0027re going in there and picking out a ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t afford Mark D.\" But she managed a smile. \"I never thought about why they were in there, Ma Bee and Loo. I never thought about the why-I couldn\u0027t let it in. Oh Duncan, you were meeting them so they\u0027d help you pick out a ring for me. If you\u0027d gotten there before-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not thinking about that. I didn\u0027t, and everyone\u0027s out. Safe. That\u0027s the priority, isn\u0027t it, in your line of work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. And I have to do the rest of my job now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait. After you do that job, make sure you tell whoever you need to tell that you\u0027re taking the next three or four days off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My woman just saved the lives of seventeen people, so what are we going to do next? We\u0027re going to Disney World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t smile. She let out a quick, shocked sound that became a rolling laugh. \"Oh God, thank God I found you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found you,\" he corrected. \"I\u0027m a lucky guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arms around him, put her head on his shoulder. He gave her peace, and solid ground, and that shoulder to lean on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was damn lucky herself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-31.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
