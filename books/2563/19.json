They struggled together to get the door closed, but there were so many on the other side pushing against it. They knew we were inside, and they were hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApril ran into the hallway to wake up the children, making Jill take notice. She took a step in the direction of the hallway until Ms. Kay stepped around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Ms. Kay could react, Jill charged and tackled her to the floor. The old woman’s screams sent us all into a panic, but the only way out was up. Bob planted his feet on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go, Evan! I’ll hold the door, you go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Evan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, I grabbed Evan’s shirt and dragged him into the hallway, following April and her children up the stairs. Doris, Ashley, and Cooper were trailing behind. Bob yelled and then cried out in pain. His screams were matched by Ms. Kay’s, and quickly after, Barb’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter opened the door at the top of the stairs, and Cooper shut it behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” Skeeter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jill!” Doris cried. “And the back door is open! They’re all coming in!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter’s expression metamorphosed from confusion to determination. “The biters out front will follow the rest to the back. Y’all can get down off the roof and out of here. I’ve got to take care of Jill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooper grabbed Skeeter’s shirt. “The whole downstairs is full. You can’t go down there!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter furrowed his brow. “I made a promise to my wife. I’m going to keep it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryce opened the window, helping April and her kids to the roof while he spoke. “Skeeter, Coop’s right. Jill wouldn’t want you to get yourself killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter cocked his rifle. “My two favorite things—my wife and my guns—are downstairs, boys. I’m going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter opened the door and immediately started shooting his gun. Eric locked the door behind him, and Gary helped him to move a file cabinet in front of the door. What was left of Annabelle was lying on the floor beside the window. We all had to step over her to get outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Skeeter said, most of the dead ones had followed the rest to the back to get inside the church. Gary and Eric hopped down first, and Bryce and Cooper helped everyone off the roof before jumping down themselves. The whole process took less than a minute, and Skeeter’s rifle was still blasting inside the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had broken completely free of the horizon, and I watched the last living citizens of Fairview spread in different directions. My group jumped into the Bug and I drove away, my heart beating so fast it could have taken flight and beaten us to the ranch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Way way wait!” Bryce said, pointing to the oncoming lane. “Slow down!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything inside of me wanted to do the exact opposite, but I pressed my foot on the brake, next to a green pickup truck. A guy about our age was sitting inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled down my window. “What are you doing? This town is crawling with those things!” He didn’t respond. “Hey. Hey!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been bit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, and then leaned against his window to look down at the mess on the road. There was a girl in a hospital gown, skin and bones, lying on the street, a large bullet hole in her skull, parts of her brain spilled out onto the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled down his window, too. His eyes were swollen. He’d been crying, probably over the girl in the street. “I’m out of gas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around. We couldn’t leave him here to die. “Get in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy slowly kneeled on the floor to help Walter with his boots. He was sweaty from the near jogging he did on the return trip. She grunted each time she pulled, until she finally had them both off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter sat back in his chair. “Can I get a glass of water, dear? I’m parched.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Joy said, curious. “You look like you were chased back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoe watched us from the other side of the room, glancing out the sliding glass door once in a while. After Joy’s comment, Zoe’s eyes seemed to scan every blade of grass outside. The door looked over the patio, and into a room on the other side of the house. The bedroom opened to the backyard with a sliding glass door, too, but was concealed by the ugliest curtains I’d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Zoe. They’re all still on the highway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy sat two glasses of water on the kitchen table, and then she put her hands on her hips. “Well? I think we’ve been patient enough, right, Zoe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoe turned away from the glass just long enough to nod, and then returned to her watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter cleared his throat, and then gestured to our bags. “We got some supplies. It was getting late and sugar britches over there wouldn’t leave without his pantyhose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy frowned in confusion, and then waited for me to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re good for lots of things. I’m not going to wear them. Well, actually, I might, if it gets cold. Good insulation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy and Walter were content to watch me talk myself into humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I said. “I was a Boy Scout.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter laughed once. “And all this time they’ve been worried about the gays infiltrating their organization, and they’re teaching lulu things like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think my leader was a closet survivalist, too. I learned a lot from him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pantyhose?” Walter said in disbelief, his voice going up an octave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “You don’t worry about what you’re wearing if you’re warm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’ll be toasty all winter,” Joy said. Her expression immediately softened when she turned to Zoe. “Come on, peanut. I bet Princess is getting mighty hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoe nodded and followed her outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter and I moved to the front porch, sitting in the rocking chairs and discussing our next move. We decided we would try again for Jesse’s the next day. We also needed to fill the gas cans. Walter didn’t seem to be in a hurry, even though I reminded him we would be leaving before long. He pretended he didn’t hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e•••\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day we walked the distance to Jesse’s house. Walter was right; Jesse had more guns than Skeeter. We took as many as we could carry, along with the appropriate ammunition, and then made the trek back to Walter’s. We made that trip every day for three days. The basement began to look like an arsenal. I put several rifles and a few handguns in my car, reminding Walter again that Zoe and I weren’t staying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe days were beginning to get longer, and it panicked me when I had to think twice about what day it was. The only reason time mattered was to avoid getting caught outside at night. Weekends were irrelevant. Every day was about survival. Living with Walter and Joy, though, even with the occasional infected stumbling by, the apocalypse wasn’t so bad. Still, I had to take Zoe somewhere out of the way, and I still hadn’t carved out a quiet moment with Joy to see if she knew of a place we could settle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t believe me, do you?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter and I were watching an infected walk by. We’d learned over the last few days that if we stayed still and quiet, they kept walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter didn’t respond until the infected passed, and then he shook his head. “You need to get more sleep. You’re not making any damn sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to start making trips out of town. Scout the area. See if I can find some acreage with a house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a house right here, you fool,” Walter grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy occupied the space from the open front door, and looked over to Walter with a knowing smile. Walter shook his head so slightly that if he hadn’t paired it with a glance in my direction, I would have questioned whether I’d seen it. They were in disagreement about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy walked over to stand behind Walter, patted him reassuringly, and then spoke. “You asked about a place out of the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said. My posture straightened instinctively, eager to hear what she would say next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a doctor that comes to the store here sometimes. He buys things in bulk. I’ve only spoken to him once. He seems like a reasonable man, not what you might expect from a big city doctor. I know he has two girls, and he lives northeast of here. He’s several miles out, so it might be isolated enough to be safe for you and Zoe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter frowned at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would never force my way in, Walter. I hope you know that. I have to find the safest place to raise Zoe, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy smiled. “It’s not that. He likes having you two here. He doesn’t want you to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter crossed his arms over his chest and settled into his chair, unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this true?” Antagonizing Walter was probably not a good idea, but it was also too fun to pass up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go to hell.” He frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy let out a cackle, and she shook her head. “Oh, you stubborn man,” she said, rubbing his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter stood up quickly, his rifle in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI aimed at nothing in reaction. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter squinted over the rifle’s sights. “Kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had poured a bright light over us and everything else by the time we’d made the north turn on Highway 123. My hands were shaking, knowing we were that much closer to my dad’s ranch. I imagined his reaction when he saw the Bug pull into the yard, and what it would feel like for his arms to wrap around me, strong and warm. His cheeks wet from worried and happy tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t sure why I blamed him for the divorce. Mom was the one that had decided she didn’t want to be married to his profession anymore. It broke Dad’s heart when she said it was over, and for whatever reason my loyalties were with my mom. She seemed more fragile, and less capable to be on her own. I wasn’t sure what Dad could have done differently. Quit his job? Thrown away years of education? What else would he do? It wasn’t until I began my second semester of college that I realized it wasn’t just parties and friends. It was hours of studying and worrying and writing papers that would never pass through any other hands than a professor’s. But, I blamed him. I punished him with my absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled up in my eyes as I pressed on the brake to bring the Bug to a slow stop about a hundred yards from a large herd of dead ones. The car alarm confused me. It was grating to the ears, and yet I’d been so engulfed in my thoughts of my dad, the sound and even the headlights blinking on and off, visible through the dozens of ambling bodies, didn’t register until we were nearly on top of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want to do?” Bryce asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn off your lights,” the guy we’d picked up said, his voice tired and sad. He hadn’t told us his name, and no one had bothered to ask. We had more important things to worry about, I guess, but still it seemed strange. It was just another reminder that in just a few days the environment had changed us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days ago, Ashley would have been giggly and bubbly and the first thing she would have done is asked the guy his name. She didn’t even seem to notice he was in the car, even though she was half sitting on his lap, half Cooper’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up to turn the headlamp knob, and we idled. The wheat field on the right was still damp from rain. A vehicle had cut huge ruts into the soil, really deep in some spots. On the right was a grassy hill. I wondered for a moment why the person who made the ruts had chosen the wheat field. Then, the road leading into the tiny town of Shallot caught my eye. Ashley and I had passed this town and that wheat field so many times without a second thought. Now, the wheat field was dangerous, and the town a frightening unknown. The hill hid parts of the town from view, and the wheat field ruts led me to believe the person before us wanted as far away from that hill as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dashboard pinged, and I looked down. The gas gauge was a centimeter to the right of the red line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Ashley said. “How could we possibly star in a horror movie without something catalyzing like that happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Catalyzing?” Cooper said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” she replied, barely acknowledging his playful teasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was, Ashley had done significantly better on her SATs than I had. She’d always been a straight A student, even taking college courses in high school. She’d inherited our dad’s intelligence, but my mom’s inability to handle any amount of stress. She was an emotional ball of nerves and tears. Cooper once told me that his mother was the same way, and that’s why he was one of the few guys in school that didn’t find her high-maintenance. One late, drunken night when everyone else had passed out, Cooper shared with me that he actually found her neediness and constant need for assurance comforting, which was just . . . odd, and maybe a little co-dependent, but they were perfect for each other. Cooper understood Ashley, and made her happy like no one else could. They clung to each other because they believed it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know. I guess it was sweet. Even weird people deserved to be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well”—I breathed, hating what I was about to say—“look on the bright side. There is a gas station in Shallot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we’re so close,” Ashley said. “Let’s just drive around and go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t make it home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the dead ones seemed to notice the Bug, and she took a slow step toward us. She was young, and her long, blond hair might have been as beautiful as Ashley’s if it wasn’t ratted and covered in blood and . . . other things. Her movement drew the attention of another dead one, and then another. Soon, several were walking slowly but with purpose. Their eyes were milky and lifeless, but their mouths were open. Some of their upper lips were quivering, like a growling dog. The blonde reached out to me, and a low but excited moan pushed from her throat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-hill/page-19.html","bookId":2563,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 1:00:38 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 1:00:38 AM"}
