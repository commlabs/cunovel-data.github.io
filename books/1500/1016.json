If the clouds of radiation scattered, then the sunlight that passed through the window would shine into the living room, filling every corner with warmth. Helen carried a fine small kettle, focused on pouring boiling hot water into the teapot. Then, only after staring at it for a moment did she place the teawater into teacups, filling it with dark green liquid. The tea fragrance was fresh and long-lasting, truly embodying the essence of eastern tea art.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eOn the other side of Helen sat General Josh Morgan. He was clearly much thinner, but his mind was still sharp. When he looked at Helen, the old man’s expression also became much gentler. He raised a teacup, draining it in one gulp, and then, only after savoring the aftertaste for some time, did he reveal a smile of appreciation. With a deeply moved voice, he said, “It has already been more than ten years since I drank such an excellent cup of tea. Back then, when your mother was still in this world... “\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Don’t bring her up.” Helen tidied up this tea set with an expressionless face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eJosh Morgan stroked his beard in a somewhat awkward manner, and then after hesitation, he still said, “The events of the past, I really let her down, and I also let you down. Being able to watch you slowly grow up is something I am extremely grateful for…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“I do not feel grateful.” After Helen cleaned everything up, she sat down quietly, a machine-like expression appearing on her face. She said indifferently, “Moreover, many years have already passed, it is meaningless to say any more. Alright, now, you can tell me what important matter you have that you had to see me for. If there is no especially important matter, I do not wish to ever meet you again.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eGeneral Morgan rubbed his hands. This ‘Black Dragon’ who had previously led countless men was actually a bit uncomfortable. “Helen… actually, I don’t have anything that important, just…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003een\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e, I am going to leave for a period of time, so I fear that I won’t be able to take care of you anymore.

His hands clenched, and then loosened, sweat produced endlessly from his forehead. He felt as if he said something wrong, or maybe Helen already noticed something, so he wanted to remedy the situation, but couldn’t say anything after opening his mouth several times. In the end, it was still Helen who broke the silence, saying, “Are you going to look for the empress?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMorgan didn’t admit this, but his hands clenched together slightly, revealing his inner thoughts. He raised his head and looked into Helen’s eyes. Helen’s mechanical and precise beauty had never changed. Even if another hour passed, her expression would still be without any changes. That type of calm and formless pressure would accumulate with time. Morgan’s patience and willpower naturally weren’t limited to just an hour, but he understood Helen extremely well, also knowing that it was impossible to keep anything from her. Ever since she was young, Helen displayed a terrifying intelligence exceeding the human race. Now, it was even more difficult to measure; anything she spoke from her mouth already had absolute certainty, unless she didn’t plan on replying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eIn the end, Morgan revealed a bitter smile, and then said, “Correct, I am going to chase after Lanaxis, that is why…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen interrupted him, “Which is why you might never return, right? My judgment is that you definitely won’t be able to return.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMorgan was stunned. After a sigh, he said, “You are always just that smart, sometimes, it really makes you seem not cute.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen released an indifferent laugh, and then said, “The reason I am this smart, isn’t it because of your modifications?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe wrinkles on Morgan’s face became even deeper. “The events of the past…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“The things of the past have already happened, which is why they aren’t important, I won’t mind them too much either, I only brought it up to remind you. What I want to know is why do you need to fight a decisive battle against the empress? I don’t think you even have 1% of a chance.” Helen asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMorgan took a deep breath, and then said, “The end result might not necessarily be a decisive battle, I only… wish to see her condition, and then decide on what to do afterwards. Even if she has broken our past agreement, the situation is not completely irredeemable.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Why?” Helen didn’t calm down, nor did she diverge from her objective.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Because of this.” Morgan opened the old-fashioned leather suitcase by his feet, producing a metal box that wasn’t that large from within, placing it onto the coffee table. The metal box wasn’t large, nor was it heavy, to the extent where it even carried a bit of rust. What locked the box was an old-fashioned copper lock, any ability user with three levels of strength could twist it open without a key. However, Helen felt a type of strange yet familiar feeling, her heart rate instantly speeding up several times!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“What is this?” Helen’s face turned pale as she asked. She suppressed her crazily beating heart, body moving backwards, subconsciously wishing to increase the distance between herself and this metal box.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“This is a portion of the complete body, to be more precise, one-third of it.” Morgan said. Helen didn’t interrupt this time, instead waiting, because she knew General Morgan would definitely explain himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Before the great war, the federation already discovered the remains of a spaceship crash site, moreover establishing a series of top secret research projects from it, this is information you already know about.

In the specimen, the olden era scientists separated five different types of genomes. However, right when conclusion progress was about to be made on the specimen’s research, war erupted. To this day, no one knows why a global nuclear war would suddenly erupt. Meanwhile, after the Blood Parliament was established, we once again retrieved most of the projects’ materials, continuing the research.
