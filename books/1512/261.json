Since they were still in the unlocked mode, they could see the countless bees trying to get at them through the half dissipated smoke. Fortunately, the smoke could still delay them off a little longer and Kampa and WangXia were shooting at the bees from not far away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng ran toward the two of them like wind, reaching them in just a few seconds. He put down Xuan and stepped onto the Sky Stick. However, his body shook uncontrollably. The others then noticed his shoulder and leg were swollen and dark, as if the cells were dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa and WangXia both took out their knives. They looked at each other then Kampa stepped back a bit. WangXia sliced a cross shaped wound on Zheng\u0027s shoulder. Black colored blood flowed out along with an almond scent. Kampa and WangXia\u0027s expressions immediately turned terrible. Zheng stopped WangXia from trying to suck out the venom and said. \"Not an issue. I brought antidotes. Though I won\u0027t be able to control the Sky Stick.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan took his place and said. \"I unlocked the first stage of the constraint. I will control it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia sliced open the swollen areas on Zheng then instilled two syringes into the wounds. After the three of them stepped onto the ropes, Xuan took off with the Sky Stick. They flew along the smoke and broke through the layer of bees. Xuan was piloting the Sky Stick as good as Zheng. It flew without wavering a bit at maximum speed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Our speed is slightly slower than them.\" Xuan muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other three people turned their heads around and saw the bees flying after them. It was such a horrifying sight. If the sun was shining at that direction, the amount of bees would have completely blocked off the light. Even the dinosaurs wouldn’t stand a chance against these bees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa shouted then aimed the EMP rifle at the bees. The sound of the rifle was much louder than normal guns, plus the bullets generated a loud noise as they broke through the sonic barrier. The air in front of the gun barrel was wavering visibly. It was like looking through a fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Numerous bees got shot down by the bullets and dropped like rain. However, that was still such a small amount with respect to the whole species right here. The bees were still closing in. A a group of bees at the forefront came close to less than a kilometer, WangXia took out a timed bomb and adjusted the timer. Then he threw the bomb over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After flying away for a little bit, they heard the explosion. The blastwave reached them and broke the balance of the Sky Stick. Xuan immediately seized back control.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng asked curiously. \"This… isn\u0027t this too powerful? That\u0027s like three high explosive grenades.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A small mushroom cloud was still rolling up in mid air. All the bees caught in the explosion were dead and many nearby were shattered by the blastwave. This explosion nearly wiped the bees close to them. A still larger swarm was further away and wouldn\u0027t catch up for a while.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia laughed. \"Correct. That\u0027s the amount of explosives of three high explosive grenades. You can use it safely with some modification as long as you throw it far enough, or like how we were moving at a high enough speed. Otherwise, the blastwave alone would kill us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng let out a sigh of relief and patted WangXia\u0027s shoulder. His arm and leg had recovered by now. the antidotes were extremely effective plus his own recovery rate and immunization strength. He could basically start to fight again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng then said to Xuan in excitement. \"This is great! We obtained another quest item. Hurry, what\u0027s the use of this DNA restructuring document? Does that mean we can alter our DNA at will like the fourth stage?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan replied. \"Impossible. This is merely the formula for the potion to revert evolution and the DNA blueprint of some ancient species. It is useless to us but may be connected to the third bonus mission in this movie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other three were surprised. They only knew of two bonus missions. The second one being in Isla Nublar, even though they had no idea what happened there yet. So was there a third island?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan continued. \"Zheng, have you noticed that we didn\u0027t receive a time constraint in this world? Which means we can stay in this world for ten years or more if we don\u0027t come to Isla Sorna to complete the mission.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng paused for a moment, then said in a surprise. \"You\u0027re right. There\u0027s no time constraint this time. So can that mean we spend time training here? My qi and blood energy is improving slowly but if there\u0027s a lot of time…\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not possible. Although I did consider of this possibility. Do you know why I decided to come to this island so soon? I was suspicious of why would God leave such a big exploit. Our mission is very simple since we only have to steal the T-Rex eggs from the museum so why didn\u0027t God give us a time limit? The only possibility is we will be in danger if we stay in the city or this world for too long.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan continued slowly. \"Have you noticed the closer we got to the center of the island, the more insects we saw. It wasn\u0027t just the bees. There were several other insect species and some had bigger numbers than the bees and larger bodies. Know what this signifies? They are still evolving to adapt to the oxygen level of this world. The bees have obviously adapted. Once the other species finished adaptation, they will begin to reproduce. The end result can only be the annihilation of human society. That\u0027s why the longer we stay here, the lower the chance we will survive. In five years, the insects will be all over the world and we won\u0027t be able to obtain the T-Rex eggs. That will be the consequence of living peacefully for those years. Danger equals rewards. And time will be that reward.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng finally got it and said. \"So the third bonus mission only appears after finishing the first mission. We have to fully understand the potential threat of these insects and the significance of this document to complete it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Correct. Handing over this document to the government of this world in order to change the fate of humanity. This is the meaning of the bonus mission and will change the original plot.\" Xuan adjusted his glasses and said calmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-12-chapter-5-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-12-chapter-6-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-12-chapter-5-03","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
