Preda, where in the Errant’s name did they all go?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled. ‘Kick that mage nest of yours, Letur Anict. Make them earn their exorbitant fees. The king needs to know. Every detail. Everything.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘At once,’ the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she would do the same with the Ceda’s squad of acolytes. The redundancy was necessary. Without the presence of Kuru Qan’s chosen students, she would never learn all that Letur Anict held back on his final report, would never be able to distil the truths from the half-truths, the outright lies. A perennial problem with hiring private contractors-they had their own interests, after all, and loyalty to the crown was, for creatures like Letur Anict, the new Factor of Drene, always secondary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began looking for a way down onto the beach. Bivatt wanted a closer look at these canoes, especially since it seemed that sections of their prows had been dismantled. Which is an odd thing to do. Yet, a manageable mystery, one I can deal with and so not think about all the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Upwards of a half’million.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrant’s blessing, who is now among us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Awl’dan, following the Edur conquest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves had come, then gone, and where corpses had been dragged out from the solid press atop the hilltop-where the unknown soldiers had made their last stand-the signs of their feeding were evident, and this detail remained with the lone rider as he walked his horse amidst the motionless, sprawled bodies. Such pillaging of the dead was… unusual. The dun-furred wolves of this plain were as opportunistic as any other predator on the Awl’dan, of course. Even so, long experience with humans should have sent the beasts fleeing at the first sour scent, even if it was commingled with that of spilled blood. What, then, had drawn them to this silent battlefield?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lone rider, face hidden behind a crimson scaled mask, drew rein near the base of the low hill. His horse was dying, racked with shivers; before the day’s end the man would be walking. As he was breaking camp this dawn, a horn-nosed snake had nipped the horse as it fed on a tuft of sliver-stem grasses at the edge of a gully. The poison was slow but inevitable, and could not be neutralized by any of the herbs and medicines the man carried. The loss was regrettable but not disastrous, since he had not been travelling in haste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavens circled overhead, yet none descended-nor had his arrival stirred them from this feast; indeed, it had been the sight of them, wheeling above this hill, that had guided him to this place. Their cries were infrequent, strangely muted, almost plaintive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Drene legions had taken away their dead, leaving naught but their victims to feed the grasses of the plain. The morning’s frost still mapped glistening patterns on death-dark skin, but the melt had already begun, and it seemed to him that these dead soldiers now wept, from stilled faces, from open eyes, from mortal wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising on his stirrups, he scanned the horizon-as much of it as he could see-seeking sight of his two companions, but the dread creatures had yet to return from their hunt, and he wondered if they had found a new, more inviting trail somewhere to the west-the Letherii soldiers of Drene, marching triumphant and glutted back to their city. If so, then there would be slaughter on this day. The notion of vengeance, however, was incidental. His companions were indifferent to such sentiments. They killed for pleasure, as far as he could tell. Thus, the annihilation of the Drene, and any vengeance that could be ascribed to the deed existed only in his own mind. The distinction was important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, a satisfying conceit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, these victims here were strangers, these soldiers in their grey and black uniforms. Stripped now of weapons and armour, standards taken as trophies, their presence here in the Awl’dan-in the heart of the rider’s homeland-was perturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the invading Letherii, after all. The numerous legions with their peculiar names and fierce rivalries; he knew as well the fearless cavalry of the Bluerose. And the still-free kingdoms and territories bordering the Awl’dan, the rival D’rhasilhani, the Keryn, the Bolkando Kingdom and the Saphinand State-he had treated with or crossed blades with them all, years ago, and none were as these soldiers here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePale-skinned, hair the colour of straw or red as rust. Eyes of blue or grey. And… so many women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze settled upon one such soldier, a woman near the hill’s summit. Mangled by sorcery, her armour melded with the twisted flesh-there were sigils visible on that armour…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDismounting, he ascended the slope, picking his way round bodies, moccasins skidding on blood-soaked mud, until lie crouched down at her side. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-5.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
