Why couldn’t you go see if some of them have something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they aren’t you,” said Grand Miss Lei cleverly. “It’s because you aren’t someone else that we selected you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does me having something wrong or not have anything to do with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because our Young Master 9th took a liking to you, and wants to marry you,” said Grand Mistress Lei. “So of course I had to take a good close look at you. People with problems cannot marry into the Dragon Family.” [1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang finally understood.

Good and kind-hearted. Why would he bully people?” Her voice was filled with love. “Even if sometimes it seems like he’s bullying others, it’s not a big problem.” Then her voice grew hard. “But if he wants to do some bullying, so be it. We’ll just pretend we don’t know. And if he tries to, but fails, we will step in to help out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang listened, shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t understand how someone could say such preposterous things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As of now,” said Grand Miss Lei, “I know you have no defects, so you are qualified to marry him. Of course I should congratulate you.” Then she asked, “Now do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still don’t understand?” said Grand Miss Lei, shocked. “Are you an idiot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not an idiot,” said Tang Lanfang. “But I’m old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not the least bit old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m at least ten years older than him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” she said, sounding both very open-minded and also very earnest. “Married couples and friends are the same. As long as they both are happy, what does a bit of difference in age have to do with anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Lanfang gaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never heard anyone say such things before, nor had she ever dared to think about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet now, she was forced to. Her heart started to beat, quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she heard the voice of the old man coming from outside: “Can I come in now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dare!” cried Grand Miss Lei angrily. “If you dare to come in, I’ll dig out your eyeballs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to heave a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Miss Lei muttered curses: “Old pervert.” As she cursed, she put Tang Lanfang\u0027s clothes back on.

And what she wore was even more gaudy than any grand miss would put on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore makeup on her gaunt face, and a large red flower was stuck into the white hair on her temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTan Lanfang had never seen people as laughable as this. And yet she didn’t laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the old man laughed. Looked at her and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know why my wife just said what she did?” he asked her. “Why she said that an age difference shouldn’t matter between married couples?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly answered his own question, apparently afraid his wife would forbid him from saying it: “Because she’s a dozen or so years older than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTan Lanfang felt it was all very strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was strange was not what he had said, but the fact that after he said it, he didn’t receive a slap in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only did Grand Miss Lei not seem inclined to do anything, she actually looked at her husband with a warm, meaningful glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was born in the year of the sheep,” she said, “and he always assumed I was too. That would make me twelve years older than him. Except, I was actually born in the year of the tiger, which makes me nineteen years older than him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thought I didn’t know?” said the old man with a loud laugh. “You thought you could trick me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I knew,” said the old man, looking immensely pleased. “I knew even before we got married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did you ask me to marry you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I love you,” the old man told his wife, his eyes filled with sweet, tender affection. “Even though you’re seventeen years older than me, I still wanted to marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did I ever lie to you?” he said with a wink. “If I ever did, it was only because I didn’t want you to get angry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Miss Lei chuckled, a laugh that truly sounded like a grand miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, you’re not allowed to lie to me,” she said, her face suddenly very serious. “After you married me, did you regret it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I regret it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not only am I older than you, I’m fierce and rude and get jealous easily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re fierce because you want the best for me. You get jealous because you love me, and you’re worried I’ll go after a younger woman. If you didn’t love me, I could go chase eight hundred women, get on my knees and beg you to get jealous, but you wouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly clasped his wife’s hand, just like a young man clasping the hand of his first love. “Let me ask you, after all these years, would you say our lives have been happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Miss Lei nodded her head quietly. “Every day since the day we got married has been very happy. If God could let me live them all again, I would still marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe then turned her head and looked at Tang Lanfang: “I bet you think we are sickeningly amusing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Lanfang didn’t respond. She didn’t need to. She was sure that they could see how she felt. Right now, if anyone said they were sickeningly amusing, she would slap them across the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, she had thought this couple to be laughable, but now she just wanted to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a person who had been stuck in a dark room for a very long time, and then suddenly saw the bright sunny sky, green mountains and trees, red flowers and spacious land, tears streamed from her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re crying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not crying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re obviously shedding tears.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shedding tears isn’t necessarily crying,” said Tang Lanfang. “And crying isn’t necessarily shedding tears.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should think an old granny like me, made up like a little girl, is quite laughable. Why are you crying instead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” said Tang Lanfang. “I really don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, she did know, she just didn’t want to say. So the old man said it for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you believe yourself to be young, who would dare call you old?” he said to his wife. “If you believe yourself to be old, you can dress yourself up however you wish, and no one will think it laughable.” He continued: “The determining factor in being old is not one’s age, but rather one’s heart. Therefore, some people who are eighteen years old are already old, but some people who have lived to eighty are still quite young.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Miss Lei laughed, then lightly pinched Tan Lanfang’s cheek. “If I’m not old, then how can you dare to call yourself old? Come! We must go back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go back?” asked Tan Lanfang. “Go back where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back to your little clown!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed her to leave, but Tan Lanfang, her face growing red, said, “Wait a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something else I want to ask you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he wants to marry me, but do I want to marry him?” she asked, her face scarlet. “Regardless of anything, you should at least ask me first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to muster a lot of bravery to say this. And yet, to Grand Miss Lei this question didn’t seem to even count as a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you want to,” she said. “Who knows how many women want to marry a talented young man like him.

Was he worried about her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man had been looking at her this whole time, laughing to himself, as if he could see into her heart. He suddenly said, “Don’t worry, he won’t run off. Even if someone tried to beat him away with a broom, he wouldn’t leave. I know that he loves you, and he’ll wait for you to come back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Lanfang ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man continued to mess with her. Deliberately, he asked, “You know who the ‘he’ I’m talking about is, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeliberately, she responded, “No, I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really don’t know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well then I’ll just have to tell you,” he said with a wink. “I’m talking about that clown, your future husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTan Lanfang’s face grew red, and the old man clapped his hands, laughing. He laughed so hard it seemed as if his one remaining tooth might fall out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Miss Lei also looked quite happy. Even the big red flower in her white hair seemed to be laughing happily. Tang Lanfang wanted to be angry, but just couldn’t make herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen life is so wonderful, what reason would they have to be upset? What justification to be angry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they were happy. Because they had no idea what had happened to Ingot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if someone told them, they probably wouldn’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened to Ingot, even he himself could scarcely believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1] And finally here is the connection to 7 Killers!!!
