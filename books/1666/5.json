Mel’s mom was inconsolable. The two had their moments, like any mother and daughter, but the woman’s heart had been broken. When I’d hung up, I was sure my swollen eyes couldn’t shed any more tears, but I was wrong. I hadn’t told Mel’s mom what I had seen or what Mel had told me. At that moment, it didn’t seem like the right thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal news had spotty information on the explosion. Was it a freak accident?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrorist attack? A hit on Mel? The latter was difficult to believe, and even I found it hard to swallow, but I had been there. I had known how scared Mel had been and I had seen that…that thing take out her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no mention of the senator’s sons or what I had told the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday, I found myself looking through old albums of Mel and I. The pictures made me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd cry again. The photos of us in high school together were pretty telling. Mel had grown into this tall reed—runway model thin—and her blue eyes were vibrant against her tan skin and dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was absolutely stunning with her megawatt smile, and when we’d been teenagers, she had entertained the idea of modeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could’ve done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pictures of me weren’t as glamorous. I’d stopped growing in the ninth grade, something Mel had always teased me about. My blond hair was long and wavy in a perpetually messy way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Mel had a flawless complexion and a rocking body, in high school I had freckles and hips that came out of nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlipping through the pictures had eased some of the pressure in my chest. Mel wouldn’t be forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my memories, but would there ever be justice for her? I doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened seemed like something straight out of a science fiction movie. Even if my eyes hadn’t been playing tricks on me, if the senator’s sons were behind what happened to Mel, I knew it would be swept under the rug. Who was Mel compared to the political elite?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger festered inside me like a rotten wound, had me replaying the events over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Thursday I received a brief call letting me know I could retrieve my car, but there was no other news as to who was responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. I didn’t know what to think about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter calling a cab, I changed into a pair of jeans and a shirt. Knots formed in my belly as I climbed into the back of the taxi. When I gave him instructions to the garage, my voice shook. A huge part of me didn’t want to go back there, but it wasn’t like I could buy a new car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe normally congested streets of downtown Boulder were relatively clear. It took no amount of time to be dropped off at the entrance of the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there, clutching my purse to my chest like some sort of shield. The yellow crime scene tape flapped listlessly in the slight breeze. I inhaled, and maybe it was my imagination, but I still could smell burned metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral moments passed before I forced my legs forward, my car keys already in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntering the parking garage was no easy feat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overhead lights had been replaced, but I could still see them exploding, showering sparks like the sparklers Mel and I had played with as kids. And how could the officers explain that? The lights had blown before the explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny goose bumps covered my arms. It was cooler in the garage, but I knew that wasn’t the reason. Being here…my throat closed with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself to look ahead, not at where Mel’s car had been. Go straight to my car, get in, and get the hell out of there, but I was standing before the spot Mel’s car had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pavement had been scorched, as were the metal beams above it. Like someone had laid down black tar. I was no fire expert, but it seemed strange that either side of the marked cement was untouched. There wasn’t even a spot of singed floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could a bomb be that controlled?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid question because I knew it wasn’t a bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to continue walking. There were a few cars left in the garage. None of them suffered any damage. Not even the ones in the row behind where Mel’s had been parked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway to my lonely car when another chill skated across my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrible feeling of déjà vu washed over me, no doubt a product of the traumatic events. After all, I was standing in the exact same place I had been Monday night when I first saw the man. Though this feeling was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was expecting someone to step out or call my name. I felt watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasting a quick glance around, I saw that I was alone. No one was stalking me in the shadows. I was overreacting—totally understandable. But the chill wouldn’t go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding, I dashed the rest of the way to my car, my flip-flops smacking off the cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathless, I pressed the unlock button on the keypad as I skidded to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my fingers wrapped around the handle, all I could think of was that once I was in my car, it better start, and when it did I was never coming here again. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked open the door and twisted to slide in, eyes darting over the shadowy, empty garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was out of control, pumping blood through my veins way too fast. Was I having a panic attack? I had one before, the day I’d found out about Mom, but I’d never experienced such chaotic emotions since. Forcing myself to take several long and deep breaths, I tossed my bag on the passenger seat as I cast one more look around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when I saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least a shadow shaped like a man leaning against a beam no more than five parking spaces away from me. No one had been there seconds ago. I would have seen the hulking shadow and heard the footsteps in the tomb-silent garage… unless I was officially the most unobservant person in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught as my fingers tightened on the car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow was so dark and so deep it seemed to be its own black hole, sucking the light out of everything around it, and then it broke apart from the darkness, gliding forward. My heart dropped and I forced myself to blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t a shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very tall man strode forward, his ass-kicking boots thudding with each fluid, predatory step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow nowhere near as obnoxiously loud as my flip-flops had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step back. Every instinct fired warnings off left and right, but I was rooted to the cement, unable to move as the stranger prowled forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn’t walk. Oh no. He moved like a giant jungle cat stalking its prey, and I had never felt more like prey in my life than I did at that moment. The man was ridiculously tall, reaching at least six and a half feet, which was like Bigfoot size to my five-and-a-half-foot demeanor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he came closer, I understood why I’d thought he was a shadow at first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed in snug black leather pants and a plain black tee shirt that was stretched taut over broad shoulders and well-defined upper arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Lord in heaven. I could see ropey muscles of his stomach under that shirt, flexing across his midsection with each step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bet my savings account that man had a rock-hard six pack. Mouth dry, I lifted my lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords couldn’t even describe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was pale—not ghastly white or sickly, but alabaster against the mess of wavy hair so black it held a tint of blue to it, like raven wings. A strong chin and carved jaw made complete by broad cheekbones. He had to be in his late twenties, maybe early thirties. Full, sensual lips were turned up on one corner, as if he knew some private joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something exotic about the way his face pieced together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was the slight tilt to the outer corners of his eyes, or the fact that I’d never, ever seen anyone who looked like him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reminded me of one of those male models on the cover of vampire romances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could’ve easily been any number of them except… “Miss Cross?” His voice was like whiskey, deep and smooth, but there was something about the hard line of his jaw that said the man didn’t smile a lot. Two eyes such a pale blue they seemed to lack color stared back into mine. The thick and sooty lashes framing those startling eyes made them appear even more unnaturally pale. For a moment I wondered if he was blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were raw—beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I realized then that I was staring at him and he was…he was smirking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped out of it, bristling. “Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne single brow rose. “Is that typically how you greet people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was usually indecently polite. Oddly, my heart hadn’t slowed even though I no longer really detected imminent danger. “Do you usually sneak up on women in a parking garage —?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—that someone was blown up in a few short days ago?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a sharp breath at the harsh reminder of what had occurred. “Excuse me,” I said, turning toward my car before I burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man sighed loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I meant is that you had a point. I should’ve said something earlier. You have been through a very…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trailed off as I stared at him. A confused look marred his striking face, as if he was mentally going through a word list but couldn’t find the right thing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms, waited for what I felt was an acceptable time limit, and finally ran out of patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Traumatic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStressful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpsetting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded. “Yeah, those things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows furrowed as my lips puckered. “What can I help you with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Hunter. I’m with the Department of Defense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Department of Defense? Why are they involved? I mean, I know what I saw was some—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Let’s not talk about what you saw.” He folded his arms, stretching the material of his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze dropped over him again. Strange attire for the Department of Defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, casting my eyes to where his forearms crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeez, this guy must have a wicked workout regimen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you with those officers I spoke to Monday night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If one of them acted like he was constipated, then yes, I’m with Officer Zombro and Richards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips started to loosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes, one of them did look uncomfortable…” I peeked up and found him watching me with eerie pale eyes. “I thought they were with Homeland Security?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what they said?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t an answer, but as I waited for more detail, I realized that was all I was going to get. “Do you have a last name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you here to ask questions about what happened?” I asked, my palms starting to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething wasn’t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression remained the same. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking it was time to ask for some sort of identification, but before I could, Hunter stepped forward, crowding me. My back hit the side of the car and there was nowhere else for me to go. My heart tripped up as I inhaled sharply. The scent of masculine spice and soap swamped me. “Then why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head to the side as his pale eyes drifted around me before settling back on my face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-5.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
