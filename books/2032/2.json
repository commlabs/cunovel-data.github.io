{"id":108710,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe police had found Stefan\u0027s abandoned car by Old Creek Road. That meant he\u0027d left it somewhere between Drowning Creek and the woods. Elena stumbled on the overgrown path through the graveyard, but she kept moving, head down, arms hugging her light sweater to her. She had known this graveyard all her life, and she could find her way through it blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she crossed the bridge, her shivering had become painful. It wasn\u0027t snowing as hard now, but the wind was even worse. It cut through her clothes as if they were made of tissue paper, and took her breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan, she thought, and turned onto Old Creek Road, trudging northward. She didn\u0027t believe what Damon had said. If Stefan were dead she wouldknow. He was alive, somewhere, and she had to find him. He could be anywhere out in this swirling whiteness; he could be hurt, freezing. Dimly, Elena sensed that she was no longer rational. All her thoughts had narrowed down to one single idea. Stefan. Find Stefan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was getting harder to keep to the road. On her right were oak trees, on her left, the swift waters of Drowning Creek. She staggered and slowed. The wind didn\u0027t seem quite so bad any more, but she did feel very tired. She needed to sit down and rest, just for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she sank down beside the road, she suddenly realized how silly she had been to go out searching for Stefan. Stefan would come to her. All she needed to do was sit here and wait. He was probably coming right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena shut her eyes and leaned her head against her drawn-up knees. She felt much warmer now. Her mind drifted and she saw Stefan, saw him smile at her. His arms around her were strong and secure, and she relaxed against him, glad to let go of fear and tension. She was home. She-was where she belonged. Stefan would never let anything hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, instead of holding her, Stefan was shaking her. He was ruining the beautiful tranquility of her rest. She saw his face, pale and urgent, his green eyes dark with pain. She tried to tell him to be still, but he wouldn\u0027t listen.Elena, get up , he said, and she felt the compelling force of those green eyes willing her to do it.Elena, get up now -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, get up!\" The voice was high and thin and frightened. \"Come on, Elena! Get up! We can\u0027t carry you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking, Elena brought a face into focus. It was small and heart-shaped, with fair, almost translucent skin, framed by masses of soft red curls. Wide brown eyes, with snowflakes caught in the lashes, stared worriedly into hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie,\" she said slowly. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helping me look for you,\" said a second, lower voice on Elena\u0027s other side. She turned slightly to see elegantly arched eyebrows and an olive complexion. Meredith\u0027s dark eyes, usually so ironic, were worried now, too. \"Stand up, Elena, unless you want to become an ice princess for real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have been warmer inside the car, but Elena\u0027s nerve endings were coming back to life, making her shake, telling her how cold she really was. Winter is an unforgiving season, she thought as Meredith drove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on, Elena?\" said Bonnie from the back seat. \"What did you think you were doing, running away from school like that? And how could you come out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena hesitated, then shook her head. She wanted nothing more than to tell Bonnie and Meredith everything. To tell them the whole terrifying story about Stefan and Damon and what had really happened last night to Mr. Tanner - and about after. But she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if they would believe her, it wasn\u0027t her secret to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone\u0027s out looking for you,\" Meredith said. \"The whole school\u0027s upset, and your aunt was nearly frantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" said Elena dully, trying to stop her violent shivering. They turned onto Maple Street and pulled up to her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judith was waiting inside with heated blankets. \"I knew if they found you, you\u0027d be half-frozen,\" she said in a determinedly cheerful voice as she reached for Elena. \"Snow on the day after Halloween! I can hardly believe it. Where did you girls find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On Old Creek Road, past the bridge,\" said Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judith\u0027s thin face lost color. \"Near the graveyard? Where the attacks were? Elena, howcould you?...\" Her voice trailed off as she looked at Elena. \"We won\u0027t say anything more about it right now,\" she said, trying to regain her cheerful manner. \"Let\u0027s get you out of those wet clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go back once I\u0027m dry,\" said Elena. Her brain was working again, and one thing was clear: she hadn\u0027t really seen Stefan out there; it had been a dream. Stefan was still missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to do nothing of the kind,\" said Robert, Aunt Judith\u0027s fianc��\u0026amp;brvbar;. Elena had scarcely noticed him standing off to one side until then. But his tone brooked no argument. \"The police are looking for Stefan; you leave them to their job,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police think he killed Mr. Tanner. But he didn\u0027t. You know that, don\u0027t you?\" As Aunt Judith pulled her sodden outer sweater off, Elena looked from one face to another for help, but they were all the same. \"Youknow he didn\u0027t do it,\" she repeated, almost desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. \"Elena,\" Meredith said at last, \"no one wants to think he did. But - well, it looks bad, his running away like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t run away. He didn\u0027t! Hedidn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, hush,\" said Aunt Judith. \"Don\u0027t get yourself worked up. I think you must be getting sick. It was so cold out there, and you got only a few hours of sleep last night...\" She laid a hand on Elena\u0027s cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sick,\" she cried, pulling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m not crazy, either - whatever you think. Stefan didn\u0027t run away and he didn\u0027t kill Mr. Tanner, and I don\u0027t care if none of you believes me...\" She stopped, choking. Aunt Judith was fussing around her, hurrying her upstairs, and she let herself be hurried. But she wouldn\u0027t go to bed when Aunt Judith suggested she must be tired. Instead, once she had warmed up, she sat on the living room couch by the fireplace, with blankets heaped around her. The phone rang all afternoon, and she heard Aunt Judith talking to friends, neighbors, the school. She assured all of them that Elena was fine. The... the tragedy last night had unsettled her a bit, that was all, and she seemed a little feverish. But she\u0027d be good as new after a rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith and Bonnie sat beside her. \"Do you want to talk?\" Meredith said in a low voice. Elena shook her head, staring into the fire. They were all against her. And Aunt Judith was wrong; she wasn\u0027t fine. She wouldn\u0027t be fine until Stefan was found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt stopped by, snow dusting his blond hair and his dark blue parka. As he entered the room, Elena looked up at him hopefully. Yesterday Matt had helped save Stefan, when the rest of the school had wanted to lynch him. But today he returned her hopeful look with one of sober regret, and the concern in his blue eyes was only for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disappointment was unbearable. \"What are you doing here?\" Elena demanded. \"Keeping your promise to \u0027take care of me\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flicker of hurt in his eyes. But Matt\u0027s voice was level. \"That\u0027s part of it, maybe. But I\u0027d try to take care of you anyway, no matter what I promised. I\u0027ve been worried about you. Listen, Elena - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in no mood to listen to anyone. \"Well, I\u0027m just fine, thank you. Ask anybody here. So you can stop worrying. Besides, I don\u0027t see why you should keep a promise to amurderer. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Matt looked at Meredith and Bonnie. Then he shook his head helplessly. \"You\u0027re not being fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was in no mood to be fair either. \"I told you, you can stop worrying about me, and about my business. I\u0027m fine, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe implication was obvious. Matt turned to the door just as Aunt Judith appeared with sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I\u0027ve got to go,\" he muttered, hurrying to the door. He left without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith and Bonnie and Aunt Judith and Robert tried to make conversation while they ate an early supper by the fire. Elena couldn\u0027t eat and wouldn\u0027t talk. The only one who wasn\u0027t miserable was Elena\u0027s little sister, Margaret. With four-year-old optimism, she cuddled up to Elena and offered her some of her Halloween candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena hugged her sister hard, her face pressed into Margaret\u0027s white-blond hair for a moment. If Stefan could have called her or gotten a message to her, he would have done it by now. Nothing in the world would have stopped him, unless he were badly hurt, or trapped somewhere, or...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Stefan was in trouble, and she had to find him somehow. She worried about it all through the evening, desperately trying to come up with a plan. One thing was clear; she was on her own. She couldn\u0027t trust anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grew dark. Elena shifted on the couch and forced a yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tired,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe I am sick after all. I think I\u0027ll go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith was looking at her keenly. \"I was just thinking, Miss Gilbert,\" she said, turning to Aunt Judith, \"that maybe Bonnie and I should stay the night. To keep Elena company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a good idea,\" said Aunt Judith, pleased. \"As long as your parents don\u0027t mind, I\u0027d be glad to have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long drive back to Herron. I think I\u0027ll stay, too,\" Robert said. \"I can just stretch out on the couch here.\" Aunt Judith protested that there were plenty of guest bedrooms upstairs, but Robert was adamant. The couch would do just fine for him, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter looking once from the couch to the hall where the front door stood plainly in view, Elena sat stonily. They\u0027d planned this between them, or at least they were all in on it now. They were making sure she didn\u0027t leave the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she emerged from the bathroom a little while later, wrapped in her red silk kimono, she found Meredith and Bonnie sitting on her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hello, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,\" she said bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie, who had been looking depressed, now looked alarmed. She glanced at Meredith doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows who we are. She means she thinks we\u0027re spies for her aunt,\" Meredith interpreted. \"Elena, you should realize that isn\u0027t so. Can\u0027t you trust us at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Can I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, because we\u0027re yourfriends. \" Before Elena could move, Meredith jumped off the bed and shut the door. Then she turned to face Elena. \"Now, for once in your life, listen to me, you little idiot. It\u0027s true we don\u0027t know what to think about Stefan. But, don\u0027t you see, that\u0027s your own fault. Ever since you and he got together, you\u0027ve been shutting us out. Things have been happening that you haven\u0027t told us about. At least you haven\u0027t told us the whole story. But in spite of that, in spite of everything, we still trust you. We still care about you. We\u0027re still behind you, Elena, and we want to help. And if you can\u0027t see that, then youare an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Elena looked from Meredith\u0027s dark, intense face to Bonnie\u0027s pale one. Bonnie nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" she said, blinking hard as if to keep back tears. \"Even if you don\u0027t like us, we still like you. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena felt her own eyes fill and her stern expression crumple. Then Bonnie was off the bed, and they were all hugging, and Elena found she couldn\u0027t help the tears that slid down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yangtze?\" Bonnie\u0027s eyes widened. \"But why would he want to kill a dog?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but he was there that night, in your house. And he was... angry. I\u0027m sorry, Bonnie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie shook her head dazedly. Meredith said, \"Why don\u0027t you tell the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s laugh was slightly hysterical. \"I can\u0027t. It\u0027s not something they can deal with. And that\u0027s another thing I can\u0027t explain. You said you still trusted me; well, you\u0027ll just have to trust me about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie and Meredith looked at each other, then at the bedspread, where Elena\u0027s nervous fingers were picking a thread out of the embroidery. Finally Meredith said, \"All right. What can we do to help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Nothing, unless...\" Elena stopped and looked at Bonnie. \"Unless,\" she said, in a changed voice, \"you can help me find Stefan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s brown eyes were genuinely bewildered. \"Me? But what can I do?\" Then, at Meredith\u0027s indrawn breath, she said, \"Oh.Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew where I was that day I went to the cemetery,\" said Elena. \"And you even predicted Stefan\u0027s coming to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you didn\u0027t believe in all that psychic stuff,\" said Bonnie weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve learned a thing or two since then. Anyway, I\u0027m willing to believeanything if it\u0027ll help find Stefan. If there\u0027s any chance at all it will help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie was hunching up, as if trying to make her already tiny form as small as possible. \"Elena, you don\u0027t understand,\" she said wretchedly. \"I\u0027m not trained; it\u0027s not something I can control. And - and it\u0027s not a game, not any more. The more you use those powers, the more they useyou. Eventually they can end up using you all the time, whether you want it or not. It\u0027sdangerous. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena got up and walked to the cherry wood dresser, looking down at it without seeing it. At last she turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right; it\u0027s not a game. And I believe you about how dangerous it can be. But it\u0027s not a game for Stefan, either. Bonnie, I think he\u0027s out there, somewhere, terribly hurt. And there\u0027s nobody to help him; nobody\u0027s even looking for him, except his enemies. He may be dying right now. He - he may even be...\" Her throat closed. She bowed her head over the dresser and made herself take a deep breath, trying to steady herself. When she looked up, she saw Meredith was looking at Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie straightened her shoulders, sitting up as tall as she could. Her chin lifted and her mouth set. And in her normally soft brown eyes, a grim light shone as they met Elena\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe match rasped and threw sparks in the darkness, and then the candle flame burned strong and bright. It lent a golden glow to Bonnie\u0027s pale face as she bent over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to need both of you to help me focus,\" she said. \"Look into the flame, and think about Stefan. Picture him in your mind. No matter what happens, keep on looking at the flame. And whatever you do, don\u0027t say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena nodded, and then the only sound in the room was soft breathing. The flame flickered and danced, throwing patterns of light over the three girls sitting cross-legged around it. Bonnie, eyes closed, was breathing deeply and slowly, like someone drifting into sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan, thought Elena, gazing into the flame, trying to pour all her will into the thought. She created him in her mind, using all her senses, conjuring him to her. The roughness of his woolen sweater under her cheek, the smell of his leather jacket, the strength of his arms around her. Oh, Stefan...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s lashes fluttered and her breathing quickened, like a sleeper having a bad dream. Elena resolutely kept her eyes on the flame, but when Bonnie broke the silence a chill went up her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first it was just a moan, the sound of someone in pain. Then, as Bonnie tossed her head, breath coming in short bursts, it became words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone...\" she said, and stopped. Elena\u0027s nails bit into her hand. \"Alone... in the dark,\" said Bonnie. Her voice was distant and tortured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another silence, and then Bonnie began to speak quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dark and cold. And I\u0027m alone. There\u0027s something behind me... jagged and hard. Rocks. They used to hurt - but not now. I\u0027m numb now, from the cold. So cold...\" Bonnie twisted, as if trying to get away from something, and then she laughed, a dreadful laugh almost like a sob. \"That\u0027s... funny. I never thought I\u0027d want to see the sun so much. But it\u0027s always dark here. And cold. Water up to my neck, like ice. That\u0027s funny, too. Water everywhere - and me dying of thirst. So thirsty... hurts...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena felt something tighten around her heart. Bonnie was inside Stefan\u0027s thoughts, and who knew what she might discover there? Stefan, tell us where you are, she thought desperately. Look around; tell me what you see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\"Thirsty. I need... life?\" Bonnie\u0027s voice was doubtful, as if not sure how to translate some concept. \"I\u0027m weak. He said I\u0027ll always be the weak one. He\u0027s strong... a killer. But that\u0027s what I am, too. I killed Katherine; maybe I deserve to die. Why not just let go?...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" said Elena before she could stop herself. In that instant, she forgot everything but Stefan\u0027s pain. \"Stefan - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena!\" Meredith cried sharply at the same time. But Bonnie\u0027s head fell forward, the flow of words cut off. Horrified, Elena realized what she had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie, are you all right? Can you find him again? I didn\u0027t mean to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s head lifted. Her eyes were open now, but they looked at neither the candle nor Elena. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena,\" the voice said, \"don\u0027t go to the bridge. It\u0027s Death, Elena. Your death is waiting there.\" Then Bonnie slumped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena grabbed her shoulders and shook. \"Bonnie!\" she almost screamed. \"Bonnie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... oh, don\u0027t. Let go.\" Bonnie\u0027s voice was weak and shaken, but it was her own. Still bent over, she put a hand to her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so... yes. But it was so strange.\" Her tone sharpened and she looked up, blinking. \"What was that, Elena, about being a killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember everything. I can\u0027t describe it; it was awful. But what did that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" said Elena. \"He\u0027s hallucinating, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith broke in. \"He? Then you really think she tuned in to Stefan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena nodded, her eyes sore and burning as she looked away. \"Yes. I think that was Stefan. It had to be. And I think she even told us where he is. Under Wickery Bridge, in the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-2.html","bookId":2032,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:47 PM"}
