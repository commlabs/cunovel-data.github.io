Mandarb barely stirred. The animal was growing accustomed to such strikes. The High Guard gathered, and Andere took up Lan’s banner, affixing it in the socket on his saddle so that he could carry it, but still swing a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir orders arrived from Agelmar. Lan and his men would be in the very thick of the attack. Once the Trollocs charged, the heavy cavalry would hit the flanks to break up their momentum. Lan and his men would hit the creatures face-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lan preferred it. Agelmar knew better than to try to coddle him. Lan and his troops would hold the center ground before the hills, forcing the Trollocs to fight in such a way that the archers could lob volley after volley into their back ranks. Harrying forces would be held mostly in reserve, to prevent the enemy sweeping around their right flank; the river was on their left, a natural deterrent to the Trollocs. A good plan, if any plan could be considered a good one in the face of such overwhelming odds. Still, Agelmar was not making mistakes that Lan could see. He complained of troubled dreams lately, but considering the war they fought, Lan would have been more worried if the man hadn’t dreamed of death and battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs started to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forward!\" Lan called as the trumpets sounded in the air, accompanied by thunder from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short distance from the walls of Cairhien, Elayne rode Moonshadow along the front lines; the army had formed up according to Bashere’s battle plans, but she was worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had done it. A fast march upriver along the road to arrive at Cairhien in front of the Trolloc army. Elayne had positioned their force on the far northern side of Cairhien to face the Trolloc army coming in from that direction. She had also left some of the dragons and a company of bowmen downriver to deter the Trollocs trying to cross the river there; they would withdraw quickly northward when it became impossible to prevent the enemy from crossing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeat the army ahead; then face the one behind. It was their only chance. The Kinswomen were exhausted; Elayne had required many gateways to move her men. Their fatigue meant Elayne would have no channelers in this fight. The women would be hard-pressed to make small gateways to Mayene to deliver the wounded for Healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne’s army was slightly larger than that of the Shadowspawn, but her men were exhausted. Amid the anxiety of a coming battle, some slumped in their lines, pikes tipping forward. Those who stood firm had reddened eyes nonetheless. They still had Aludra’s dragons. That would have to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne hadn’t slept the night before. She’d spent the time searching for inspiring words, seeking something she could say this day that would have meaning. What did you say when all was coming to an end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe halted Moonshadow at the front of the line of Andoran soldiers. Her words would be relayed, using weaves, to the entire army. Elayne was surprised to see that some of the Aiel were drawing close to listen. She wouldn’t have thought they’d care about the words of a wetlander queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to speak, and the sun went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne froze, looking upward with shock. The clouds had parted above them—they often did when she was near, one way the bond with Rand manifested—and so she’d been expecting an open sky and light for this battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun still shone up there, but occluded. Something solid and dark rolled in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll across her army, men looked up, raising fingers as they were swallowed by darkness. Light! It was hard to keep from trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard cries through the army. Lamentations, worries, cries of despair. Elayne gathered her confidence and kicked her horse forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the place\", she announced, enhancing her voice with the One Power to project across the field, \"where I promise you we will win. This is where I tell you that days will continue, that the land will recover. This is the time when I promise you that the light will return, that hope will survive, that we will continue to live\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused. Behind the army, people lined the top of Cairhien’s city walls: children, women, and the elderly who were armed with kitchen knives and pots to throw down, should the Trollocs destroy the army and come for the city. There had barely been time to contact them; a skeleton force of soldiers guarded the city. Now, their distant figures huddled down as darkness ate the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose walls offered a false safety; they meant little when the enemy had Dreadlords. She needed to defeat the Trolloc army quickly, not hide and allow them to be reinforced by the larger force to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am supposed to reassure you\", Elayne shouted to the men. \"But I cannot! I will not tell you that the land will survive, that the Light will prevail. Doing so would remove responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is our duty! Our blood that will be spilled this day. We have come here to fight. If we do not, then the land will die! The Light will fall to the Shadow. This is not a day for empty promises. Our blood! Our blood is the fire within us. Today, our blood must drive us to defeat the Shadow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her horse. The men had looked away from the darkness above, toward her. She wove a light, high in the sky above her, drawing their attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our blood is our passion\", she shouted. \"Too much of what I hear from my armies is about resistance. We cannot merely resist! We must show them our anger, our fury, at what they have done. We must not resist. Today, we must destroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our blood is our land. This place is ours, and we claim it! For our fathers and mothers, for our children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our blood is our life. We have come to give it. Across the world, other armies are pushed back. We will not retreat. Our task is to spend our blood, to die advancing. We will not remain still, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we are to have the Light again, we must make it ours! We must reclaim it and cast out the Shadow! He seeks to make you despair, to win this battle before it begins. We will not give him that satisfaction! We will destroy this army before us, then destroy the one behind. And from there, we bring our blood—our life, our fire, our passion—to the others who fight. From there it spreads to victory and the Light!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe honestly didn’t know what kind of response to expect from a battlefield speech. She’d read all of the great ones, particularly those given by queens of Andor. When younger, she’d imagined the soldiers clapping and shouting—the response given to a g \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-149.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:33 PM"}
