{"id":73255,"no":85,"title":"Page 85","content":"\u003cp\u003eTen sighed and ordered us all a new round of Long Island Iced Teas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling miserable for Quinn, I opened my mouth and blurted out the first thing to come to my head. “If you could be powerful or honest, which would you choose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t you be both?” Ten asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn, however, mulled the question over before admitting, “Honest. It seems like you have to be meaner when you’re powerful. I don’t want to be mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “So, then...if you had to choose between nice or honest...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d choose nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile bloomed across my face. “You believe in lying in order to keep from hurting someone, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, but didn’t seem to question why I was asking him this stuff. Heck, I wasn’t even sure why I was. I just wanted to talk. To him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” he admitted. “I just can’t handle hurting anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I murmured thoughtfully. “Me neither.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s about the point where I totally lost track of the conversation. The two Long-Island-Iced-Tea drunkards at the table with me started talking about all kinds of shit I didn’t follow, and yet they knew exactly what they were raving about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know the corneas are the only cells in the human body that don’t receive blood from the heart?” Hamilton told Blondie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puckered her lips thoughtfully. “Does that mean the heart can’t see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned and realized their happy juice had definitely kicked in, especially when Blondie giggled and then swayed as she clutched her forehead. “Whoa. I’m getting woozy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHamilton grabbed her arm to steady her. “I know,” he slurred and glanced my way. “This shit is potent. I feel...” He nodded slowly. “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my eyebrows, wondering if he was drunk or high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlondie giggled again and pointed at him. “I’ve never heard you cuss before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t,” Hamilton said blankly before Blondie charged, “But you just said shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and pointed back at her. “So did you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they giggled together, I rolled my eyes to the ceiling. Oh, dear God. Someone shoot me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why I was always so scared to drink,” Quinn announced. “My mom used to get so mad when she drank. That’s when she’d beat me the hardest. So I always thought I’d lose my temper too if I ever drank. But I don’t feel mad at all. I’m just...happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gut twisted as I listened to him so nonchalantly announce something like that. I’d seen his back before, so I knew he had to have been beaten once upon a time. I just figured school bullies though, or someone else he hadn’t been related to. To learn it had been his own mother, the one woman who was supposed to protect him from all kinds of bad shit, made me want to look that bitch up and beat her. It also made me want to call my own mom and tell her how fucking awesome she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’d been too long since I’d voluntarily called her, so...yeah, didn’t want to give the old broad a heart attack or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just starting to feel shitty about how I treated my parents while they might possibly be the best parents in the world when Blondie had to go and say, “My dad didn’t need alcohol to hit me. So, I don’t know why I was always so scared to drink. I guess I’m just an overall coward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes grew wide with that little piece of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, shit. Both of them had been abused? No wonder they’d turned out so much alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, I really was an ungrateful asshole to my mom and dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not a coward,” Quinn insisted, taking Blondie’s hand. “You’re...you’re...resilient.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted, wondering how the fuck “resilient” was such a complimentary word to use on a chick, but hey...to each their own, I guess, because the freaking word seemed to work on Blondie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe murmured, “Thank you,” and stared at him with a pair of longing green eyes that made me want to reach across the table and thump Hamilton on the back of the head. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrime opportunity to kiss her, I wanted to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiss her already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy wasn’t he kissing her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, what a pansy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of kissing, they just kept staring until Ham blinked and then grinned. “Staring contest?” he offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear fuck. Really?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned and covered my face. I was going to have to work on my boy, big time. Who the hell offered a staring contest instead of kissing a girl? I might actually have to defriend him after tonight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-85.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
