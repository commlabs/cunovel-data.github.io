(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Master Yun Li walked slowly towards Zhou Weiqing’s desk, he saw the words written on the sign, and a look of scorn and disgust appeared in his expression. Lifting his hands, the air seemed to twist and ripple, and the sign was actually torn into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Shangguan Bing’er cried out angrily, but was held back by Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked at Yun Li lazily, and Yun Li said coldly: “I could not care less whether or not you want to gather Followers here, but do not insult the name of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. How old are you? Are you even twenty? You dare claim you are a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Claim? Have you even tested the fact?” Yun Li scoffed disdainfully, turning to leave, as if speaking to Zhou Weiqing was an insult to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed and said loudly: “So you’re just a braggart who talks loudly but has no real ability.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Li turned back savagely, a cold light in his eyes. Around his right hands, four pure Dragonstone Jade Physical Jewels appeared, denoting his Attribute of Agility, just like Shangguan Bing’er. As for his left hand, he did not hide his Elemental Jewels, it was naturally four Gold-Green Cat’s Eye Spatial Jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Brat, what did you call me a useless braggart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing twisted his mouth and said: “Yes, I did. You’re just a High Level Consolidating Equipment Master, yet you’re so arrogant, who do you think you are?” [1. Okay, I made up the whole back part. This is one insult which I didn’t really the context of. He literally said ‘When you go out, close the door properly, don’t show something that you aren’t supposed to show. What is this?’ - Which didn’t make sense to me. If someone gets it, do let me know in the comments and I’ll change it.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Li’s right hand lifted up swiftly like a bolt of lightning, as if wanting to take action, but he forcibly stopped himself. With a deadly cold in his eyes, he snarled: “If this wasn’t in the Trading Centre where we aren’t allowed to take action, I would have made you pay for your words. If you dare, come out with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said challengingly: “Why? You can’t rebut my words and you want to kill me off instead? To think you call yourself a Consolidating Equipment Master. If you dare, let’s compete with our Consolidating Equipment Master skills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing his words, Yun Li calmed down instead, saying solemnly: “How do you want to compete?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “I’ll come up with the competition. If I lose, I do not need you to take action, I will commit suicide. If you lose, I want you to become my Lifetime Follower. I’m using my life to bet against your freedom. My Consolidating Equipment Master rank is lower than yours, it isn’t a stretch for me to be the one to come up with the competition right? Of course, if you do not dare, you can just get lost, and stop acting like a big shot in front of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bro Yun Li, calm down, do not fall for his tricks.” The boss of shop 76, Zhou Changxi, had arrived beside Yun Li, whispering to him in caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Li waved his hands, stopping Zhou Changxi. He was extremely confident in his own abilities as a Consolidating Equipment Master. After all, he had the name of the youngest High Level Consolidating Equipment Master, and it had boosted his confidence to the peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright, I will bet with you. As long as it is a competition to do with Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, I will accept it.” Although Yun Li was rash, he was no fool, ensuring that Zhou Weiqing could only come up with a competition regarding Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. In his eyes, even if Zhou Weiqing was really a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, he would still not be able to compete with him in this regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Alright, in that case, I won’t take advantage of you as well. We should compete in three different competitions, and whoever wins two will win it all. I will come up with the first two competitions, and you will come up with the last one, that is fair right? Everyone around here shall be our witnesses. I believe that with Master Yun Li’s status, he will keep his word right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Li gave a cold humph and said: “I agree, you can come up with the first competition now. Just do not be too afraid to commit suicide later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was just about to open his mouth, but was suddenly stopped by the worried Shangguan Bing’er. “Little Fatty, how can you bet your life with him… you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s face changed and he said angrily: “When men are speaking, why are you interrupting, move aside.” As he said that, he gave Bing’er a signal with his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite that, Shangguan Bing’er was still uneasy, and wanted to continue saying something, but Zhou Weiqing had already spoken out on the first competition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old Bro Yun Li, I am a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, while you are a High Level one. As such, let’s compete on creating a set of Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, Yun Li thought that Zhou Weiqing would give some weird problem, and didn’t expect such a normal competition. As such, he couldn’t help but feel that victory was going to be easy, and gave a cold humph before saying: “Fine, as you wish. How about this, as long as you prove that you are a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, even if you lose, I do not want your death. Let’s change it to the same bet, you will become my Lifetime Follower, lest anyone says I am taking advantage of you.” He had calmed down a little, and if Zhou Weiqing was really a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, it would be much more beneficial for him to have him as a Follower than to kill him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still sneering scornfully in his heart, after all creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls quickly was his speciality, after all he was an Agility Physical Jewel master. Adding to the fact he was of a higher rank, he could not see any possibility that he would lose this first competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Yun Li say that, Shangguan Bing’er relaxed a little, finally giving up the notion of stopping Zhou Weiqing. Although she knew in her heart that Zhou Weiqing would not bet his life without absolute confidence, she was still extremely nervous. Now that she heard Yun Li say that he wouldn’t take Zhou Weiqing’s life, she finally calmed down and would no longer try to convince him. From Zhou Weiqing’s trademark smile on his face, she could tell that he had some sneaky plan up his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing turned towards Qin Feng and said: “Big Bro Qin, could you please prepare the required Consolidating Paper and materials for Consolidating Ink? I will create it myself later, and I’ll pay for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Feng laughed heartily and said: “That small amount of money isn’t anything, our Shop 77 will provide the materials for free.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one had to pick the happiest person in the entire area, it would definitely be Qin Feng. No matter who ultimately won the competition, it had no great effect on him. However, this bet between two Consolidating Equipment Masters would naturally draw a huge crowd, and his shop 77 would naturally benefit from the attention as well. With that increase in business to look forward to, it was an easy decision to just provide some free materials. Naturally, Zhou Changxi would not lose to him, and also provided Yun Li with free materials as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a matter of minutes, Yun Li’s table had been moved over, and both sat down facing each other. Without further words, both took out a sheet of Consolidating Paper, and started their designing a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe design that Zhou Weiqing drew was the bow he had made for Kou Rui yesterday. That bow was modified from his Overlord Bow, removing the socket, reducing some power and draw. The Overlord Bow was a Grandmaster level Consolidating Equipment Scroll, and even after modification, it was still one of the more complicated ones amongst Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-7-chapter-55-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-7-chapter-56-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-7-chapter-56-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
