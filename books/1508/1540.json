The Purple Temple Dao Palace was one of the nine great Dao Palaces of the human body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe function of this Dao Palace was to condense the power of the stars from the highest heavens. In a short period of time, it would allow the intensity of Lin Ming’s astral essence to rise by a dramatic degree! This sort of increase could be by three to four times, or even eight to nine times!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe exact number was determined by the foundation of the martial artist as well as the completeness of their Dao Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was because the origin of the Purple Temple Dao Palace’s strength didn’t come from a martial artist’s body but from starlight in the highest heavens. Thus, even if it increased strength by several times it still wouldn’t overdraw a martial artist’s potential; this was the advantage of the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn comparison, the Gate of Life’s blood essence was to burn a martial artist’s blood vitality. If one burned too much it would damage a martial artist’s life source and would reach unrecoverable levels.
