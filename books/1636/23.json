He flicked his MA5B assault rifle to full auto and shot. Linda combined her fire and they dropped the Jackals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last four Jackals charged Fred and Linda—plasma pistols firing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda made a fist and pumped it once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred nodded and he faded back behind the hull, leaving a primed grenade on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reloaded, waited two heartbeats, and then twin blasts shuddered through the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred moved up and shot the wounded Jackals struggling to rise off the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked for another target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone but the Spartans stood. The cavernous shuttle bay of the Covenant destroyer was empty save mangled and bloodied corpses of Jackals and Grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred pointed at Linda and then to the nukes on the ship. They had to get those things defused. She nodded and moved toward the FENRIS warheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred strode to a set of pressure doors and the nearby control panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree Spartans couldn\u0027t take a Covenant ship; not under normal circumstances, but Blue Team had three advantages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst they had the element of surprise. What Covenant captain would dream three humans might board and capture their ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, Blue Team had been on an enemy warship before; they knew the basic layout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd last, and most important, the Covenant were slow to change. While their technology was centuries ahead of the most advanced the USNC could muster, it had become more dogma than science. They didn\u0027t innovate; they imitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainly they knew about the capture of the Ascendant Justice by John. If that had happened to a UNSC ship, there would have been new security protocols enacted on every ship in the fleet to prevent it from ever happening again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred was betting their lives that the Covenant didn\u0027t think like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe retrieved the ONI datapad, newly updated with Covenant translation software, and set it upon the control panel. Purple lights flickered on the panel near the pad as the pad\u0027s network-infiltration programs booted… and it slipped into the Covenant ship\u0027s system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in. Just like having Cortana around… without the chatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred searched intership messages and found an alert: the team unloading the nukes was overdo to report. A Brute team had been sent to see what was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill and Linda took cover inside the dropship\u0027s cockpit. Fred wished he could join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey powered up the ship. It lifted, turned, and backed into the far corner to protect the nukes from the next phase of his plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred returned to the datapad. He had little time before the entire ship was alerted to the invading army of three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrolled through ship systems and found the icon he needed: an arrow encircling twin dots. Pressurized molecular oxygen. John had shown them that one. Fred overrode the ship\u0027s self-seal bulkheads—jammed them open. Every pressure door he secured—ajar. The ONI hackware churned as it stripped away security protocols. He primed the ship\u0027s life pods and froze their air-lock hydraulics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed his red, amber, and green status lights to give Will and Linda a countdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the green winked off, Fred gripped a handle on the wall and clutched the datapad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the amber light dimmed he slaved the controls for the energy shield on the shuttle bay, the emergency life-pod releases, and the air-lock overrides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn red… he punched the master release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA drum roll of thumps pounded the destroyer\u0027s hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shuttle bay\u0027s energy shield vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hurricane pulled at Fred, blew out cargo pods, bodies, tools, small repair ships, and the bodies of Jackals and Grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clung to the handle; one side of the metal bar bent and pulled free, but then the tremendous gale subsided. All the air had evacuated into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred rechecked his atmospheric reserves. They had been in combat and on the COE for a long time where no one was taking tiny breaths. His MJOLNIR suit had seven minutes of air left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to the datapad and checked: all corridors and rooms read zero pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless there were Covenant forces in pressure suits, this ship was a ghost ship now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill and Linda joined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred routed power and the doors slid apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Team entered the hallway and quickly made their way toward the bridge. Six dead Brutes lay on the floor. For all their ferocity, even they had to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred halted at another set of pressure doors and accessed the control panels. Linda knelt by his side, sniper rifle butted to her shoulder, aimed at the center of the doors. Will stood on the opposite side, a grenade in each hand, ready to throw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred touched his helmet to the bulkhead, and listened, boosting his aural sensors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then keyed the doors open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oval bridge was empty save for a single Covenant Hunter who miraculously clung to the railing of the command console. Inside the monster\u0027s eight-centimeter-thick armor, its body, composed of a colony of eel creatures, had oozed out and freeze dried onto the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three Spartans checked the life-pod hatches for any sign of the enemy. Fred saw the open space beyond, stars… and the other Covenant destroyer turning toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved onto the command platform and set the datapad in the interface location. Fred had to hurry; he had to move slow, too. Rushing now might cause errors that could cost them more time. It took all he had to focus on language matrices, numbers, and icons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill watched from a life-pod hatch, and whispered over TEAMCOM, \"Destroyer on intercept vector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred accessed the datapad\u0027s memory and got the Slipspace jump solution provided by a NAV Officer on Cairo Station. He hoped the Covenant ship would accept the human mathematics or they\u0027d be stuck here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda joined Will by the open hatch, peering through her Oracle sniper scope. \"Ten thousand kilometers and closing fast,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arm FENRIS warheads,\" Fred told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was where the luck part of their plan would be stretched to its thinnest. Had the Covenant shuttled the now-active warheads onto their ships? Would they notice the detonators had been primed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confirmation signal lock,\" Linda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, come on,\" Fred whispered to the datapad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe command surfaces lit and holographic geometries drifted over its surface. A tiny version of the console appeared on his datapad with English translations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred grabbed the spherical Slipspace command and rotated it. Its ready status winked ultramarine. He input the jump coordinates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere then froze, and a white vector stretched toward tiny stars that appeared over the command surface. A blinking gold starburst appeared to initiate the Slipspace transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two-second countdown,\" he told Linda, \"on my mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill pulled the hydraulics from the open hatch, grasped the door, and rolled it back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge\u0027s main holographic viewer flickered on and showed the closing destroyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarning indicators pointed to the ships\u0027 heating lateral plasma lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two-second timer confirmed,\" Linda said. \"Commands accepted and confirmed. All six FENRIS nukes show armed status.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark!\" Fred tapped the jump button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened… Black space turned white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Hood watched from the command deck of Cairo Station, ignoring the warbling emergency signals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant destroyer had maneuvered to optimal plasma range. He hoped the shields of the Spartan-captured ship staved off at least one salvo, and gave Blue Team the time they needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpartan-104\u0027s plan had been inspired, yet in Lord Hood\u0027s seasoned opinion, suicidal. Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine Halsey had once told him in confidence that Spartans considered it their duty to prove the impossible possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant ship\u0027s plasma lines reddened, bolts formed, and launched. At the same time, the enemy destroyer flashed inside their energy shields; its hull glowed and vaporized as the stolen nuclear devices onboard detonated. A circle of white light appeared an instant before Cairo Station\u0027s polarization shields cut the viewscreens. Thermal and radiologicals showed smears of amber and red mushrooming outward in a wavering torus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStation Wayward Rest had been obliterated as well. The length of the Tallo Negro del Maiz crumpled and fell to the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of the Spartan-held ship. There was no way to know if they had succeeded and jumped into Slipstream space or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Hood chose to believe they had done the impossible anti whispered, \"Godspeed, Blue Team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1440 HOURS, NOVEMBER 3, 2552 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ ABOARD THE CAPTURED COVENANT DESTROYER BLOODIED SPIRIT, IN SLIPSTREAM SPACE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred sat on the bridge deck of Bloodied Spirit, breathing air tinged with the scent of Hunter blood. It smeiled like burnt plastic to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe polished a tiny quantum mirror and set it back into its sensor housing. This he slipped into the pauldron of his MJOLNIR armor and clicked the cover. The mirror had been encrusted with sea salt, causing his motion sensor to fail… and almost costing him his life back on Havana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda passed a canteen to Fred and sloshed its contents to get his attention. He accepted it, opened his faceplate, and enjoyed a taste of nonrecycled water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere the three of them on this ship the last Spartans? Fred wondered if John was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr Kelly. There was no mention of Kelly in Dr. Halsey\u0027s communique. And what had ever happened to Gray Team on a mission far outside the confines of UNSC space, now missing for over a year? He would never voice these worries. It might sap Blue Team\u0027s morale. But for the first time, real doubt eroded Fred\u0027s confidence. Doubt that John, Kelly, and the others were alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda touched his arm with a finger and dispersed these thoughts. She then patted the bullet-shaped nuclear warhead on the floor next to him. \"Remember? The rebel base?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d brought one of the FENRIS warheads up here in case they needed a final option. Fred didn\u0027t think they would need it… but it was best to cover all contingencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What insurgent base?\" Will asked, rolling over and waking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was twenty years ago,\" Fred explained. \"Rebels in the Tauri System claimed they had nukes to trade. Blue Team was sent in to recover the warheads, but it turned out to be a trap.\" He shook his head. \"Would have worked too, if it hadn\u0027t been for Kurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda took the canteen and hoisted it. \"To absent friends,\" she whispered and sipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed the canteen to Will, who drank deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red octahedral flashed over the Covenant command console. It projected amber beams onto the surface and the holographic geometries shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans dropped their faceplates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred moved to the console, overrode the controls, but they reverted, seeming to have a mind of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere there Covenant still alive on this ship, attempting to regain control?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranslations scrolled across his datapad: \"BLOODIED SPIRIT AUTOMATED…SYSTEM ACTIVATED…TO BATTLE SOUNDED…HEED THE CALL TO WAR…WARNING…SLIPSPACE ANOMALY…DIMENSION YED-4 DETECTED…CAUSE: SINGULARITY AFTERMATH.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble,\" he told Linda and Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda bounded to the weapons station and her hands moved over the surface. \"Making plasma lines hot,\" she said. \"I think. Laser capacitors charging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill stood at the NAV station. \"We\u0027re approximately sixteen light-years from Onyx,\" he said. \"No stellar systems or other significant bodies in the region. The Slipspace matrix is decon-voluting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred tapped a hexagon—the Slipstream space matrix reinitialization command. It blinked once and faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re entering normal space,\" he said. \"Stand ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStars winked on in the bridge\u0027s holographic viewer along with four Covenant ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree smaller ships gave chase to one larger. The small ones were two-thirds the tonnage of Bloodied Spirit. The larger ship was twice their size. The vessels\u0027 sleek outlines made Fred think of sharks hunting a whale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLances of plasma flashed from the three and shimmered as they impacted on the larger ship\u0027s shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we dropped out of Slipspace because of some anomaly,\" Fred said. \"Or… in response to a distress signal. I\u0027m not sure which.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what ship?\" Linda asked. \"Which one do we target first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe central holographic viewer faded and a Brute materialized standing before them with blue-gray skin, a gorilla head, and red feral eyes. He spoke in a series of grunts and hisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA translation popped on Fred\u0027s datapad: \"Brothers, the schism is here. We are free at last to crush the lesser races. We will no longer be led by—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brute looked about the bridge, blinked, and then glared at Fred. It hissed and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the translation pad a single word had appeared: \"Demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the smaller ships turned toward them. Ultramarine spheres flashed over Linda\u0027s weapon console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s targeting us,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That answers that,\" Fred muttered. \"Target the smaller ships. Will, get me a best-guess Slipspace transition vector to Onyx.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred had no intention of engaging in ship-to-ship combat. He was no captain. He\u0027d be out of his depth if this were a UNSC ship with controls he could understand, and astrogation, tactics, and weapon systems he was familiar with. On Bloodied Spirit, he couldn\u0027t begin to fathom how to fight. Running was the only realistic option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working on a solution,\" Will said. He glanced back and forth between the printed crib sheet of translated symbols and the Covenant mathematics that flashed before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time on target calculated,\" Linda announced. \"Ready to fire plasma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just buy us time,\" Fred told her. \"We\u0027re not moving to engage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Covenant frigate now in weapons range,\" Linda said. \"Plasma lines heating.

The translucent spheres centered on the plasma shots and overlapped Bloodied Spirit. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-23.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
