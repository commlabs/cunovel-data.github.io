We don\u0027t want it confiscated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh I am glad I\u0027m not on duty,\" muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. \"I wouldn\u0027t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they\u0027ve got to stop celebrating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum\u0027s more spectacular moves. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint....Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like....Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman\u0027s voice echoed throughout the stadium, \"I give you....Potter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep - his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams - all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up! Ron - Harry - come on now, get up, this is urgent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027S\u0027 matter?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite had changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of people running. He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, \"No time, Harry - just grab a jacket and get outside - quickly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them....They didn\u0027t seem to have faces....Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air. Two of the figures were very small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled. Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand. Several caught fire. The screaming grew louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s sick,\" Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. \"That is really sick....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys\u0027 tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to help the Ministry!\" Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. \"You lot - get into the woods, and stick together. I\u0027ll come and fetch you when we\u0027ve sorted this out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon,\" said Fred, grabbing Ginny\u0027s hand and starting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished. Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air. Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her. \"Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid - lumos!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tripped over a tree root,\" he said angrily, getting to his feet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, with feet that size, hard not to,\" said a drawling voice from behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Language, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. \"Hadn\u0027t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn\u0027t like her spotted, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" said Hermione defiantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Granger, they\u0027re after Muggles, \"said Malfoy. \"D\u0027you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around....they\u0027re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione\u0027s a witch,\" Harry snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have it your own way, Potter,\" said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. \"If you think they can\u0027t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You watch your mouth!\" shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that \"Mudblood\" was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind, Ron,\" said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron\u0027s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scare easily, don\u0027t they?\" he said lazily. \"I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What\u0027s he up to - trying to rescue the Muggles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027re your parents?\" said Harry, his temper rising. \"Out there wearing masks, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...if they were, I wouldn\u0027t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh come on,\" said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, \"let\u0027s go and find the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,\" sneered Malfoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!\" said Ron hotly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!\" said Hermione fervently. \"Oh I can\u0027t believe this. Where have the others got to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, \"O¨¹ est Madame Maxime? Nous l\u0027avons perdue -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er - what?\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...\" The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, \"\u0027Ogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beauxbatons,\" muttered Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must go to Beauxbatons,\" said Hermione. \"You know...Beauxbatons Academy of Magic....I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...yeah...right,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred and George can\u0027t have gone that far,\" said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione\u0027s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand - but it wasn\u0027t there. The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, no, I don\u0027t believe it...I\u0027ve lost my wand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s back in the tent,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?\" Hermione suggested anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"maybe...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is bad wizards about!\" she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running. \"People high - high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up with her?\" said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. \"Why can\u0027t she run properly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bet she didn\u0027t ask permission to hide,\" said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn\u0027t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"It\u0027s slavery, that\u0027s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he\u0027s got her bewitched so she can\u0027t even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn\u0027t anyone do something about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the elves are happy, aren\u0027t they?\" Ron said. \"You heard old Winky back at the match...\u0027House-elves is not supposed to have fun\u0027...that\u0027s what she likes, being bossed around....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s people like you, Ron,\" Hermione began hotly, \"who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they\u0027re too lazy to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just keep moving, shall we?\" said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\" one of them shouted. \"I\u0027m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not!\" yelled his friend. \"You\u0027re a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron...but I\u0027m a vampire hunter, I\u0027ve killed about ninety so far -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \"I\u0027m about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron\u0027s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \"Did I tell you I\u0027ve invented a broomstick that\u0027ll reach Jupiter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly!\" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We\u0027ll hear anyone coming a mile off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?\" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \"What are you doing in here, all alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at one another, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - there\u0027s a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBagman stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the campsite...some people have got hold of a family of Muggles....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBagman swore loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \"The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope the others are okay,\" said Hermione after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be fine,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\" said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \"He\u0027s always said he\u0027d like to get something on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d wipe the smirk off old Draco\u0027s face, all right,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those poor Muggles, though,\" said Hermione nervously. \"What if they can\u0027t get them down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will,\" said Ron reassuringly. \"They\u0027ll find a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic\u0027s out here tonight!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they\u0027ve been drinking, or are they just -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" called Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MORSMORDRE!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry\u0027s eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the -?\" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn\u0027t understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn\u0027t see anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" he called again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, come on, move!\" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the Dark Mark, Harry!\" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could. \"You-Know-Who\u0027s sign!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voldemort\u0027s - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of them started across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout pausing to think, he yelled, \"DUCK!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"STUPEFY!\" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards\u0027 wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That\u0027s my son!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron - Harry\" - his voice sounded shaky - \"Hermione - are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of the way, Arthur,\" said a cold, curt voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch\u0027s face was taut with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which of you did it?\" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. \"Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t do that!\" said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t do anything!\" said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. \"What did you want to attack us for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not lie, sir!\" shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping - he looked slightly mad. \"You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barty,\" whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, \"they\u0027re kids, Barty, they\u0027d never have been able to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did the Mark come from, you three?\" said Mr. Weasley quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over there,\" said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. \"There was someone behind the trees...they shouted words - an incantation -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stood over there, did they?\" said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. \"Said an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione\u0027s words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re too late,\" said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head. \"They\u0027ll have Disapparated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric\u0027s father. \"Our Stunners went right through those trees....There\u0027s a good chance we got them....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos, be careful!\" said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! We got them! There\u0027s someone here! Unconscious! It\u0027s - but - blimey...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got someone?\" shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving. \"Who? Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This - cannot - be,\" he said jerkily. \"No -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found Winky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No point, Mr. Crouch,\" Mr. Diggory called after him. \"There\u0027s no one else there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bit embarrassing,\" Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky\u0027s unconscious form. \"Barty Crouch\u0027s house-elf....I mean to say...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come off it, Amos,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly, \"you don\u0027t seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark\u0027s a wizard\u0027s sign. It requires a wand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Mr. Diggory, \"and she had a wand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Mr. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, look.\" Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley. \"Had it in her hand. So that\u0027s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a start. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald-green skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dark Mark!\" he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues. \"Who did it? Did you get them? Barry! What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been, Barty?\" said Bagman. \"Why weren\u0027t you at the match? Your elf was saving you a seat too - gulping gargoyles!\" Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet. \"What happened to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been busy, Ludo,\" said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips. \"And my elf has been stunned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why -?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman\u0027s round, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" he said. \"Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn\u0027t know how! She\u0027d need a wand, for a start!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she had one,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"I found her holding one, Ludo. If it\u0027s all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she\u0027s got to say for herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, \"Ennervate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught sight of Mr. Diggory\u0027s feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elf!\" said Mr. Diggory sternly. \"Do you know who I am? I\u0027m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath coming in sharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An explanation, if you please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I - I is not doing it, sir!\" Winky gasped. \"I is not knowing how, sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were found with a wand in your hand!\" barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey - that\u0027s mine!\" he said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the clearing looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my wand!\" said Harry. \"I dropped it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dropped it?\" repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. \"Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos, think who you\u0027re talking to!\" said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. \"Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er - of course not,\" mumbled Mr. Diggory. \"Sorry...carried away...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t drop it there, anyway,\" said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull. \"I missed it right after we got into the wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet. \"You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up and thought you\u0027d have some fun with it, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I is not doing magic with it, sir!\" squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. \"I is...I is...I is just picking it up, sir! I is not making the Dark Mark, sir, I is not knowing how!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t her!\" said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. \"Winky\u0027s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!\" She looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. \"It didn\u0027t sound anything like Winky, did it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"It definitely didn\u0027t sound like an elf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it was a human voice,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027ll soon see,\" growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. \"There\u0027s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prior Incantato!\" roared Mr. Diggory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deletrius!\" Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon Winky, who was still shaking convulsively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I is not doing it!\" she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. \"I is not, I is not, I is not knowing how!

Amos Diggory looked horrified. \"Mr. Crouch...not...not at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark!\" barked Mr. Crouch. \"Harry Potter - and myself. I suppose you are familiar with the boy\u0027s story, Amos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course - everyone knows -\" muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly discomforted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career, that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them?\" Mr. Crouch shouted, his eyes bulging again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Crouch, I - I never suggested you had anything to do with it!\" Amos Diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!\" shouted Mr. Crouch. \"Where else would she have learned to conjure it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She - she might\u0027ve picked it up anywhere -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely, Amos,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"She might have picked it up anywhere....Winky?\" he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her. \"Where exactly did you find Harry\u0027s wand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I is finding it...finding it there, sir...\" she whispered, \"there...in the trees, sir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, Amos?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they\u0027d done it, leaving Harry\u0027s wand behind. A clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them.

Did you see anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr. Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, \"I is seeing no one, sir...no one...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos,\" said Mr. Crouch curtly, \"I am fully aware that, in the ordinary course of events, you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning.

A large crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there, and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who conjured it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur - it\u0027s not - Him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s not Him,\" said Mr. Weasley impatiently. \"We don\u0027t know who it was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s head was poking out of the boys\u0027 tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, what\u0027s going on?\" he called through the dark. \"Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got them here,\" said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get them, Dad?\" said Bill sharply. \"The person who conjured the Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"We found Barry Crouch\u0027s elf holding Harry\u0027s wand, but we\u0027re none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry\u0027s wand?\" said Fred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Crouch\u0027s elf?\" said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!\" he said. \"Running away when he\u0027d expressly told her not to...embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry...how would that have looked, if she\u0027d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t do anything - she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!\" Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy - better, indeed, than any of the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch\u0027s position can\u0027t afford a house-elf who\u0027s going to run amok with a wand!\" said Percy pompously, recovering himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t run amok!\" shouted Hermione. \"She just picked it up off the ground!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?\" said Ron impatiently. \"It wasn\u0027t hurting anyone....Why\u0027s it such a big deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, it\u0027s You-Know-Who\u0027s symbol, Ron,\" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \"I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it hasn\u0027t been seen for thirteen years,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly. \"Of course people panicked...it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it,\" said Ron, frowning. \"I mean...it\u0027s still only a shape in the sky...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The terror it inspired...you have no idea, you\u0027re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you\u0027re about to find inside....\" Mr. Weasley winced. \"Everyone\u0027s worst fear...the very worst...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \"Well, it didn\u0027t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we\u0027d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They\u0027re having their memories modified right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Death Eaters?\" said Harry. \"What are Death Eaters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what You-Know-Who\u0027s supporters called themselves,\" said Bill. \"I think we saw what\u0027s left of them tonight - the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t prove it was them, Bill,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Though it probably was,\" he added hopelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I bet it was!\" said Ron suddenly . \"Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what were Voldemort\u0027s supporters -\" Harry began. Everybody flinched - like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort\u0027s name. \"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"What were You-Know-Who\u0027s supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point?\" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. \"Harry, that\u0027s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn\u0027t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,\" he finished disgustedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?\" said Ron. \"They\u0027d have been pleased to see it, wouldn\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use your brains, Ron,\" said Bill. \"If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they\u0027d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they\u0027d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives....I don\u0027t reckon he\u0027d be over-pleased with them, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...whoever conjured the Dark Mark...\" said Hermione slowly, \"were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But I\u0027ll tell you this...it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I\u0027d be very surprised if the person who did it hadn\u0027t been a Death Eater once, even if they\u0027re not now....Listen, it\u0027s very late, and if your mother hears what\u0027s happened she\u0027ll be worried sick. We\u0027ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake - wide-awake, and worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days ago - it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days - he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort\u0027s mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie\u0027s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-harry-potter-4/page-9.html","bookId":1565,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:41:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:41:13 PM"}
