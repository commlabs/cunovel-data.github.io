{"id":109021,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe twenty-one-year-old Princess far surpassed the eighteen-year-old mourner. Her figure faults were gone, the too bony elbow having fleshed out nicely; the opposite pudgy wrist could not have been trimmer. Her hair, which was once the color of autumn, was still the color of autumn, except that before, she had tended it herself, whereas now she had five full-time hairdressers who managed things for her. (This was long after hairdressers; in truth, ever since there have been women, there have been hairdressers, Adam being the first, though the King James scholars do their very best to muddy this point.) Her skin was still wintry cream, but now, with two handmaidens assigned to each appendage and four for the rest of her, it actually, in certain lights, seemed to provide her with a gentle, continually moving as she moved, glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Humperdinck took her hand and held it high and the crowd cheered. “That’s enough, mustn’t risk overexposure,” the Prince said, and he started back in toward the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have waited, some of them, so long,” Buttercup answered. “I would like to walk among them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do not walk among commoners unless it is unavoidable,” the Prince said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have known more than a few commoners in my time,” Buttercup told him. “They will not, I think, harm me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that she left the balcony, reappeared a moment later on the great steps of the castle and, quite alone, walked open-armed down into the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever she went, the people parted. She crossed and recrossed the Great Square and always, ahead of her, the people swept apart to let her pass. Buttercup continued, moving slowly and smiling, alone, like some land messiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the people there would never forget that day. None of them, of course, had ever been so close to perfection, and the great majority adored her instantly. There were, to be sure, some who, while admitting she was pleasing enough, were withholding judgment as to her quality as a queen. And, of course, there were some more who were frankly jealous. Very few of them hated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd only three of them were planning to murder her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup, naturally, knew none of this. She was smiling, and when people wanted to touch her gown, well, let them, and when they wanted to brush their skin against hers, well, let them do that too. She had studied hard to do things royally, and she wanted very much to succeed, so she kept her posture erect and her smile gentle, and that her death was so close would have only made her laugh, if someone had told her. But—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—in the farthest corner of the Great Square—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—in the highest building in the land—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—deep in the deepest shadow—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—the man in black stood waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis boots were black and leather. His pants were black and his shirt. His mask was black, blacker than raven. But blackest of all were his flashing eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashing and cruel and deadly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup was more than a little weary after her triumph. The touching of the crowds had exhausted her, so she rested a bit, and then, toward midafternoon, she changed into her riding clothes and went to fetch Horse. This was the one aspect of her life that had not changed in the years preceding. She still loved to ride, and every afternoon, weather permitting or not, she rode alone for several hours in the wild land beyond the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did her best thinking then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that her best thinking ever expanded horizons. Still, she told herself, she was not a dummy either, so as long as she kept her thoughts to herself, well, where was the harm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she rode through woods and streams and heather, her brain was awhirl. The walk through the crowds had moved her, and in a way most strange. For even though she had done nothing for three years now but train to be a princess and a queen, today was the first day she actually understood that it was all soon to be a reality. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-33.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
