I could use Your help again. My stomach cramped as I shifted gears. Cole was patient with me, even when I barely edged the speedometer up to fifteen miles per hour and other cars were honking, then whizzing past us. A few drivers even gave me the finger and Cole nearly jumped out of his seat each time. However, a dark SUV followed us around several corners, content to go the same snail-like speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Justin’s people,” Cole said, probably noticing the number of times I’d glanced into the rearview mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. House burners are on my tail.” Just what I needed. Another stress factor. “Will they try anything?” The SUV’s windshield was tinted so dark I couldn’t see anyone inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. They just like to make their presence known. They’ll taper off at the next turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed a sigh of relief. “Justin told me his boss paid you a visit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing talking to Justin?” he asked, messing with the radio dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trying to get answers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From now on, get those from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s in my class. I didn’t want to ignore him and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali. You don’t know him or what he’s capable of doing, telling, or warping. It’ll be better for all of us if you listen to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay. I’ll ignore him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire drive lasted forty minutes when it probably should have taken only ten. He lived in a neighborhood where the homes were spaced acres apart, and the houses themselves had a farmlike quality. Each had red-and-white wood, detached barns, wire fences, and fields of wheat instead of trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when I threw the car into Park was I able to fully relax. We were safe. We were unscathed. Thanks again, Lord! \u0026nbsp;Seriously!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t promise we’ll ever use you for a hasty getaway,” Cole said, “but with a little work, you might be able to race my grandmother—while she’s on her scooter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not usually that bad. I’m sorry. I just…the accident…on top of seeing the rabbit....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What rabbit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, crap. As emotionally wrung out as I was, I finally found myself explaining about the cloud, even pointing it out to him. I told him how I’d seen it each day before the zombies emerged, and how, the first time, I’d lost everyone I loved. How my dead little sister had appeared to me and told me she was somehow creating the cloud as a warning. Midway through, Cole reached over and began to massage the back of my neck, the way he liked to do to himself, offering comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t think I’m crazy?” I asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I’m one to judge another person’s sanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not an answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, how about this? No, I don’t think you’re crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose to believe him. “Have you ever seen a witness? That’s what she called herself. Not a ghost, those don’t exist, and not an angel, those do, but a witness.” Like one of his slain friends, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ever heard the term?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Outside of a legal trial, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has anyone else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to my knowledge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I said, my shoulders slumping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s nothing wrong with you, Ali. You can see zombies when not many others can. Seeing witnesses or whatever is probably no different than that.” He ruffled my hair, making me feel about three years old. “Now come on, we’ve got a lot to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter tossing him the keys, I exited the Jeep and headed toward the house. Halfway there, he was at my side, twining our fingers and tugging me toward the barn in back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This way,” he said—and he refused to release me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were holding hands as if we were a couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closer we got to the door, the louder I heard the grunts and groans coming from inside. I blinked, thinking it sounded like people were being tortured in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out, yes, they were being tortured. Only, they were doing it to themselves. Throughout the barn I saw workout equipment, a training mat and even a boxing ring, as well as all the boys who’d been hanging around Cole that first day of school, plus a few that hadn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole made the introductions. There was Lucas, who was gorgeous and black, and practically bench-pressing a bus. He had a house arrest anklet on, and yet, I was pretty sure I’d seen him at Reeve’s party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerek, also black, stood at the end of a stall, shooting a dummy dressed to look like a zombie. Bronx hammered away at a punching bag. Brent, a blond, held it steady. Collins, a boy with a shaved head and house arrest anklet of his own, and Haun (Spike), an Asian boy with dark hair and eyes, were sword fighting, and, judging by the sound of metal clanging against metal, with real swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smorgasbord of hot, sweaty guys and warrior weapons. I’d stepped into every girl’s fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrosty and Mackenzie were running the treadmills. Trina and Cruz (Turd), a Hispanic boy with brown hair and a scar running down the side of his cheek, were in the ring, boxing without gloves. Aka punching the crap out of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood there, taking everything in, I could make out a thousand different scents. Something floral from Mackenzie, something musky from Haun. Something fruity from Collins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys do this every day after school?” I asked, trying to hide my nervousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much. Strength and stamina will save your life. Plus, we can take our weapons into the spirit realm, and they help us hobble the zombies for easier elimination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’ll be learning how to use them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but because of your injuries, you’re only doing spirit projection, the treadmill and target practice today. Once you heal, we’ll get you started with everything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” The way he eyed me up and down made me feel like a bug under a microscope. He took in everything, missed nothing. “Step out of your body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to register what he’d said. “Just like that?” I snapped my fingers, and gazed around self-consciously. “Here, now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me an unsympathetic nod. “Just like that. Here and now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long while, I tried, I swear I tried, but with no results. No matter how hard I attempted to push my spirit out of my body, the two remained connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve done it before,” Cole reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but I was under zombie duress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about this? Step out of your body or I’ll put you over my knee and spank you in front of everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huffed and puffed and gasped out, “I’d like to see you try!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for me. With a squeal I slapped his hand and darted out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five,” he said, a steely glint in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried for bravado. “What, you’re counting like you’re my mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Four.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was counting. Great. I took a moment to breathe in and out, slow and measured, my determination rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, visualized the zombies from the cemetery, the ones who’d hovered over my dad. My determination became a burning fire in my chest. Faith. I just needed faith. I could do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would do this. I would. Nothing could stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs easy as breathing, I stepped out of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne moment I was sweltering, the next I was bone-chillingly cold. My teeth chattered as I scanned the barn. I could see the glow of the Blood Lines, the smears over each of the windows. I could see each of the kids moving at a slower pace than I’d realized, sweat sliding down their temples, a bright light—energy?—softly radiating from their pores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole possessed the brightest light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scents inside the building intensified, so strong now my nostrils actually stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go back,” Cole said, his voice cranked to its highest setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCringing, I turned and saw that my body was frozen in place, perched right beside him. My expression was pinched with concentration. “How do—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t speak,” he shouted, and again I cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t speak!” I shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole reached out to slap his hand over my mouth, but his hand moved through me. For a moment, I felt as though I’d bathed in warm honey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaling, he pointed to his mouth. His jaw was working, the muscles twitching, but his lips remained stuck together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, I remembered. Whatever I spoke in this spiritual realm, and believed that I received, I would get. “You can speak, you can speak,” I rushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly his lips parted. “Not another word,” he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes narrowed, he reached out to touch his fingers to my body’s fingers, then motioned for me to do the same. Mirroring him, I placed my spirit fingers against my natural fingers. At the moment of contact, the rest of me slid into place as though pulled on a tether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” I hurried to say. “I’m sorry, but I thought I couldn’t violate free will, no matter what I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you there were rules and with rules come exceptions. Sometimes, when the right command is voiced, and it’s for defense, to protect yourself, free will is the weaker of the two and overshadowed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How? I told the zombies to let me go, but they still came back for a second helping. Believe me, the command was to protect myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You spoke to them all at once, I’m guessing, and weakened the power of your command, each one of the zombies experiencing only a measure of the compulsion to obey rather than the full force.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Clearly, I had more to learn than I’d realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now leave your body again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the ensuing forty-five minutes, I was only able to exit my body four times. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-47.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
