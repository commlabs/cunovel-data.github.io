Although he didn’t know exactly who Lin Ming was, he could tell from Lin Ming’s fighting methods and the pills he took out that it was likely he was part of the ancient races.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf this mysterious person was an abyssal then their pills would be blood pills filled with a thick demonic energy.

This caused the middle-aged man to believe that this mysterious person must have some extraordinary status. If he could win over this mysterious person and this mysterious person truly did empathize with their rebel army then they would be greatly helpful to their future plans.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnd indeed, when the middle-aged man spoke the words ‘secrets of the Demon God’s Tomb’, the mysterious person didn’t leave.

Originally, he thought that with the current state of the ancient races, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call the current slave resistance a ragtag team of nobodies. If so, then it would have been impossible for them to know anything concerning this level of matter. But he was wrong once again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDemon God’s Tomb… the black book that Lin Ming obtained from Xishen’s hands was one of the ceremonial rites books of the Demon God’s Tomb.
