There in its shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody\u0027s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge\u0027s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t... make one.\" he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \"Wouldn\u0027t... come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry\u0027s willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we still haven\u0027t got any food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Ron,\" snapped Hermione. \"Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn\u0027t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat low in one of Perkins\u0027s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today me might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon kicked a chair leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he snarled at Hermione. \"I\u0027m starving! All I\u0027ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\" said Harry, stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would, but my arm\u0027s in a sling, in case you hadn\u0027t noticed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s convenient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s that supposed to ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\" she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, \"the Horcrux, Harry, you\u0027re still wearing it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry\u0027s skin he felt oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better?\" asked Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, loads better!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, \"you don\u0027t think you\u0027ve been possessed, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? No!\" he said defensively, \"I remember everything we\u0027ve done while I\u0027ve bee wearing it. I wouldn\u0027t know what I\u0027d done if I\u0027d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn\u0027t remember anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. \"Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\" Harry stated firmly. \"If we lose it, if it gets stolen ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. \"But we\u0027ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" said Ron irritably, \"and now we\u0027ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, but we\u0027ll go somewhere else to find it,\" said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. \"There\u0027s no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not stealing, is it?\" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. \"Not if I left some money under the chicken coo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, \"Er-my-nee, \u0027oo worry \u0027oo much. \u0027Elax!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because be had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys\u0027. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron\u0027s turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where next?\" was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised: Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, let\u0027s go to Albania. Shouldn\u0027t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,\" said Ron sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There can\u0027t be anything there. He\u0027d already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\" said Hermione. \"We know the snake\u0027s not in Albania, it\u0027s usually with Vol ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I ask you to stop say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who ¨C happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not particularly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes.\" said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \"Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would\u0027ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, \"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart\u0027s secrets. I\u0027m telling you, if there was one place Vol ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!\" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. \"If there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" scoffed Ron. \"His school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special: it meant everything to him, and even after he left ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is You-Know-Who we\u0027re talking about, right? Not you?\" inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder\u0027s object, to make into another Horcrux?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he didn\u0027t get the job, did he?\" said Hermione. \"So he never got the chance to find a founder\u0027s object there and hide it in the school!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then,\" said Harry, defeated. \"Forget Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searching for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could try digging in to foundations?\" Hermione suggested halfheartedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t have hidden a Horcrux here,\" Harry said. He had known it all along. The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts of the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its gilded doors and marble floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What did you see?\" demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A face,\" muttered Harry, every time. \"The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry\u0027s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people\u0027s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother,\" said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, \"can make good food appear out of thin air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron\u0027s neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother can\u0027t produce food out of thin air,\" said Hermione. \"no one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp\u0027s Law of Elemental Transfigura ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, speak English, can\u0027t you?\" Ron said, prying a fish out from between his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you\u0027ve already got some ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t bother increasing this, it\u0027s disgusting,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I\u0027m always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I\u0027m a girl, I suppose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s because you\u0027re supposed to be the best at magic!\" shot back Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I\u0027ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!,\" said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. \"Shut up now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione looked outraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?\" he whispered to Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did everything,\" she whispered back, \"Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn\u0027t be able to hear of see us, whoever they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d\u0027you reckon it\u0027s too early in the season? Accio Salmon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, Griphook, Gornuk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said the goblins together in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you three have been on the run how long?\" asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six weeks... Seven... I forget,\" said the tired man. \"Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a but of company.\" There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. \"What made you leave, Ted?\" continued the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knew they were coming for me,\" replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks\u0027s father. \"Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I\u0027d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I\u0027d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she\u0027s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muggle-born, eh?\" asked the first man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not sure ,\" said Dean. \"My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I\u0027ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to say, Dirk, I\u0027m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was that you\u0027d been caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was,\" said Dirk. \"I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you\u0027d think; I don\u0027t reckon he\u0027s quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I\u0027d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on.

You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping, by the sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, \"The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not so lunatic these days,\" said Ted. \"You want to give it a look, Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet\u0027s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they\u0027ll let him get with it, mind, I don\u0027t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who\u0027s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to help a boy who\u0027s vanished off the face of the earth,\" said Dirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, the fact that they haven\u0027t caught him yet\u0027s one hell of an achievement,\" said Ted. \"I\u0027d take tips from him gladly; it\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to do, stay free, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, you\u0027ve got a point there,\" said Dirk heavily. \"With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him, I\u0027d have expected him to be caught by now.

When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more then, \"Ginny ¨C the sword ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know!\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here... we... are...\" she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione\u0027s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in Dumbledore\u0027s office,\" she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, \"Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless he was asleep,\" said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er ¨C Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phineas Nigellus?\" said Hermione again. \"Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Please\u0027 always helps,\" said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At one, Hermione cried:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obscura!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus\u0027s clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ¨C how dare ¨C what are you ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very sorry, Professor Black,\" said Hermione, \"but it\u0027s a necessary precaution!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remove this foul addition at once!

What is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind where we are,\" said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus\u0027s interest. \"We\u0027ve got a couple of questions to ask you ¨C about the sword of Gryffindor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, \"Yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up about my sister,\" said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else is here?\" he asked, turning his head from side to side. \"Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme.

Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind that!

Have you told Snape you saw this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore.

Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus\u0027s back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sword can destroy Horcruxes!

Dread doused Harry\u0027s jubilation; Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like I\u0027m not having the time of my life here,\" said Ron, \"you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we\u0027d been running round a few weeks, we\u0027d have achieved something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron,\" Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you knew what you\u0027d signed up for.\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I thought I did too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what part of it isn\u0027t living up to your expectations?\" asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. \"Did you think we\u0027d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you\u0027d be back to Mummy by Christmas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought you knew what you were doing!\" shouted Ron, standing up, and his words Harry like scalding knives. \"We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron!\" said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sorry to let you down,\" said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. \"I\u0027ve been straight with you from the start. I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in the case you haven\u0027t noticed, we\u0027ve found one Horcrux ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and we\u0027re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them ¨C nowhere effing near in other words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take off the locket, Ron,\" Hermione said, her voice unusually high. \"Please take it off. You wouldn\u0027t be talking like this if you hadn\u0027t been wearing it all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he would,\" said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. \"D\u0027you think I haven\u0027t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D\u0027you think I didn\u0027t guess you were thinking this stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, we weren\u0027t ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lie!\" Ron hurled at her. \"You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you\u0027d thought he had a bit more to go on than ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say it like that ¨C Harry, I didn\u0027t!\" she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione\u0027s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and their were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why are you still here?\" Harry asked Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search me,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go home then,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, maybe I will!\" shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. \"Didn\u0027t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don\u0027t give a rat\u0027s fart, do you, it\u0027s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I\u0027ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn\u0027t care what happened to her in there ¨C well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only saying ¨C she was with the others, they were with Hagrid ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I get it, you don\u0027t care! And what about the rest of my family, \u0027the Weasleys don\u0027t need another kid injured,\u0027 did you hear that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bothered what it meant, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron!\" said Hermione, forcing her way between them. \"I don\u0027t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don\u0027t know about; think, Ron, Bill\u0027s already scared, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you\u0027re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I\u0027m sure that\u0027s all he meant ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won\u0027t bother myself about them. It\u0027s all right for you, isn\u0027t it, with your parents safely out of the way ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents are dead!\" Harry bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mine could be going the same way!\" yelled Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then GO!\" roared Harry. \"Go back to them, pretend you\u0027re got over your spattergroit and Mummy\u0027ll be able to feed you up and ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner\u0027s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prestego!\" she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave the Horcrux,\" Harry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you staying, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" She looked anguished. \"Yes ¨C yes, I\u0027m staying. Ron, we said we\u0027d go with Harry, we said we\u0027d help ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get it. You choose him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron, no ¨C please ¨C come back, come back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron\u0027s name amongst the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s g-g-gone! Disapparated!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron\u0027s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-15.html","bookId":1567,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:12 PM"}
