He doesn’t deserve to get shoved out of a shower stall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I hear Storm exclaim, but I’m not listening. I don’t need Ben and Storm prodding me forward. My own internal urges are doing just fine battling with my will power. I really want to go talk to Trent. Stand next to him. Kiss him … Whatever switch I’ve relied on these past few years to block all appeal and make my life easy has failed me miserably, opening the doors to a flood of desire and emotions that I don’t know how to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s too … good. And nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re nice too. Once you stop trying to be a bitch.” The way she adds that last part, it’s as if she wasn’t planning on saying it out loud. I catch her eyes widen in a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nicely done, Storm,” I commend her genuinely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sticks her tongue out at me. “He’s been sitting in a strip club all night, waiting for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, the horror,” I mutter as I point to the stage where Skyla and Candy grind against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you guys talking about?” A Greek goddess with br**sts to rival Storm’s calls out as she places an order of drinks on her tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Table thirty-two,” Storm says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roll of her eyes, she ascertains, “That dude’s g*y.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what’s he doing in Penny’s, Pepper?” Storm asks in a sweet tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePepper. Pshhh! Stupid name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePepper gives a lazy shrug. “China’s been workin’ him hard for a private dance, half off, and he won’t give. He’s keepin’ a close eye on Ben though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my tongue before I explain that he won’t give because he doesn’t like dirty-ass sluts. I don’t know who this China is, but I want to rip her guts out. I’m not too fond of Pepper either. I should stalk over there and pee around his table to stake my claim. Wait ... what? Jeez, Kacey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s just waiting for his private show with Kacey later,” Storm offers and spins on her heels. I catch Pepper’s eyes narrow as she studies what she must see as cash-competition. I can’t tell what’s going on in that mind of hers. I doubt it can be much. I glare back at her all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here.” Storm shoves a filled glass into my hand. “Go and talk to him again. You need a break anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” I hiss. “But when we come back, we need to discuss my stage name. Maybe something like ‘Salt,’ or ‘Lollipop’ or ‘Pomegranate.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear ‘Blue Balls’ might fit better,” Storm throws in with a sly wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp, my finger jabbing the air pointedly at her and then searching the crowd for Ben, ready to cleave his tongue out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, he just wanted to make sure you were okay,” she whispers, all hints of joking gone. “I don’t judge. Your secret’s safe with me, you vixen.” I head toward the exit when Storm shouts, “Hey! How about Vixen as your stage name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore her, sucking in a lungs worth of air as I lift the counter panel and walk through. I try not to fuss too much with my dress, but I do it all the same. Hell, just admit it, Kacey. Trent intimidates you. Just looking at him perched on his chair, leaning against the table, butterflies slam around inside my stomach. When it’s obvious that I’m heading straight for Trent, I notice him sit up straighter, like he might be a bit anxious too. That brings me small relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place his club soda down on the table with a small smile. “What are the chances that you’re still here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are the chances, indeed.” He offers me a wry smile in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A guy moves into a new town and spends every night at the local strip club. Alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent doesn’t miss a beat. “… and finds two of his neighbors working behind the bar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up his empty glass. “Storm has convinced me it will be a life-altering experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze skims the stage floor suggestively and I catch a flicker of disapproval in them. “I guess that depends on what you’re doing here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I quickly throw out. “Clothes on at all times. It’s mandatory.” I bite my lip. A little too eager to announce that, Kacey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent considers my face for a moment and then he nods. “Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but drift to Trent’s lips when he says that, how they remain parted after, how soft they look. “Um …” I shake my head, trying to uncloud my thoughts. “So you’re not holding back on the strong stuff tonight, I see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives his drink a long, hard look. Another small smile. “Yeah, you better watch out. I get crazy when I drink this shit straight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggle. I giggle! “What do you drink when you’re not downing soda like a fiend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Milk, water. The occasional Coke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. “No beer? JD? Tequila?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head as he takes the straw between his lips, a flash of seriousness smoothing his grin. “Don’t touch the stuff anymore.” His eyes slide up to meet mine and they stay there for a moment. “I like being fully aware of everything that’s happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFully aware. Really, Trent? You want to know that my thong is drenched right now? I lick my lips without thinking, attracting his attention to my mouth. Heat rises through my body, crawling up my neck, down my back, along my thighs. “I … um …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, he breaks the awkwardness. “So what brings you to Miami?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Change of scenery?” I offer his earlier excuse, silently praying that he won’t press me with any personal questions. Right now, I think I’d sing like a canary. Anything to keep him talking to me. Mercifully, Trent doesn’t press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you changed your mind, sweetheart?” A lusty voice says behind me, interrupting us. I turn to find a fake redhead moving in. She’s just tall enough to prop her voluptuous br**sts onto the table in front of Trent. I watch as a red claw runs down the length of Trent’s muscular forearm. This must be China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part of me wants to spin around and slam the bottom of my heel into her head. In kickboxing, we’d call that a Spinning Back Kick. Here, it’s called, “how to get my crazy jealous ass fired.” There’s no way I’d get a thumbs up from Cain on that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other part of me is curious about how Trent’s going to handle this “accosting.” After the constant parade that first night, things had been fairly tame. I have to think it’s because, like Pepper, they presume he’s waiting for Ben to start batting for the other team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my pleasant surprise, Trent pulls his arm off the table and adjusts himself in his chair so his body is angled toward me. “I’m fine, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a slight pout, she purrs, “You sure? You’ll regret it. I’m quite entertaining.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes lock on my face and he doesn’t attempt to conceal the smolder in them. “Not as much as I’ll regret leaving my present company. I think she could entertain me for a lifetime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skips three beats and my breath hitches. If there was ever any doubt about Trent’s interest, he’s crushed it with that look, with those words. I don’t notice China’s scowl, which I’m sure is stripping the skin from my bones right now. I don’t notice her walk away. I don’t notice anything around me anymore. Trent and I are suddenly the only two people in the bar and that same uncontrollable urge I felt the day he saved me from the snake now gets a hold of me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1/page-22.html","bookId":1854,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:39 PM"}
