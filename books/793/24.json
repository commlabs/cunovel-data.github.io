{"id":10056,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. THE LITTLE FLOWER-GIRL.","content":"Gilbert found it very irksome to be without employment; besides, he was anxious to be vindicated as soon as possible from the malicious charge which had been made against him. He felt himself fortunate, however, in one respect; he was subjected to no privations, having his board and lodging paid by his guardian. Had Mr. Briggs suspected him, he was proud enough to have left his boarding-place, and relied upon his own exertions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From the force of habit, and partly to fill up his time, Gilbert continued to go down-town daily. One day he met Mr. Vivian on Broadway, below the Astor House.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good-morning, Gilbert,” said the merchant, pleasantly. “Are you out on business?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 215“No, sir,” answered Gilbert. “I am out of business just at present.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I thought you were in the office of a stock-broker.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So I was; but I have lost my place.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Through no fault of your own, I am sure.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, sir. I should not have lost my place if Mr. Sands had been in the city. During his absence the book-keeper, who has a dislike to me because I superseded his cousin, discharged me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come up this evening to my house, Gilbert. Then I shall be at leisure, and you can tell me all the details of the affair.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank you, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am sure he won’t credit the charge against me,” thought Gilbert, and this thought encouraged him not a little.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gilbert continued his walk. As he was passing Trinity church-yard, he was accosted by a little girl, of perhaps eight years old. “Won’t you buy some flowers, sir?—only five cents.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gilbert shook his head mechanically. Then he 216glanced at the little girl, and his sympathy was aroused. She was poorly dressed, with a fragile figure, and thin, pale face, which yet only lacked the roundness and rosy hue of health to be uncommonly pretty. She did not repeat her request, but she looked sad and depressed. Gilbert paused and spoke to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you sold many flowers to-day, little girl?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, sir; only three bunches,” she replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where do you get them?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I sell them for a woman.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How much does she give you for selling them?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Two cents a bunch.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then you have only made six cents to-day. How long have you been standing here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ever since eight o’clock,” said the little girl, wearily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t you get tired being on your feet so long?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wouldn’t care for that if the people would only buy my flowers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are young to be sent out in this way. Haven’t you got a father to take care of you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 217“Papa used to take care of me when he was well, and did not let me come out; but now he is sick, and we have no money, and I have to leave him,” said the little girl, sadly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Poor child!” said Gilbert, compassionately. “You are unfortunate. Where does your father live?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “On Pearl Street, in a tenement house,” said the little flower-girl; “but I am afraid we will be turned out because we cannot pay the rent.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is your name?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Emma Talbot.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then, Emma, if you like, I will go around and see your father with you. Perhaps I can help him, or get some of my friends to help him. Can you come now?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “When I have sold this bunch of flowers, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “As it is the last you have got, I will take it; so we needn’t wait.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, thank you, sir,” said the child, brightening up. “If you won’t mind, I will stop and buy a roll at the baker’s for papa.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 218“Certainly, Emma. I have plenty of time. Wait; take my hand while we cross the street, you must be careful, or you may be run over.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wait for the policeman generally,” said the little girl. “I should be afraid to cross alone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are quite right to be careful.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The little girl took his hand confidingly, and together they crossed the City Hall Park. It was a new sensation to Gilbert to have the charge of a little girl. He had always been thrown among boys, and, never having had a sister, was very ignorant of girls, and the tastes of girls. For the first time, as he held Emma’s hand, it occurred to him that he would like to have a little sister, whom he could pet and protect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he was crossing the Park, he met his successor, John, sauntering along at a snail’s pace. John had been sent out on an errand, but had fallen into his old way of loitering and wasting the time which belonged to his employer. When he caught sight of Gilbert he started in surprise at his young companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 219“Hallo, Greyson!” he said, by way of opening a conversation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good-morning,” said Gilbert, coldly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is that your sister?” asked John, looking hard at Emma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” answered Gilbert, shortly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ho, ho!” laughed John. “I understand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am glad you do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’ve got a place as a girl’s nurse. That’s good.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are very witty,” said Gilbert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How much wages do you get?” continued John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think I had better not tell you, or you might get up a conspiracy to deprive me of my position.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What do you mean by that?” asked John, uncomfortably.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You know well enough what I mean. You know that you got your present place by dishonorable means. But I don’t think you’ll keep it long.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’d better take care what you say,” blustered John. “My cousin may have you arrested yet.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is quite at liberty to do so,” answered Gilbert, 220unterrified. “I don’t think he will find it prudent though.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Because it might come out who really put the money in my coat-pocket.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You did it yourself.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are mistaken. I have found out who did put it in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think you need any information on that point.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Look here,” said John, angrily, “you’d better not tell any lies to Mr. Sands when he comes back.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have no occasion to do so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’d better leave the city, or Mr. Sands may have you arrested.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will risk that.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess you can get a place in Philadelphia,” said John. “I’ll get my cousin to give you a recommendation if you’ll promise to go there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How can he recommend me after discharging me for theft?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 221“He’ll think this will be a lesson to you. Shall I ask him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, thank you. I don’t intend to leave the city at present.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m afraid that chap will make trouble for me yet,” muttered John to himself, as Gilbert walked away with the little girl; “but he can’t prove anything. I guess me and cousin Simon will be more than a match for him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1888/54504.html","bookId":793,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:48:34 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:48:34 AM"}
