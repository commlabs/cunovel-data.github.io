Major TMI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“TMI,” I muttered, staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too much information, Hawk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe, we’re all in our thirties. Von is married. We grew up, learned control and to be smart. The drunkenness, puke and pregnancy scares are history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d left out the fights and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something came to me. “You don’t use protection with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did the first few times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was true, he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But –”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rifled through your shit, saw your birth control pills. Put you on radar, saw you shared that body with no one but me, decided it was unnecessary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes got squinty again. “You rifled through my shit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gwen, baby, clue in. I was makin’ you mine. When I make a woman mine, I do my homework.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, uncertain what this meant and deciding for sanity’s sake not to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I mumbled, “I need a homemade donut,” because I did. I needed three. Then I needed to get my ass to the mall. I felt another little black dress coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was interrupted in my plan of attack on the mall when Hawk plucked me out of bed, twisted me, I landed on my back and was pressed into the mattress by his weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you’re gettin’ stressy,” he muttered, his eyes scanning my face, his hands skimming my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My childhood home was firebombed last night and I don’t know what to do about you. Of course I’m getting stressy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face disappeared in my neck and he murmured in my ear, “I can teach you better ways to deal with stress than downin’ donuts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this to be true since he’d already expended a fair amount of effort on those lessons. Except for stressing out about why I was letting him visit me, after a night with him my body felt like I’d received a one and a half hour full body massage at the hands of a master while in a steam room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands to his shoulders and exerted pressure, saying, “My stepmom and your commandos are in the kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head came up and he looked down at me, his eyes warm and my belly got squishy. “We’ll be quick and quiet,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could be quick? He’d never been quick before. He was a man who took his time and he did this in a good way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t have sex in a house that Meredith is in. And I can’t have sex with you because I haven’t decided what to do about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t paying attention so when his hands met the hem of my nightshirt then went in and up, the warmth of them light on my skin made me shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about I help you decide,” he offered then his head dipped and his lips slid across my jaw and that felt nice, coupled with his hands still moving on me, I did another shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled myself together. “No, I need to make the decision on my own. I’m compiling a mental pros and cons list of whether I should explore things with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head came up, his lips in a minor grin but the dimples were there. One of his hands stilled but the other one came out of my nightshirt, lifted and ran along my hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you got?” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re bossy, arrogant, intrusive, annoying and you crushed Troy like a bug without thought or remorse. Those are cons,” I shared honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis minor grin amplified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee! Totally unrepentant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, and you don’t listen to me,” I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore grinning then, “Do I have anything going for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the very rare occasion you can be sweet, you’re a cuddler and you carried me out of a burning building. Those are the pros.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a cuddler?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You spoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows went up. “That’s important enough to put on your list?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh… yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, grinning nearly at a smile then he noted, “Fuckin’ ridiculous what women think is important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes got squinty and I snapped, “Con!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin became a smile when he whispered, “You forgot a pro, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I corrected. “So far, that list is exhaustive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand in my nightshirt moved up and the warmth of it cupped my breast. I sucked in air and stilled, then melted and let out the air on a quiet gasp when the skin of his palm slid across my nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely a pro,” he muttered while watching my face then his head dropped and he kissed me. This was a triple threat because his tongue in my mouth, his hand at my breast (now with thumb action that was nice) and his hard, heavy body pinning mine to the bed was irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, definitely a pro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth released mine, his thumb stopped its brilliant torture and his fingers cupped my breast and I found my fingers curled around the back of his head, my other arm tight around his back and one of my calves had moved to hook around the back of his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was gazing up at him firm in the knowledge that I wanted to discover quick when he grinned and his warm hand gave my breast a firm squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what I mean, baby?” he whispered. “Definitely pro.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. Then I stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I stated, “And see what I mean, baby? Definitely arrogant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did that manly, deep, amused chuckle, dipped his head, kissed the indentation at the base of my throat, his hand disappeared from my breast and he rolled off me, taking me with him. We were on our feet beside the bed, his arms around me, before I could blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to work, get shit done,” he declared. “Tonight I need you focused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On what?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face got closer and his arms got tighter. “On me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My parents are staying here,” I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got a place,” he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lair. Hmm. Another shiver which he felt and I knew it because it caused him to grin another grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms gave me a squeeze. “Work, then tonight I add to the right side of your list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to tell him I should make my decision without my mind muddled by his superhuman sexual powers but I didn’t get a word out. His head bent, his mouth touched mine and then, poof! he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swayed a second without his strong arms around me and his solid body to rest against. Then I turned to stare at the bedroom door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-33.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
