I\u0027m trying to get him a prosthesis.

I spoke to the principal at the Lincoln Preparatory School, and she\u0027s agreed to have Kemal enrolled there on a trial basis. Could you take him over tomorrow morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I - \" It took Dana a moment to let it sink in. \"Oh, that\u0027s wonderful! I\u0027m so pleased.

And a lot of kindness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLincoln Preparatory School was an imposing complex consisting of a large Edwardian building, three smaller annexes, spacious, well-tended grounds, and extensive, manicured playing fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in front of the entrance, Dana said, \"Kemal, this is the best school in Washington. You can learn a lot here, but you have to have a positive attitude about it. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can\u0027t get into any fights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana and Kemal were ushered into the office of Rowana Trott, the school\u0027s principal. She was an attractive woman with a friendly manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome,\" she said. She turned to Kemal. \"I\u0027ve heard a great deal about you, young man. We\u0027re all looking forward to having you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana waited for Kemal to say something. When he was silent, she said, \"Kemal is looking forward to being here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I think you\u0027re going to make some very nice friends at our school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal stood there without answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn older woman came into the office. Mrs. Trott said, \"This is Becky. Becky, this is Kemal. Why don\u0027t you show Kemal around? Let him become acquainted with some of his teachers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. This way, Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal looked at Dana beseechingly, then turned and followed Becky out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to explain about Kemal,\" Dana began. \"He - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Trott said, \"You don\u0027t have to, Miss Evans. Elliot Cromwell told me about the situation and about Kemal\u0027s background. I understand he\u0027s been through more than any child should ever have to go through, and we\u0027re prepared to make allowances for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a transcript of his grades from Theodore Roosevelt Middle School. We\u0027re going to see if we can\u0027t better them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana nodded. \"Kemal\u0027s a very bright boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he is. His grades in math prove that. We\u0027re going to try to give him an incentive to excel in all his other subjects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fact that he has only one arm is very traumatic for him,\" Dana said. \"I hope to be able to solve that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Trott nodded understandingly. \"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kemal was through with his tour of the school and he and Dana were walking back to the car, Dana said, \"I know you\u0027re going to like it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a beautiful school, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal said, \"It sucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana stopped. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal\u0027s voice was choked. \"They have tennis courts and a football field and I can\u0027t - \" His eyes filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana wrapped her arms around him. \"I\u0027m sorry, darling.\" And she thought to herself, I\u0027ve got to do something about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dinner party at the Hudsons\u0027 on Saturday night was a glamorous, black-tie affair. The beautiful rooms were filled with the movers and shakers of the nation\u0027s capital, including the Secretary of Defense, several members of Congress, the head of the Federal Reserve, and the ambassador from Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger and Pamela were standing at the door when Dana and Jeff arrived. Dana introduced Jeff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I enjoy your sports column and broadcasts,\" Roger Hudson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela said, \"Let me introduce you to some of our guests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the faces were familiar, and the greetings were cordial. It seemed that most of the guests were fans of either Dana or Jeff or both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were alone for a moment, Dana said, \"My God. The guest list here reads likeWho\u0027s Who. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff took her hand. \"You\u0027rethe biggest celebrity here, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" Dana said. \"I\u0027m just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Dana saw General Victor Booster and Jack Stone heading toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening, General,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooster looked at her and said rudely, \"What the hell are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a social evening,\" the general snapped. \"I didn\u0027t know the media was invited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff looked at General Booster, furious. \"Hold it!\" he said. \"We have as much right - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor Booster ignored him. He leaned close to Dana. \"Remember what I promised you if you go looking for trouble.\" He walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff looked after him disbelievingly. \"Jesus. What was that all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Stone stood there, red-faced. \"I\u0027m - I\u0027m terribly sorry. The general gets that way sometimes. He isn\u0027t always tactful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We noticed,\" Jeff said icily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dinner itself was fantastic. In front of each couple was a beautifully handwritten menu:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussian blini with beluga caviar and light vodka cream cheese\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbassador pheasant broth with white truffle essence and green asparagus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBismarck foie gras with Boston lettuce, peppercorns, and Xeres vinegar dressing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaine lobster thermidor glazed with Mornay champagne sauce\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFillet of beef Wellington with roasted potato Orloff and sauteed vegetables\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm chocolate souffle with orange zest liqueur and chocolate morsels, served with nougatine sauce\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a Lucullan banquet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Dana\u0027s surprise, she found that she had been seated next to Roger Hudson. Pamela\u0027s doing, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pamela mentioned that Kemal is enrolled in the Lincoln Preparatory School.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana smiled. \"Yes. Elliot Cromwell arranged it. He\u0027s a remarkable man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger Hudson nodded. \"So I\u0027ve heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment. \"This may mean nothing, but it seems that shortly before Taylor Winthrop became our ambassador to Russia, he told close friends that he had definitely retired from public life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana frowned. \"And then he accepted the ambassadorship to Russia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way home, Jeff asked Dana, \"What did you do to make such a fan of General Booster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t want me investigating the deaths in the Winthrop family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t explain. He just barks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff said slowly, \"His bite is worse than his bark, Dana. He\u0027s a bad enemy to have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Jeff curiously. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s head of the FRA, the Federal Research Agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. They develop technology to help underdeveloped countries learn modern production and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff said dryly, \"And there really is a Santa Claus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked at him, puzzled. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The agency is a cover-up. The real function of the FRA is to spy on foreign intelligence agencies and intercept their communications. It\u0027s ironic. \"Frater\" means brother in Latin - only this is Big Brother, and Big Brother sure as hell is watching everybody. They\u0027re more secretive than even the NSA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said thoughtfully, \"Taylor Winthrop was once the head of the FRA. That\u0027s interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would advise you to stay as far away as you can from General Booster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you have a sitter problem tonight, honey, so if you have to get home - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana nestled against him. \"No way. The sitter can wait. I can\u0027t. Let\u0027s go to your place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff grinned. \"I thought you\u0027d never ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff lived in a small apartment in a four-story building on Madison Street. Jeff led Dana into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be glad when we move into a bigger apartment,\" Jeff said. \"Kemal has to have his own room. Why don\u0027t we - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we stop talking?\" Dana suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff took her in his arms. \"Great idea.\" He reached behind her and curved his hands around her hips, stroking her softly and gently. He started to undress her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know you have a great body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the fellows tell me that,\" Dana said. \"It\u0027s the talk of the town. Are you planning to get undressed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking it over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana moved up against him and started to unbutton his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know you\u0027re a hussy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"You bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jeff finished undressing, Dana was in bed waiting for him. She warmed herself in the summer of his arms. He was a wonderful lover, sensual and caring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you so much,\" Dana whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, my darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jeff reached for her, a cell phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours or mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed. It rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine,\" Jeff said. \"Let it ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be important,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right.\" Jeff sat up, disgruntled. He picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" His voice changed. \"No, it\u0027s all right...Go ahead...Of course...I\u0027m sure there\u0027s nothing to worry about. It\u0027s probably just stress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation went on for five minutes. \"Right...So take it easy...Fine...Good night, Rachel.\" He clicked the phone off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn\u0027t it awfully late at night for Rachel to be calling? \"Is anything wrong, Jeff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Rachel\u0027s been doing too much. She just needs a rest. She\u0027ll be fine.\" He took Dana in his arms and said softly, \"Where were we?\" He pulled her naked body to his and the magic began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana forgot about the problems with the Winthrops and Joan Sinisi and generals and housekeepers and Kemal and schools, and life became a joyous, passionate celebration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, Dana said reluctantly, \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s time for Cinderella to turn into a pumpkin, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what a pumpkin! I\u0027ll get my carriage ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at him. \"I think it\u0027s ready. One more time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana got home, the woman from the sitter service was impatiently waiting to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one-thirty,\" she said accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I got tied up.\" Dana gave the woman some extra money. \"Take a taxi,\" she said. \"It\u0027s dangerous out there. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sitter said, \"Miss Evans, I think you should know...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All evening Kemal kept pestering me about when you were coming home.
