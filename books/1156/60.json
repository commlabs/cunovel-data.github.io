This is no time to exchange compliments,\" he said. \"We have parleyed here too long already.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His grasp tightened on the slender wrist, but she did not seem to heed the pain of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can not, I will not go with you!\" she panted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A taunting laugh answered her. He was dragging her by main force down the path, when the figure of a man suddenly sprung before him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You!\" cried Royal Ainsley, furiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it is I!\" returned Eugene Mallard, sternly. \"I am just in time, it appears, to save my—this lady from you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the sight of Eugene, Ida flung up her hands with a wild cry, and sunk at his feet unconscious. Royal Ainsley sprung forward to catch her in his arms, but Eugene dashed up to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lay one hand on her at your peril!\" he commanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And who shall prevent me, when she is my wife?\" sneered Royal Ainsley.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is not your wife!\" cried Eugene Mallard, his face darkening; \"and here and now, I propose to avenge the wrongs you have done her. There will be a duel to the death between us! I have two pistols in my pocket, you shall take one and defend yourself, I will use the other.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [249]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley sprung forward. Quick as a flash he drew something from his vest-pocket. It was a sharp steel dagger which he always carried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He made a lunge forward, but his foot slipped, and he fell to the earth in mortal pain. The dagger he had intended to plunge into the body of his cousin had been the cause of his own death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In an instant Eugene was bending over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is too late!\" gasped the miserable man—\"it is all over with me now. I am about to pass in my checks. Don\u0027t you think so?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Eugene; \"you are mortally wounded, I can see that. Heaven forgive you for the sins you have committed!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eugene carried Ida to her own room, thanking Heaven that he had met no one. No one would know of her presence in the grounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he quickly summoned the servants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley, lying there with his face upturned to the sunlight and his hand clutching the fatal dagger, told its own story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As soon as Ida was able to see him Eugene sent for her to come to the library.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she received the summons, the poor soul, white as death, fell upon her knees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is going to denounce me for my sin, and for not telling him when I found it out,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Could she face him, now that he knew all?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As she knelt there she caught a glimpse of herself in the great mirror opposite.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again the girl knocked at the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell your master that I will see him to-morrow,\" she[250] whispered in a strained, strange voice; and the girl went away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Strange fancies seemed to throng through her brain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley was dead, she had heard them say; and she fancied that her child was dead, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now the man she loved had sent for her to turn her from the house, and she would never see him again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she thought of the brook, so deep, so wide, that struggled on to meet the sea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, she would go there where some of the happiest, ay, and some of the most sorrowful moments of her life had been spent. The deep waters would carry her away on their bosom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At intervals the girl came to the door to inquire if she wanted anything. The answer was always the same—\"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She never knew how the long hours passed; she was like one in a dream.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last night came. She waited until the house was dark and still. There was silence in the hall. All the lights were out, every one was asleep, and the troubles of the day were blotted out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She raised the long French window that opened out onto the lawn and stepped out into the garden.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As she passed the room in which Eugene Mallard was quietly sleeping, she knelt and laid her cold white lips on the threshold his feet would press.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How cruelly Heaven had punished her, because in those other days she had longed to be a lady, like the heroines she had read of in the great world of beauty and fashion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She reached the brook and knelt down beside it. The moon threw a silvery light upon it, and in its song she[251] seemed to hear Eugene\u0027s voice mingled with that of the little child she had lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am coming to you, little baby!\" she muttered below her breath. Then aloud, she said: \"Good-bye, Eugene—good-bye forever!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly a pair of strong arms clasped her, and Eugene\u0027s voice whispered:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not good-bye, my darling!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only the stars and the moonlight and the rippling waters of the brook heard what he said—how he pleaded with her to live only for him and her little child.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ida could not believe the great happiness that had suddenly fallen upon her like a mantle from God\u0027s hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They talked by the brook-side for long hours. The next day the master and mistress of the great mansion went away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they reached New York, another ceremony was performed, which made Ida Eugene Mallard\u0027s wife until death should part them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they quietly went and obtained the little child, whom both idolized, and went abroad, where they remained for years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No one learned the strange romance of the fair young girl whom Eugene Mallard worshipped so fondly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they returned to their home, years after, with a lovely, dark-eyed little girl and a sturdy, blue-eyed boy, no one guessed but that they were Eugene Mallard\u0027s children.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While they had been abroad they read of the marriage of Hildegarde Cramer to Philip Ravenswood, the noble young man who had loved her ever since they had first met on the Newport sands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The same paper also brought the intelligence of the[252] engagement of Arthur Hollis and pretty Dora Staples, and the sad ending, in a railroad accident, of beautiful, hapless Vivian Deane and her maid Nora.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eugene passed the paper to his wife, and Ida read it, making no comments. But after awhile, as though the subject weighed heavily on her mind, she went up to Eugene, and laid her soft white arms round his neck, and whispered:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Does the knowledge of Hildegarde\u0027s marriage bring you any regrets, Eugene?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, my darling!\" he cried, clasping her in his strong arms. \"For all the love of my heart is yours now, and—and—our children\u0027s.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have often wanted to ask you, Eugene,\" she murmured, with her face hidden on his breast, \"if the story of my past were known, how would people judge me? Would the world say, \u0027Ida May had sinned\u0027?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let us hope all our readers will join heartily in his answer—\"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49832.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
