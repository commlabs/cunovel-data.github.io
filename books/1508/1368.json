He put away the space shuttle and began flying towards the center of the Eternal Demon Abyss. At this point, there was no time to delay. His injuries were great and now that he couldn’t use the space shuttle, he would have to fly through the Eternal Demon Abyss at high speeds in its most dangerous period.
