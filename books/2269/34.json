Thor stared coldly as Blackhawk took the box from Jack. “Do you already know what it contains?” Thor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackhawk shrugged. “It probably belonged to Anne,” he said. “And there might be something in here that tells us more about her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because there’s something she wants us to know, I take it,” Thor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent shrugged. “We see what we choose, and read what comes in life in the same manner,” he said with dispassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a lock on it,” Genevieve commented, peeling off her dive suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll take it back to the lab. There’s no reason to destroy something that’s hundreds of years old,” Thor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kidding,” Jack protested. “How can you stand it? So what if we break the lock?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not just treasure seeking. We’re preserving history,” Thor reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizzie popped up at the back of the boat, followed by Zach. Staring at them, she knew immediately that there had been another find. “I don’t believe it!” she cried. She looked at Genevieve and threw her a proud look. “You’re too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too much,” Thor murmured softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve walked past him. “We have some sodas in the ice chest, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cheer up. Celebrate,” Lizzie said as Zach cleared the dive platform. “We have someone who’s better than sonar. This is great,” Lizzie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer enthusiasm brought a smile to Genevieve’s lips. “Thank you, Lizzie.” She stared defiantly at Thor as she spoke\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from her and got on the radio. She heard him call the other boat. Jay’s voice crackled in return, but she knew what he had said from Thor’s reply. “Yep, it’s great. Genevieve homed right in and found a box. We’ll bring it in. Let’s call it quits for the day. With any luck, we’ll hear from Marshall soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little while later, back in at the dock, Genevieve was greeted with amazement and cheering from the rest of her teammates—and Nikki Blackhawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the other woman gave her a hug of congratulations, she whispered, “Don’t look so depressed. Shower, change, then Brent and I will meet you in the parking lot and we’ll go talk with Adam and Audrey. It’s going to be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be fine? Yeah, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced a smile. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki caught her by the shoulders, looking at her sternly. “Open up,” she said softly. “The ghost is trying to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That ghost is making me look crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki smiled and shrugged. “Ghosts will do that. I wish there had been a way for me to be the one diving with you, but we have to be careful. It won’t do any good if everyone knows who we are and why we’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped away quickly as Victor came up, lifting Genevieve, spinning her around. “Hon, you’ve just got to ditch that Norse god somehow and get back to being my partner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was general laughter all around, even Thor taking the comment good-naturedly. He even told Victor it was nice to be called a god. But then he turned away, saying he would take the box to the professor at the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve closed her eyes for a minute, feeling dizzy, then glad he hadn’t suggested that she accompany him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sped as quickly as she could manage from the docks, going to her own cottage, showering and changing with shaking hands and a trembling that wouldn’t leave. She dressed quickly, afraid that any minute Thor would be there, staring at her suspiciously, suggesting she come with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParadoxically, she felt a sinking fear that he would never appear again. That he might really see her the way she looked at an exotic jellyfish—gorgeous when billowing in the water, deadly when wrapping its tentacles around its prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t—wouldn’t—dwell on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raced out of her cottage, heading away from the tiki bar and toward the parking lot. No one else was there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she waited, a late afternoon cloud covered the sun. Darkness seemed to descend in a great, ominous swirl. Around her, palms whispered as they swayed in the rising breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gritted her teeth, fighting the sensation that she was being watched. That a predator was lurking behind the benign palms and sea grapes. But then she heard something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shifting. Something in the trees. As if an animal were stalking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes for an instant, trying to clear her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nearly screamed aloud when a voice said suddenly, “Hey there, gorgeous heroine of the deep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around. It was Jack. She was almost giddy with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack! Damn you, you startled me,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “What’s up? I should buy you a big bottle of champagne.” He cocked his head at an angle. “Or a beer?” he said hopefully. “Kind of surprised me that our mighty leader brought us in today. I have a feeling we’ll be working long, hard hours from here on out. So what do you say? Can I buy you a drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Jack. I’m meeting Audrey,” she said. “But how about a little later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got it. I’ll be hanging around in the usual places. Crook your little finger, and I’ll come running.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “Thanks, Jack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved to her and headed across the lot to the street beyond. As he disappeared into the crowd on the sidewalk, Brent and Nikki came forward. “Hey,” Nikki said cheerfully. She looped an arm through Genevieve’s. “Cheer up. You’re going to be rich and famous. Oops, wait a minute. Government funding. You’ll be kind of rich and famous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just want to be sane, she thought. And despite herself, that inner voice went on. Sane—and loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a reason why you’re seeing what you are,” Brent said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve flashed him a rueful smile. “Always?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “No. Sometimes, people are…well, just seeing what they want to see. That’s why we’re not easily accessible. Adam tries to make sure there’s really something going on before he calls in his people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, she felt there was something very solid—sane in the midst of insanity—about Brent Blackhawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. “So…do you see ghosts?” she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All the time,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at Nikki. “And you…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve seen them most of my life. Shadows, a hint of something.” It was her turn to hesitate ruefully. “They’ve only started talking to me recently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe late afternoon sun was shining down again, though the heat was beginning to ease. Duval Street was crowded with tourists, and competing music escaped from different bars on different corners. This seemed like the most ridiculous conversation in the world, coming in the daylight, among so many of the laughing, partying, vacationing…living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the alley to Audrey’s and turned. Adam Harrison was already there and opened the door for them. Apparently he knew his people well, because he greeted them warmly. Once again, Genevieve felt stronger in his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you!” Audrey called happily. When she entered her friend’s parlor, Genevieve saw computer printouts, magazines and books everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve been looking up everything we can find,” Adam explained. “About the attack on the Marie Josephine, the storm and the sinking. We’ve had a few minutes to speak, and Audrey has filled me in on what she knows. So I thought we should sit around and discuss what facts we have, add in what’s happening, and see what answers we get.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Genevieve found a box today, someone’s private little treasure chest. It was locked,” Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Adam said. “The ghost led you to it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She likes you,” Nikki said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” Genevieve muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She might have picked you because she knows you’re willing to help her,” Brent said. He paused, looking at her. “Some people have a sixth sense, if you will, though most people have a habit of denying it. Who thinks that someone who sees ghosts is sane? You’ve probably always had the ability to sense something beyond the usual, but it’s only just now that someone has tried to make contact. This ghost sees you as some kind of kindred spirit. It’s a good thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A good thing? She’s nearly given me a heart attack several times,” Genevieve protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but now you’re accustomed to her,” Brent said. He always spoke so evenly, in such a matter-of-fact tone. The ridiculous seemed to make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I don’t understand,” Nikki said, taking a seat and frowning as she picked up a batch of the papers, “is why Genevieve is seeing pirates. Supposedly the pirates survived and it was the ship’s crew that went down. What we know about what happened comes from the pirates’ letters and journals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that is interesting,” Adam agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then again,” Nikki said, “how do we know the ghost is from the Marie Josephine? The body of a murdered woman was found on the beach,” Nikki reminded them. She hesitated. “That means there might have been other victims. Other ghosts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see her?” Adam asked Nikki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki shook her head. “I wasn’t with Genevieve when we went down. We were lucky Thor Thompson even let us out on the dive. He knows we’re your people, Adam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam nodded gravely. “Well, she keeps showing Genevieve the pirate treasure. So let’s assume she is from the Marie Josephine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Genevieve, you’re going to think this is a bit schlocky, but we’re going to try a seance,” Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A seance?” Genevieve said weakly. The idea terrified her. “Um…it’s still light out,” she murmured. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vision-harrison-investigation-3/page-34.html","bookId":2269,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:01 PM"}
