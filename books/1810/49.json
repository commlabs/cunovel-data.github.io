And that he married a woman who looks freakishly identical to Kate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNope—don’t even care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give his back a congratulatory smack. “You and . . .” I . . . pat her head. “Both of you. Congratulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I realize I still have no idea where the hell Kate is. I hook my thumb toward the door. “I gotta go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs fast as my feet can carry me, I dash out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping out of the bedroom into the living area feels similar to when Dorothy stepped out of her dilapidated house into Oz. Everything is too bright, too colorful . . . too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew and Delores sit close together on the couch, under a beige blanket, sharing a bowl of cereal and watching Gilligan’s Island on TV. Matthew chuckles at the television before Dee feeds him a scoop of Froot Loops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I step into the room, Matthew’s attention turns to me. “You’re alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores is disappointed. “Damn it. I was hoping we’d have to get your stomach pumped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew tugs her strawberry-blond ponytail and tells her firmly, “I told you to be nice from now on. Cut that shit out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turns back to me, Delores sticks her tongue out at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ecstatic adrenaline rush from learning I did not actually put my dick in a pu**y that wasn’t Kate’s is starting to wear off. My head and stomach resume the nauseating symphony of a mighty hangover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub my temples and inform Matthew and Dee, “You know Billy got married last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn unison, they respond wearily, “Yep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To a stripper he’s known for less than twenty-four hours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I think I already know the answer, I ask the third-stupidest question ever: “Did he get her to sign a prenup?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores scoffs, “I’m not sure my cousin knows how to spell prenup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey seem way too calm about this development. “Why didn’t you stop him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Dee glares at me. “Are you f**king kidding me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew explains, “Drew, it was your idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face goes slack. “It was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was. After you woke up from your nosedive at the strip club, you went on and on about how great marriage is. How everyone should get f**king married. How love is a precious, beautiful flower, and marriage is the water and sunlight that helps it grow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seriously need to never drink again. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew nods. “You were very poetic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit. We should call Wilson—he’s the best divorce lawyer in New York City.” And an old colleague of my mother’s. “Maybe he can draft something that’ll work retroactively.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew takes another bite of cereal. “Already left him a message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers move from my temples to my forehead, continuing to rub the torturous pounding. “What else am I missing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the last thing you remember?” Matthew asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um . . . playing poker with you and Steven at Paradise. Warren singing Barry Manilow onstage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best friend laughs. “You’re missing a lot.” He sets the bowl of cereal down on the coffee table and elaborates. “Kate, Dee, Lexi, and Erin decided to crash our party and showed up at Paradise. After we left the police station—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him right off. “Why were we at the police station?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because that’s where they take you when you get arrested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We got arrested?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins. “Oh, no—we didn’t get arrested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee raises her hand. “We did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes go wide. “Kate was in jail?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew waves his hand calmly. “Only for, like, twenty minutes. They released the girls to our custody—no charges were filed. I smoothed things over with the strip club.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing with the usual-suspect line of thought, I turn on Delores. “What did you do to get Kate arrested?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just laughs. “You can thank your sister for that one—Alexandra didn’t appreciate her husband getting so much attention from the strippers. When one of them got in her face, Lexi showed her what was up—and the rest of us had her back. I’ll say this much: for a trust-fund baby, the Bitch has got a mean right hook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not news to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus Christ,” I sigh. “All right, forget all that—just tell me where Kate is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee looks confused. “What do you mean? She’s in your room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can point out that Kate is not, in fact, in our room, one of the bedroom doors opens. Erin steps out, wrapped in a fluffy bathrobe, her hair wet. “Good morning, everyone!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, naughty girl,” Dee greets her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin steps into the kitchen. “Mmm . . . coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd prepare to have your mind blown—because in the bedroom doorway Erin just exited appears none other than . . . Jack O’Shay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirtless. Wearing only boxers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretches his arms wide above his head with a yawn, then scratches his chest and adjusts his balls. “What a great f**king night, huh? I’m actually sad you’re only getting married once, Evans. I could definitely do that again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease look closely at my face. Did my eyeballs fall out of my head? ’Cause it feels like they have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Matthew. He just nods and flicks his hand, silently telling me, What are you gonna do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Erin sticks her head into the refrigerator behind us, Jack stands next to me. In a low voice I ask, “Did you . . . is this . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this what you think it is?” He grins like a well-fed feline. “It is, and I did.” Then, softer, he says, “Erin’s a wildcat, man. Easily made the top three bangs of my lifetime. I’ll fill you in later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this ends up causing Erin to not be my secretary in the near future—I’m going to have to kill Jack. Seriously. I can always find more friends. Finding a secretary who knows her shit as well as Erin does? That’ll be much more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin comes back into the room sipping her coffee. Jack grabs a newspaper off the table and announces, “I’ll be in the john.” Before he goes, he adds, “Hey, Erin—how about you bring me a cup of coffee for when I get out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin smiles sweetly. “Hey, Jack—how about you get it yourself? This isn’t the office, and even if it was, I don’t work for you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4/page-49.html","bookId":1810,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM"}
