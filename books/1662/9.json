The central air was blowing heat from the vents, but I was shivering uncontrollably as I sat on the recliner. “I was planning on telling you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were?” Daemon stood in front of me, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. “When, exactly? Before or after you did something that puts you at risk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched. “I didn’t plan on this happening! All I wanted was to have a normal afternoon with a boy—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With a boy?” he spat, eyes flaring an intense green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, with a normal boy!” Why did that sound so surprising? I took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I did plan on coming to you tonight, but Blake asked me to grab something to eat with him and I just wanted one freaking afternoon with someone like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis frown went so deep I thought his face would crack. “You have friends who are normal, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not the same thing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon seemed to get what I wasn’t really saying. For a second, his eyes widened and I’d swear there was a flicker of pain in them, but then it was gone. “Tell me what’s been happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt shot through me, pulling behind it spiky barbs that dug in deep. “I think I did get alien cooties, because I’ve been moving things…without touching them. Today, I opened the door to Mr. Garrison’s classroom without touching it. He seemed to think it was a drafty hallway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How often has this been happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On and off for around a week. The first time it was my locker door, but I thought it was a fluke, so I didn’t say anything. Then I thought about wanting a glass of tea, and the glass flew out of the cabinet and the tea started pouring itself in the fridge. The shower turned itself on, doors opened, and a couple of times, clothes flew from my closet.” I sighed. “My room was a mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snicker escaped. “Nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands balled into fists. “How can you think this is funny? Look at what happened today! I didn’t mean to stop the branch! I mean, I didn’t want it to hit him, but I didn’t consciously stop the damn thing. The whole healing-me thing—it changed me, Daemon. If you haven’t guessed it yet, I couldn’t move things before. And I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I get a splitting headache and feel exhausted afterward. What if I’m dying or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon blinked and was suddenly beside me, sitting on the arm of the chair. Our legs touched. His breath stirred my hair. I shrank back as my heart rate picked up. “Why do you have to move so fast? It’s…wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “Sorry, Kitten. For us, moving fast is natural. It’s actually more effort to slow down and appear ’normal,’ as you put it. I guess I just forget I have to pretend around you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart ached. Why did everything I say lately come out as a criticism?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not dying,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes latched onto mine. “Because I’d never let that happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said it so strongly that I believed him. “What if I’m turning into an alien?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look crossed his face, like he wanted to laugh, and I could get why. It did sound absurd. “I don’t know if that’s possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Moving stuff with my mind shouldn’t be possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “Why didn’t you tell me when this first happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I said, unable to look away. “I should’ve. I don’t want to put you guys at risk. I swear I’m not doing it on purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon leaned back. His pupils turned luminous. “I know you aren’t doing anything on purpose. I wouldn’t have thought that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught as he held my gaze with his strange eyes. The prickly feeling was back, spreading over my skin. Every inch of me became painfully aware of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a moment. “I don’t know if it was a product of my healing you those times or when you connected with us during Baruck’s attack. Either way, it’s obvious that you’re using some of my abilities. I’ve never heard of this happening before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t heal humans.” Daemon paused, pursing his lips. “I’ve always thought it had something to do with exposing our abilities, but now I’m wondering if it’s more than that. If the real reason is because we…change humans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. “So I am turning into an alien?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kitten…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I could think about was the movie Alien and that thing crawling out of the dude’s stomach, except mine would be a glowing ball of light or something. “How do we stop this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stood. “I want to try something, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows rose. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing his eyes, he let out a long breath. His form flickered and faded. A few seconds later, he was in his true form, radiating a powerful red-white light. He was shaped like a human, and I knew he would be warm to touch. It was still strange seeing him like this. It drove home the point—the one I forgot sometimes—that he wasn’t from this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay something to me, his voice whispered in my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their true form, Luxen don’t speak out loud. “Uh, hi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chuckle tickled inside me. Not aloud. Say something to me, but not out loud. Like what happened in the clearing. You spoke to me then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he’d been healing me, I’d heard his thoughts. Would it happen again? Your light is really pretty, but it’s blinding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard his ghost inhale. We can still hear each other. His light dimmed, and he was standing in front of me again, solid, eyes troubled. “So my light was blinding you, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it was.” I fiddled with the chain around my neck. “Am I glowing now?” It usually happened when they went into their true form, leaving a faint trace behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that had changed, too. “Why can I still hear you? You act like I shouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t, but we’re still connected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, how do we get unconnected?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a good question.” He stretched idly as his gaze roamed across the room. “You have books everywhere, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s really not important right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hand outstretched. A book flew off the arm of the couch and into his hand. As he turned it over, his brows rose and his gaze moved over it quickly. “His touch kills? Really, what is this stuff you’re reading?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot from the chair, snatching the book away and holding it close to my chest. “Shut up. I love this book.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh huh,” Daemon murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, back to the important stuff. And stop touching my books.” I set it back where I’d left it. “What are we going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze settled on me. “I’ll figure out what is happening with you. Just give me some time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, hoping we had enough time. There was no telling what I’d accidentally do next, and the last thing I wanted was to expose Dee and the others. “You do realize this whole thing is why you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s why you suddenly like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m pretty sure I liked you before this, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you had one hell of a way of showing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True,” he admitted. “And I’ve already said I’m sorry for the way I treated you.” He took a fortifying breath. “I always liked you. From the moment you first flipped me off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you didn’t start to want to spend time with me until after the first attack, when you healed me. Maybe we were already starting to, like…morph together or whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon frowned. “What is it with you? It’s like you need to convince yourself I can’t possibly like you. Does doing that make it easier to tell yourself you don’t have feelings for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You treated me like a red-headed stepchild for months. I’m sorry if I have a hard time believing that whatever you feel is real.” I sat on the couch. “And it has nothing to do with what I feel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders tensed. “Do you like that guy you were with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blake? I don’t know. He’s nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was sitting with you today at lunch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brow arched. “Because there was an open seat and it’s a free world where people can pick where they want to sit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were other seats open. He could’ve sat anywhere else in the cafeteria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a few seconds to respond. “He’s in my bio class. Maybe he just felt comfortable with me, because we’re both sort of new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered across his face, and then he was standing in front of me. “He kept staring at you. And obviously he wanted to spend time with you outside of school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he likes me,” I said, shrugging. “Lesa invited him to the party on Friday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s eyes darkened to an evergreen. “I don’t think you should be hanging around him until we know what’s up with you moving stuff. You doing that thing with the branch was only one instance. We can’t have a repeat of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? I’m not supposed to date or hang out with anyone now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon smiled. “Anyone human, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” I shook my head, standing. “This is a stupid conversation. I’m not dating anyone anyway, but if I were, I wouldn’t stop just because you said so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t?” His hand shot out, tucking back a strand of hair behind my ear. “We’ll just have to see about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped sideways, keeping distance between us. “There’s nothing to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChallenge filled his eyes. “If you say so, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolding my arms, I sighed. “This isn’t a game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but if it were, I’d win.” He flickered out and appeared by the entrance to the foyer. “By the way, I’ve heard what Simon has been saying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat swept over my face. Another problem, but less important in the grand scheme of things. “Yeah, he’s being a douche. I think it’s his friends. He actually apologized to me, and then when his friends showed up, he told them I was trying to get with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s eyes narrowed. “That’s not okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. “It’s no big deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not to you, but it is to me.” He paused, his shoulders squaring. “I’ll take care of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t get much sleep that night, so trig the next day sucked worse than normal. There was a six-foot-three alien behind me. Not talking to me, just breathing softly against the back of my neck. And no matter how far I scooted up, I could still feel him. I was hyperaware of him—when he moved, when he wrote something down, when he scratched his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway through class, I debated making a run for the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-9.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
