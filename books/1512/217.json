However, team China ended with a negative 4 score so the it deducted 8000 points.

It didn\u0027t look as obvious as the one on his clone, just a faint red line. He did it to remember everything, to revive his comrades, for revenge, and to never experience the same thing again.

He calculated the time needed. It would take two to three months to excavate the collapsed tomb. Which meant that he needed 5000 points to get the Book of Amun-Ra in addition to the points needed to revive his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimension was unusually quiet at this time. The usual scene of people eating and chatting on the platform was gone. However, those scenes still seemed to waver in front of him. He felt his heart tearing apart every time he imagined their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng told Lori the events in the movies for the first time. She was the only one he could talk to now. It was also to calm her down. She experienced an unimaginable fear when the girls of HongLu and ChengXiao created suddenly disappeared. So Zheng had to tell her what happened in the last movie. Though he didn\u0027t say what happened to his clone. This was the secret between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his surprise, Lori analyzed for him calmly. \"You said there\u0027s a less expensive method to revive?

In the movie, they can revive a person with the spell from the Book of the Dead, a person\u0027s body and organs, and a human sacrifice. But we have tried, and there is no such spell in the Book of the Dead. So this book is just a weapon to us. The Book of Amun-Ra is probably the key to resurrection. Reviving at the altar needs the body, organs, 7000 points, and a rank B reward. So if we want to revive Heng, we can create his body without a mind, which takes 500 points. Then bring him into the altar and revive using the Book of Amun-Ra. This is the only method I can think of. Everyone has one chance to be revived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLori said. \"You have the rewards but not enough points. It takes 4-5000 points to dig up the Book of Amun-Ra. Furthermore, you have to prepare for the next movie.

There\u0027s also something I want to verify. If my clone became so strong after just two movies, then what I am thinking may be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLori walked over to Zheng and stared at him. \"Can you bring me into The Mummy?

He stared at this pretty yet young face, the face he loved the most. As long as she was by his side, his heart wouldn\u0027t fall to darkness. He could imagine the reason his clone became the way he was, was because the light that kept him afloat had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.

He spent a whole day searching through the exchange system and organize what weapons he could exchange. Due to the lack of points, exchanged weapons that required higher rewards and lower points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t sleep with Lori for the night. He sat in the platform doing some calculations until Lori came out from the room.

I realized how much we are lacking after the battle with team Devil. To be specific, we are lacking the systematic knowledge of Xuan. Even though HongLu was smart but he was not specialized in battle strategies and survival. A horror movie requires too much knowledge, one important aspect is transportation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The movies can be separated into two categories, happening in a confined space and large open space. You must have a transportation tool for large space movies. I have checked the Sky Stick from the exchange system. It costs 4500 points and a rank B reward, able to carry one ton, has 12 air to ground missiles, 5000 rounds of machine gun ammunition, a flame thrower, and lighting capability. It\u0027s a great all around tool and can reach up to 1,000 km per hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then took out the hoverboard he obtained from team Devil. \"This one was worse in contrast. It only contains 8 air to ground missiles, no machine gun, no flame thrower, and only has a speed of 700 km per hour. This is probably gear manufactured by clone Xuan. After reviving everyone, we need to equip each person with one. Team Devil actually appeared very far from us in Resident Evil.

Then Zheng laughed. \"I learned a lot about this world from team Devil. First is the resurrection. Secondly is what I have to confirm in The Mummy this time, and third is completing missions in the movies proactively and not just the main mission forced on by God. Thanks to my clone, I will try my best to do it in the next movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-empty\u003d\"true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLori smiled. \"You changed a lot.

I entered the third stage to simulate Xuan to analyze and organize the information. He will be the first one I have to revive.
