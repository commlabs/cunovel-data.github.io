{"id":64471,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"\u003cp\u003eOilstar\u0027s security squads grudgingly did what their boss had ordered, but McKendry noticed without surprise that they walked their routes together, sticking to the brightly lit decks, chatting with late-shift crewmen - in other words, going out of their way to avoid anywhere that trouble might occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man patrolled the darker ways himself, slipping through the claustrophobic and tangled pipe forests and chemical-storage areas, letting a sixth sense prickle his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up into the dark and moonless sky, he was positive this uneasiness wasn\u0027t his imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he had been just as positive month after month, ever since the night Joshua Keene had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis doubts ended when he reached the fourth deck and stopped, feeling electricity go up his spine. Someone - perhaps a survivor from Green Impact - was here on theValhalla platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis flashlight beam revealed no movement in the dark corners; not that he expected any. No professional would have waited around. Then he discovered that one of the access hatches leading up from the support legs and the distant water was open. It was near the central wellhead and the shut- down mechanical shops. When he examined it more closely, he saw that one of the naked yellow lightbulbs had been smashed. Crumpled in the shadows, he found a lightweight black cloak - the kind he himself would have chosen for camouflage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever had been here, or was still here, apparently thought that security on board was as lax as it had been in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe directed the beam of the flashlight all the way down to the water. Though the beam diffused, he saw something dark tied up to the ladder attached to the wide concrete leg. Running to the nearest lift platform, he descended to water level, where he studied the unobtrusive black boat tied to a ladder rung. The single rubber raft could have carried only a few of the terrorists, but even a small group could cause extreme damage to the rig if they knew what they were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry took out a knife and, with a quick motion, slashed the rope holding the Zodiac in place. He shoved with his foot so that the raft drifted into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever had come to his rig wouldn\u0027t get away now. He\u0027d have them cornered on theValhalla platform, where he could deal with them in his own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreeping across the decks and ducking the rig\u0027s still laughable security, Keene found a set of lockers that contained Oilstar work clothes. Diligent practices on the rig had been increased, and he thought he saw more guards on patrol, but they didn\u0027t appear to be doing a better job than before. They talked loudly and walked in packs, making it easy for him to elude them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom one of the lockers, he pulled on a greasy, thick jumpsuit that had the hand-lettered name Virata written on the left breast in bold strokes with a black Magic Marker. The jumpsuit smelled like grease and piss, but he\u0027d endured worse. He found a hard hat adorned with crudely placed racing decals and snugged it against his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking away from the lockers he was less stealthy, and instead walked as if he belonged on the rig. The explosive packs strapped to his chest and legs, as well as the packages he carried in one hand, made him look bulky and cumbersome, but if all went well, he wouldn\u0027t have them for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the mechanical rooms and shop offices, he found the central pipes and controls for the fire- suppression systems and alarms. He was relieved to see that the safety valves were split into two systems, one of which went toward the habitation quarters to protect the crew complement. An independent set dealt with the production facility, the pipes and chambers and machinery of the production rig itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut down, then permanently disabled the alarms, sprinklers, and safety systems in the production portions ofValhalla . Once the explosives went off, the alarms and sprinklers would activate inside the habitation module, getting the snoozing off-duty teams out of bed. That would give the crew members a chance to get away, but nothing would stop the flames in the production area. These sleepy South American crewmen certainly wouldn\u0027t try to save the rig. They\u0027d rush to the lifeboats, which would drop like padded sledgehammers into the water far below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene supposed that kept him from being a cold-blooded murderer; now he qualified as just a warm- blooded one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worked for ten minutes setting up his explosives against a thirty-foot-high distillation tank connected to three systems that led to the heavy-gases storage chambers and out to the flame boom. His examination of design blueprints of theValhalla had showed that even his token amount of explosives would ignite this one tank. Once it blew, it would set off the second, which would set off the third, and so on like red-hot dominoes until nothing was left of the oil rig\u0027s production facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a huge supply of Oilstar funding, Van Alman might be able to repair and eventually restart production on theValhalla . But the cost to him in damage to public relations would be insurmountable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene twisted the last wire onto the timer. He still had a few small grenades clipped to his belt, just in case he needed a little help getting away. If he got out of here and climbed down to his inflatable boat in time, he could roar off in the Zodiac with the outboard cranked full. With the rig blazing behind him, he could make his way back to the Venezuelan mainland and eventually return to North America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year he\u0027d have one hell of a story to tell the remaining members of the Daredevils Club on New Year\u0027s Eve. He would take great pleasure in rubbing Frik\u0027s nose in it. First he had to finish his job and get off the rig alive, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up. Before he could turn, there was a click as the hammer of a pistol was drawn back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene froze. Thoughts raced through his mind. He hadn\u0027t even heard footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe background white noise of the drilling rig showered like snow around him. He rested a hand on one of the small grenades at his waist, cradling it. He could easily yank the pin out, toss it next to the other explosives. The grenade would blow up before the security guard behind him could stop it. The only problem was that he would be gunned down in an instant, or the explosion would take him with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered trying to bluff his way out, holding on to the grenade as long as possible. If he could redirect the guard\u0027s attention, maybe he could toss the grenade far enough so that he could get away as the explosions rippled through the rig. In the meantime, he would have to dodge bullets, too. It was a near-zero chance of survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut near-zero isn\u0027t zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around very slowly and show me your hands,\" the security guard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in the voice tickled the back of Keene\u0027s memory, but he tried to ignore it and stay focused on the mission. He turned, keeping his eyes fixed on the explosives and his hand covering the grenade. Maybe he could fool the guard, act like a regular Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to set a smile on his face and looked up to make eye contact with the stranger. When he did, he saw the impossible: Terris McKendry, very much alive, aiming a pistol at his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene blinked. McKendry\u0027s face looked like an astonished child\u0027s as his jaw fell open. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupefied, Keene almost dropped the grenade. The motion startled McKendry, who jerked the pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvoluntarily, Keene ducked. \"You\u0027re dead,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry looked at his friend as if that were the stupidest thing he had ever heard, but he clamped his lips shut. Keene knew that the same words had been about to come from the other man\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watched you die,\" the bigger man said. \"Blown overboard. They never found your body. The sharks got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the bullets hit. I saw you thrown off the bicycle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment the two men held their weapons, facing each other. Keene kept his hand on the grenade; McKendry\u0027s pistol was still targeted at his partner. Finally Joshua laughed out loud, the braying chuckle that had always annoyed his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" McKendry lowered his weapon a fraction of an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene tucked the grenade in his jumpsuit pocket. \"What areyou doing here, Terris? Helping out those bastards at Oilstar?\" He raised his hands to indicate the totality of theValhalla platform. \"Don\u0027t you know what Frik did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you doing the dirty work of those Green Impact scum, Josh? Selene Trujold has the blood of dozens on her hands. Probably more. You saw yourself what she did to the crew on the tanker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Keene said, uneasy. \"But I also saw what an Oilstar assassination squad did to her and all the other members of her team; slaughtered most of them and sent the rest off to rot in some Venezuelan jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry turned gray. \"You were there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was off in Pedernales getting supplies. When I came back, I found the camp destroyed. Selene died in my arms.\" He gritted his teeth. \"Damn it, Terris! I loved her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would have killed you eventually. Maybe I saved your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a killer, Joshua. A mad dog, willing to murder innocent people to make her point. I had to shoot her.\" McKendry sounded as if he were working as hard to convince himself as he was to convince Keene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re full of shit, Terris,\" Keene said. \"She wasn\u0027t shot, she was stabbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean she was stabbed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean she was stabbed. With this.\" He pulled the knife from his waist and held it pommel-out to his partner. The etched initials J.R. caught the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene couldn\u0027t figure out his partner\u0027s reaction. \"I picked it up from the pool of Selene\u0027s blood that she dropped it in. Terris, what is your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man\u0027s pallor had improved. He shook his head and stood up straight, as if a large weight had been removed from his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene knew better than to push the subject. He sheathed the knife and said, \"Did you ever stop to wonder about the real reason Frik wanted this artifact?\" He grabbed Selene\u0027s fragment out of his pocket and held it up. At times, he had wanted to wipe the surfaces clean, to remove the discolorations, but instead he had let the bloodstains dry on it. Selene\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry stared at the object. Keene dangled it like a carrot in front of his friend\u0027s eyes. \"Yes, I got it, Terris. I also found out why Frik really wants it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rapidly summarized what he had learned: Paul Trujold\u0027s discovery of the artifact\u0027s true power, and the real purpose behind Frikkie\u0027s Daredevil scheme - knowledge that had cost Selene\u0027s father his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene watched McKendry absorb the information, run it through his logic filters. He knew McKendry\u0027s process, knew his partner would come to the same conclusions he himself had reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, in a lowered voice, McKendry said, \"If it were anybody else telling me this, I wouldn\u0027t even listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it is me, Terris. Damn it, it\u0027s the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry gestured with the pistol, not in a threatening manner, just as the most obvious means to point. \"I think you\u0027d better disassemble those explosives. You won\u0027t be needing them now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene hesitated, feeling his heart turn to lead in his chest. \"I promised Selene,\" he said. \"With her dying breath she asked me to shut down Oilstar, to get even with them. I can\u0027t ignore that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I gave my word to protect this platform. It may not be worth what I thought it was, but I won\u0027t let you destroy theValhalla .\" He paused. \"There\u0027s got to be some other way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men held their ground, each waiting for the other to speak or offer a suggestion. After a minute, Keene said, \"Crap. Maybe I don\u0027t have to blow up theValhalla to be true to my promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short time later, the two men stood side by side at the edge of the heliport deck, high above the water. McKendry\u0027s on-duty security men had encountered them and waved at their chief. They had not bothered to question the identity of the man wearing Virata\u0027s work overalls. McKendry growled under his breath; Keene snickered at their incompetence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smaller man held the odd artifact that had been excavated from deep beneath the sea. He stared at it for the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure wish I understood what this is,\" he said. \"But I know it\u0027s not worth all the grief it\u0027s caused.\" He held it high, dangling it more than a hundred feet over the waters of the Gulf of Paria, and thought of his promise to Selene. Frik Van Alman would be more upset about not regaining the artifact than he would ever have been about losing the oil rig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at the thought of his revenge, muttered something under his breath, and let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the artifact droped from his fingers, it reflected the lights of the rig oddly, as if the perspective were wrong. The optical illusion made it appear to hang in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry\u0027s big hand reached out in a flash and grabbed the object before it could fall to the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That wouldn\u0027t finish it, Joshua.\" Keene glared at his friend, feeling betrayed, but McKendry continued. \"Frik would find it. Somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous. He couldn\u0027t know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything is possible. He could have a camera on us right at this moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene didn\u0027t answer. McKendry grinned. \"I\u0027ve reduced you to silence. That\u0027s a change. Listen to me, would you? Getting rid of this would not make Frik stop what he\u0027s doing. You said yourself this thing could make internal combustion engines a distant memory. That would destroy Oilstar, destroy Frikkie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if he comes after it before then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t,\" McKendry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he trusts us to be good soldiers and do as we were told. On New Year\u0027s Eve, you and I will go to Las Vegas and make Frik answer for himself. We\u0027ll see to it that this discovery gets put to good use for the whole world, not just for one greedy son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene sighed and stared out at the water and the nearby coast of Trinidad. The sky was lightening, shifting from indigo to blues and grays and pinks as the first rays of the sun refracted through the gathering clouds. Red sky at morning, he thought. A storm was on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always did hate loose ends,\" he said, turning to face his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry didn\u0027t so much as crack a smile. \"And you always did talk too much.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-39.html","bookId":1691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM"}
