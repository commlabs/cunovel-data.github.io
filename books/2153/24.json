You say the Sardaukar accounted for another twenty thousand, possibly a few more. And I\u0027ve seen the transportation manifests for their return from Arrakis. If they killed twenty thousand, they lost almost five for one. Why won\u0027t you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: \"This is your job, Mentat. What do they mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave you Duncan Idaho\u0027s head count on the sietch he visited,\" Hawat said. \"It all fits. If they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities, their population would be about five million. My best estimate is that they had at least twice that many communities. You scatter your population on such a planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten million?\" The Baron\u0027s jowls quivered with amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron pursed his fat lips. The beady eyes stared without wavering at Hawat. Is this true Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this be and no one suspect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t even cut heavily into their birth-rate-growth figure,\" Hawat said. \"We\u0027ve just weeded out some of their less successful specimens, leaving the strong to grow stronger - just like on Salusa Secundus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Salusa Secundus!\" the Baron barked. \"What has this to do with the Emperor\u0027s prison planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most others,\" Hawat said. \"When you add the very best of military training - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense! By your argument, I could recruit from among the Fremen after the way they\u0027ve been oppressed by my nephew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat spoke in a mild voice: \"Don\u0027t you oppress any of your troops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . I . . . but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oppression is a relative thing,\" Hawat said. \"Your fighting men are much better off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant alternative to being soldiers of the Baron, heh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities - had Rabban unwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently he said: \"How could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength,\" Hawat said. \"I\u0027d remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a training cadre of people who understood their background, preferably people who had preceded them from the same oppressive situation. Then I\u0027d fill them with the mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to produce just such superior beings as themselves. And all the while, I\u0027d show them what such superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine mansions . . . whatever they desired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron began to nod. \"The way the Sardaukar live at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa Secundus is justified because it produced them - the elite. The commonest Sardaukar trooper lives a life, in many respects, as exalted as that of any member of a Great House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such an idea!\" the Baron whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You begin to share my suspicions,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did such a thing start?\" the Baron asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa Secundus before the Emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there? Even the Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions are not encouraged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron\u0027s eyes glazed with thought. \"Yes, a very carefully kept secret. They\u0027d use every device of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, what\u0027s there to conceal?\" Hawat asked. \"That the Padishah Emperor has a prison planet? Everyone knows this. That he has - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Count Fenring!\" the Baron blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. \"What of Count Fenring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At my nephew\u0027s birthday several years ago,\" the Baron said. \"This Imperial popinjay. Count Fenring, came as official observer and to . . . ah, conclude a business arrangement between the Emperor and myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . ah, during one of our conversations, I believe I said something about making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say exactly?\" Hawat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly? That was quite a while ago and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord Baron, if you wish to make the best use of my services, you must give me adequate information. Wasn\u0027t this conversation recorded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron\u0027s face darkened with anger. \"You\u0027re as bad as Piter! I don\u0027t like these - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piter is no longer with you my Lord,\" Hawat said. \"As to that, whatever did happen to Piter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He became too familiar, too demanding of me,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You assure me you don\u0027t waste a useful man,\" Hawat said. \"Will you waste me by threats and quibbling? We were discussing what you said to Count Fenring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, the Baron composed his features. When the time comes , he thought, I\u0027ll remember his manner with me. Yes. I will remember .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment,\" the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his great hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood. \"I said something like this,\" the Baron said. \"The Emperor knows a certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business.\u0027 I was referring to our work force losses. Then I said something about considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem and I said the Emperor\u0027s prison planet inspired me to emulate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witch blood!\" Hawat snapped. \"What did Fenring say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s when he began questioning me about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. \"So that\u0027s why they started looking into Arrakis,\" he said. \"Well, the thing\u0027s done.\" He opened his eyes. \"They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But certainly my innocent suggestion that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing is innocent in an Emperor\u0027s eyes! What were your instructions to Rabban?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat shook his head. \"You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill off the natives, wipe them out entirely, or - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waste an entire work force?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a curettement, scrape out Giedi Prime like a hollow gourd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron studied his Mentat, then: \"He wouldn\u0027t dare!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron\u0027s lips quivered. \"What is your alternative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abandon your dear nephew, Rabban.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aband . . . \" The Baron broke off, stared at Hawat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him no more troops, no aid of any kind. Don\u0027t answer his messages other than to say you\u0027ve heard of the terrible way he\u0027s handled things on Arrakis and you intend to take corrective measures as soon as you\u0027re able. I\u0027ll arrange to have some of your messages intercepted by Imperial spies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what of the spice, the revenues, the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Demand your baronial profits, but be careful how you make your demands. Require fixed sums of Rabban. We can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron turned his hands palms up. \"But how can I be certain that my weasel nephew isn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We still have our spies on Arrakis. Tell Rabban he either meets the spice quotas you set him or he\u0027ll be replaced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know my nephew,\" the Baron said. \"This would only make him oppress the population even more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he will!\" Hawat snapped. \"You don\u0027t want that stopped now! You merely want your own hands clean. Let Rabban make your Salusa Secundus for you. There\u0027s no need even to send him any prisoners. He has all the population required. If Rabban is driving his people to meet your spice quotas, then the Emperor need suspect no other motive. That\u0027s reason enough for putting the planet on the rack. And you, Baron, will not show by word or action that there\u0027s any other reason for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice. \"Ah, Hawat, you are a devious one. Now, how do we move into Arrakis and make use of what Rabban prepares?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the simplest thing of all, Baron. If you set each year\u0027s quota a bit higher than the one before, matters will soon reach a head there. Production will drop off. You can remove Rabban and take over yourself . . . to correct the mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It fits,\" the Baron said. \"But I can feel myself tiring of all this. I\u0027m preparing another to take over Arrakis for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat studied the fat round face across from him. Slowly the old soldier-spy began to nod his head. \"Feyd-Rautha,\" he said. \"So that\u0027s the reason for the oppression now. You\u0027re very devious yourself, Baron. Perhaps we can incorporate these two schemes. Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can go to Arrakis as their savior. He can win the populace. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron smiled. And behind his smile, he asked himself: Now, how does this fit in with Hawat\u0027s personal scheming?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hawat, seeing that he was dismissed, arose and left the red-walled room. As he walked, he could not put down the disturbing unknowns that cropped into every computation about Arrakis. This new religious leader that Gurney Halleck hinted at from his hiding place among the smugglers, this Muad\u0027Dib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I should not have told the Baron to let this religion flourish where it will, even among the folk of pan and graben , he told himself. But it\u0027s well known that repression makes a religion flourish .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought about Halleck\u0027s reports on Fremen battle tactics. The tactics smacked of Halleck himself . . . and Idaho . . . and even of Hawat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Idaho survive? he asked himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was a futile question. He did not yet ask himself if it was possible that Paul had survived. He knew the Baron was convinced that all Atreides were dead. The Bene Gesserit witch had been his weapon, the Baron admitted. And that could only mean an end to all - even to the woman\u0027s own son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a poisonous hate she must\u0027ve had for the Atreides , he thought. Something like the hate I hold for this Baron. Will my blow be as final and complete as hers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"The Collected Sayings of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul-Muad\u0027Dib remembered that there had been a meal heavy with spice essence. He clung to this memory because it was an anchor point and he could tell himself from this vantage that his immediate experience must be a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a theater of processes , he told himself. I am a prey to the imperfect vision, to the race consciousness and its terrible purpose .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, he could not escape the fear that he had somehow overrun himself, lost his position in time, so that past and future and present mingled without distinction. It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was in itself a thing intrinsically of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChani prepared the meal for me , he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Chani was deep in the south - in the cold country where the sun was hot - secreted in one of the new sietch strongholds, safe with their son, Leto II.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, was that a thing yet to happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he reassured himself, for Alia-the-Strange-One, his sister, had gone there with his mother and with Chani - a twenty-thumper trip into the south, riding a Reverend Mother\u0027s palanquin fixed to the back of a wild maker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shied away from thought of riding the giant worms, asking himself: Or is Alia yet to be born?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on razzia , Paul recalled. We went raiding to recover the water of our dead in Arrakeen. And I found the remains of my father in the funeral pyre. I enshrined the skull of my father in a Fremen rock mound overlooking Harg Pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was that a thing yet to be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wounds are real , Paul told himself. My scars are real. The shrine of my father\u0027s skull is real .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill in the dreamlike state, Paul remembered that Harah, Jamis\u0027 wife, had intruded on him once to say there\u0027d been a fight in the sietch corridor. That had been the interim sietch before the women and children had been sent into the deep south. Harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner chamber, the black wings of her hair tied back by water rings on a chain. She had held aside the chamber\u0027s hangings and told him that Chani had just killed someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis happened , Paul told himself. This was real, not born out of its time and subject to change .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul remembered he had rushed out to find Chani standing beneath the yellow globes of the corridor, clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe with hood thrown back, a flush of exertion on her elfin features. She had been sheathing her crysknife. A huddled group had been hurrying away down the corridor with a burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Paul remembered telling himself: You always know when they\u0027re carrying a body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChani\u0027s water rings, worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck, tinkled as she turned toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chani, what is this?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat, Usul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But perhaps I should\u0027ve left him for Harah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(And Paul recalled how the faces of the people around them had showed appreciation for these words. Even Harah had laughed.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he came to challenge me! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trained me yourself in the weirding way, Usul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly! But you shouldn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was born in the desert, Usul. I know how to use a crysknife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suppressed his anger, tried to talk reasonably. \"This may all be true, Chani, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am no longer a child hunting scorpions in the sietch by the light of a handglobe, Usul. I do not play games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul glared at her, caught by the odd ferocity beneath her casual attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was not worthy, Usul,\" Chani said. \"I\u0027d not disturb your meditations with the likes of him.\" She moved closer, looking at him out of the corners of her eyes, dropping her voice so that only he might hear. \"And, beloved, when it\u0027s learned that a challenger may face me and be brought to shameful death by Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s woman, there\u0027ll be fewer challengers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes , Paul told himself, that had certainly happened. It was true-past. And the number of challengers testing the new blade of Muad\u0027Dib did drop dramatically .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, in a world not-of-the-dream, there was a hint of motion, the cry of a nightbird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dream , Paul reassured himself. It\u0027s the spice meal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered it if might be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world where the Fremen believed he had his true existence - into the alam al-mithal, the world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations were removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In the landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say: \"I am I because I am here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother had said once: \"The people are divided, some of them, in how they think of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must be waking from the dream , Paul told himself. For this had happened - these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of the Fremen, these words had passed through reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the Fremen, Paul knew. She didn\u0027t like the fact that people of both sietch and graben referred to Muad\u0027Dib as Him . And she went questioning among the tribes, sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: \"When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul recalled that he had sat there in his mother\u0027s quarters, in the inner chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns out of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her out, noting the way she was always observing - even when her eyes were lowered. Her oval face had new lines in it at the corners of the mouth, but the hair was still like polished bronze. The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their over-casting of spice-imbued blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing about religion is simple,\" she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: \"Religion unifies our forces. It\u0027s our mystique.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,\" she charged. \"You never cease indoctrinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thus you yourself taught me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been the day of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had understood some of the reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his liaison - the \"marriage of youth\" - with Chani. But Chani had produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had found herself unable to reject the child with the mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: \"You think me an unnatural mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see the way you watch me when I\u0027m with your sister. You don\u0027t understand about your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know why Alia is different,\" he said. \"She was unborn, part of you, when you changed the Water of Life. She - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know nothing of it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time, said only: \"I don\u0027t think you unnatural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw his distress, said: \"There is a thing, Son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love your Chani. I accept her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was real, Paul told himself. This wasn\u0027t the imperfect vision to be changed by the twistings out of time\u0027s own birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality began to dip through the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly that he was in a hiereg, a desert camp. Chani had planted their stilltent on flour-sand for its softness. That could only mean Chani was near by - Chani, his soul, Chani his Sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O my soul,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave no taste for Paradise this night,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I swear by Shai-hulud\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will go there,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObedient to my love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm like the drag of the dunes against the feet:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me of thine eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will tell thee of thy heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me of thy feet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will tell thee of thy hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me of thy sleeping\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will tell thee of thy waking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me of thy desires\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will tell thee of thy need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent. And he\u0027d thought then of Gurney Halleck. Reminded by the familiar instrument, he had thought of Gurney whose face he had seen in a smuggler band, but who had not seen him, could not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the Harkonnens to the son of the Duke they had killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the style of the player in the night, the distinctiveness of the fingers on the baliset\u0027s strings, brought the real musician back to Paul\u0027s memory. It had been Chatt the Leaper, captain of the Fedaykin, leader of the death commandos who guarded Muad\u0027Dib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are in the desert , Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond the Harkonnen patrols. I am here to walk the sand, to lure a maker and mount him by my own cunning that I may be a Fremen entire .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the silence surrounding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the day creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see and know you have no fear,\" Stilgar had said. \"Thus we turn our time around and set ourselves to sleep this night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a slacked stillsuit around his body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So softly he moved, yet Chani heard him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke from the tent\u0027s gloom, another shadow there: \"It\u0027s not yet full light, beloved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sihaya,\" he said, speaking with half a laugh in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call me your desert spring,\" she said, \"but this day I\u0027m thy goad. I am the Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began tightening his stillsuit. \"You told me once the words of the Kitab al-Ibar,\" he said. \"You told me: \u0027Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and till it.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the mother of thy firstborn,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement, securing her stillsuit for the open desert. \"You should get all the rest you can,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: \"The Sayyadina of the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. \"Today, I am both the watcher and the woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should\u0027ve left this duty to another,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting is bad enough at best,\" she said. \"I\u0027d sooner be at thy side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned and cracked the seal of the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill not-quite-dryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn. With it came the smell of a pre-spice mass, the mass they had detected off to the northeast, and that told them there would be a maker near by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and stretched the sleep from his muscles. A faint green-pearl luminescence etched the eastern horizon. The tents of his troop were small false dunes around him in the gloom. He saw movement off to the left - the guard, and knew they had seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew the peril he faced this day. Each Fremen had faced it. They gave him this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be done today , he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom - the old men who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle, the old men who listened to him now in council and followed his plans, the men who returned to pay him that highest Fremen compliment: \"Your plan worked, Muad\u0027Dib.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing that he had never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not ridden the maker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he\u0027d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had not made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the abilities of others. No true Fremen could permit this. Until he did this thing himself, even the great southlands - the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg - were denied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one of the sick and wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the night. He saw a strange parallel here - if he mastered the maker, his rule was strengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this carried its own measure of command. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great Unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him - accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it in situ. Yet, when it was born, when it came into the pressures of reality, the now had its own life and grew with its own subtle differences. Terrible purpose remained. Race consciousness remained. And over all loomed the jihad, bloody and wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him from the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that she was trying to distract him, ease his mind of tensions before the deadly test. It was growing lighter, and he noted that some of his Fedaykin were already striking their tents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather you told me about the sietch and about our son,\" he said. \"Does our Leto yet hold my mother in his palm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Alia he holds as well,\" she said. \"And he grows rapidly. He\u0027ll be a big man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it like in the south?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you ride the maker you\u0027ll see for yourself,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I wish to see it first through your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s powerfully lonely,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her stillsuit cap. \"Why will you not talk about the sietch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It\u0027s a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are children to train that the tribe\u0027s strength may never be lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food. Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sister, Alia - is she accepted yet by the people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight. Her eyes bored into him. \"It\u0027s a thing to be discussed another time, beloved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us discuss it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should conserve your energies for the test,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal in her voice. \"The unknown brings its own worries,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently she nodded, said, \"There is yet . . . misunderstanding because of Alia\u0027s strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more than an infant talks . . . of things that only an adult should know. They do not understand the . . . change in the womb that made Alia . . . different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is trouble?\" he asked. And he thought: I\u0027ve seen visions of trouble over Alia .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise. \"Some of the women banded to appeal to the Reverend Mother. They demanded she exorcise the demon in her daughter. They quoted the scripture: \u0027Suffer not a witch to live among us.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did my mother say to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: \u0027If Alia incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing the trouble.\u0027 And she tried to explain how the change had worked on Alia in the womb. But the women were angry because they had been embarrassed. They went away muttering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be trouble because of Alia , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face, bringing the scent of the pre-spice mass. \"El Sayal, the rain of sand that brings the morning,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the landscape beyond pity, the sand that was form absorbed in itself. Dry lightning streaked a dark corner to the south - sign that a storm had built up its static charge there. The roll of thunder boomed long after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The voice that beautifies the land,\" Chani said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore of his men were stirring out of their tents. Guards were coming in from the rims. Everything around him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that required no orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give as few orders as possible,\" his father had told him . . . once . . . long ago. \"Once you\u0027ve given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen knew this rule instinctively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe troop\u0027s watermaster began the morning chanty, adding to it now the call for the rite to initiate a sandrider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The world is a carcass,\" the man chanted, his voice wailing across the dunes. \"Who can turn away the Angel of Death? What Shai-hulud has decreed must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the death chant of his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they buried themselves into battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another soul? Paul asked himself. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add another stone and think on Muad\u0027Dib who died in this place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew this was among the alternatives today, a fact along lines of the future radiating from this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued him. The more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of the jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His entire future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm - the violent nexus beyond which all was fog and clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stilgar approaches,\" Chani said. \"I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, I must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the Chronicles.\" She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then she had herself under control. \"When this is past, I shall prepare thy breakfast with my own hands,\" she said. She turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, stirring up little dust puddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed stare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the lines of craggy cheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock for all their movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man carried Paul\u0027s banner on its staff - the green and black banner with a water tube in the staff - that already was a legend in the land. Half pridefully, Paul thought: I cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a legend. They will mark how I parted from Chani, how I greet Stilgar - every move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then it will be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his sides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought how his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They denied us the Hajj,\" Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Chani had taught him, Paul responded: \"Who can deny a Fremen the right to walk or ride where he wills?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a Naib,\" Stilgar said, \"never to be taken alive. I am a leg of the death tripod that will destroy our foes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar, the way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer. And he thought of how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing, an entire people who had lived with rage and grief all of their days, never once considering what might take the place of either - except for a dream with which Liet-Kynes had infused them before his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?\" Stilgar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is ever with us,\" the Fremen chanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice. \"Now, remember what I told you. Do it simply and directly - nothing fancy. Among our people, we ride the maker at the age of twelve. You are more than six years beyond that age and not born to this life. You don\u0027t have to impress anyone with your courage. We know you are brave. All you must do is call the maker and ride him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will remember,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See that you do. I\u0027ll not have you shame my teaching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe. The thing was pointed at one end, had a spring-wound clapper at the other end. \"I prepared this thumper myself. It\u0027s a good one. Take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shishakli has your hooks,\" Stilgar said. \"He\u0027ll hand them to you as you step out onto that dune over there.\" He pointed to his right. \"Call a big maker, Usul. Show us the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul marked the tone of Stilgar\u0027s voice - half ritual and half that of a worried friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took on the silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and dryness even for Arrakis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the time of the scalding day,\" Stilgar said, and now his voice was entirely ritual. \"Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader of men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply now that the dawn wind had died. He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated - a dirty tan slope with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving out in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne robed figure remained in Paul\u0027s path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the Fedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The shafts were about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end, roughened at the other end for a firm grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are my own hooks,\" Shishakli said in a husky voice. \"They never have failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and up the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like a flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy ridge with only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a good dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the viewpoint vantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming. Then he hesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death necessities that faced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the sand, a giant worm - a maker - would hear and come to the drumming. With the whiplike hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker\u0027s high curving back. For as long as a forward edge of a worm\u0027s ring segment was held open by a hook, open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior, the creature would not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact, roll its gigantic body to bring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a sandrider , Paul told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only to shift those hooks down the curve of a maker\u0027s immense side to make the creature roll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it done. He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland - to rest and restore himself - into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,\" Stilgar had explained. \"You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper\u0027s latch. The clapper began revolving and the summons drummed through the sand, a measured \"lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar\u0027s words: \"Judge the line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an unseen approach to a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it before you see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Chani\u0027s words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him overcame her, filled his mind: \"When you take your stand along the maker\u0027s path, you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand. Hide beneath your cloak and become a little dune in your very essence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had been taught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently he saw the faraway outline of the creature\u0027s track against the dawnlight and realized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of one this size. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the rise of the sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is nothing I have seen by vision or in life , Paul cautioned himself. He hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand, caught up entirely by the rushing needs of this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Control the coinage and the courts\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- let the rabble have the rest.\" Thus the Padishah Emperor advises you. And he tells you: \"If you want profits, you must rule.\" There is truth in these words, but I ask myself: \"Who are the rabble and who are the ruled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s Secret Message to the Landsraad from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought came unbidden to Jessica\u0027s mind: Paul will be undergoing his sandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but it\u0027s obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Chani has gone on some mysterious errand .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the night\u0027s classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had enjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place had thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand, multicolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that she had come to associate with a sense of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place. It was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber. Jessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay\u0027s. Her time was near. And Jessica knew she\u0027d see the baby soon enough - a blue-eyed cherub brought to the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would be at the celebration and would report on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn\u0027t have started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave raids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and the dangers he faced - the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural dangers of the desert - makers and thirst and dust chasms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen endured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup upon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn offering from the birth celebration , Jessica thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society of our universe , she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? I could alter any poison now before it did me harm, or course, but the donor doesn\u0027t realize this .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents - hot and delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift - with only a slight tinge of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had thought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHas Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He\u0027s capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-24.html","bookId":2153,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:42 PM"}
