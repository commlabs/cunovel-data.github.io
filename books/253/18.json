From time to time, someone I\u0027ve neverheard of before sends me a letter (spelling my namewrong) to tell me what a pleasure it is to have me as aspecial customer. No matter how hard they try toimprove their \"personalized\" service, however, banksare pretty much the same all over, and my bank is reallyno different from the rest. So why do I still bank thereeven though two new, competing banks have recentlyopened much closer to where I live? Convenience?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Obviously not. Better rates? Nope. More services? No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s none of these things.
