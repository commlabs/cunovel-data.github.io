But LeShan took two quick steps and thrust a hand into the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" he said, holding out one of the shards toward Rob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob didn\u0027t glance up. He was kneeling by Timon, one hand on the old man\u0027s upper chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on,\" he said. Then he glanced up at Mereniang. \"He\u0027s so weak! It\u0027s as if his life-force has disappeared...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crystal was sustaining him,\" Mereniang said. Her blue eyes, though still fixed on Timon, were dull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had withdrawn into herself, arms wrapped around her body. \"When it shattered, his life ended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not dead yet!\" Rob said fiercely. He shut his eyes, placing his free hand on Timon\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn could sense the healing energy flowing from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Timon whispered. \"It\u0027s no use, and I need you to listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk,\" Rob ordered, but Kait went to kneel by the old man. She needed to understand what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do it?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon\u0027s eyes opened. There was a strange serenity in their depths. He even managed something like a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right,\" he said faintly. \"Change is good - or at least necessary. Take the shard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan was still holding out the crystal. Kaitlyn looked from him to Timon. Then she reached out her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shard was almost as thick as her wrist and a foot long. It was cold and heavy and the facets were very sharp. One sliced into her thumb when she tested the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it back with you, and do what needs to be done,\" Timon whispered. His voice was almost inaudible now. Rob was sweating, his hands trembling, but Timon seemed to be fading away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some things are so evil they must be fought...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver went through Timon\u0027s frame, and a strange sound came from his lungs. Death rattle, Kaitlyn thought, too numb to move. It was almost like hearing a soul leave a body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon\u0027s eyes were wide, staring at the sky. But now they were unseeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s throat felt tight and swollen. Her eyes filled, tears spilling over. All around her the members of the Fellowship were milling about, like a flock of birds thrown into confusion. They didn\u0027t seem to know what to do now that Timon was dead and the crystal shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rob\u0027s chest was heaving. His hair was dark with sweat, his eyes dark with grief. A healer who had lost the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn scooted over to him, glad to have some problem she could understand. She put her arms around him. She felt a ripple in the newly free web and saw Lewis and Anna come to kneel beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey put their arms around both Kait and Rob. All of them holding on as they had in the blizzard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClinging to one another because they were all they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, you lot!\" LeShan was shouting. \"Timon\u0027s gone, but we\u0027re still alive. We\u0027re going to have to think for ourselves. And we don\u0027t have time to stand around!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have to leave, of course,\" LeShan said. He seemed to have taken charge while Mereniang was grieving. Kaitlyn was glad; LeShan might be aggressive and quick-tempered, but she found him much easier to understand than the rest of the Fellowship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all standing in the central hallway of the white house. Around them the Fellowship was busying itself, packing and carrying, moving and loading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Mr. Zetes will attack again,\" Rob said. It wasn\u0027t a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that was just the beginning. He\u0027s removed our defenses - and that was probably all he could do at one go. Next time it\u0027ll be for the kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall woman looked in from another hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"LeShan, are the children coming with us? I\u0027m trying to arrange transportation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan looked at Kait and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke at first. Then Rob said, \"Let me get this clear. Timon\u0027s idea was that we should go back down to Mr. Zetes, and use the shard of your crystal to destroy his crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way to do it,\" LeShan said. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean you have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timon died so we could have a shard,\" Anna said. Her normally gentle face was severe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I still don\u0027t understand,\" Kait burst out. \"Why did everyone listen to him? You were dead-set against fighting before - what made you all change your minds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan\u0027s lip curled. \"I don\u0027t think they all did change their minds. They\u0027re just used to obeying Timon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might not have considered himself the leader, but everyone let him do the thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he changed his mind because of the attack?\" Lewis said uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of Sabrina,\" Kaitlyn said. Everyone looked at her. \"Didn\u0027t you see?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis blinked. \"Who\u0027s Sabrina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sabrina Jessica Gallo. She was one of the gray people. I didn\u0027t realize it before because I couldn\u0027t see her face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Rob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive. I saw her clearly this time. And I guess that means the other gray people are the other old students. They all looked young to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was what Timon sensed,\" LeShan said. His lips were still curled slightly, as if he had an unpleasant taste in his mouth. \"We all sensed it, everyone who was touching the crystal. The attackers were children\u0026nbsp; - none of them over twenty. And their minds were twisted... I can\u0027t explain it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were insane,\" Kaitlyn told him rather calmly. \"That\u0027s what Mr. Zetes said, that the crystal had driven them crazy. And that\u0027s why I never thought of him using them to attack us. I had the idea they were in institutions somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Mr. Z got them out,\" Lewis said hollowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan grimaced. \"In any case, we could feel their agony - and their evil. None of us realized evil like that still existed in the world. I think we had the idea that it died when our country died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re not going to tell us what that country was, are you?\" Kaitlyn asked. She\u0027d been meaning to get the question in since yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan seemed not to hear her. \"If you four go back down to fight this man, it will be dangerous,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t pretend otherwise. And you can\u0027t rely on any help from us. I\u0027ve got to make sure all these people get settled somewhere - and by the time I\u0027m free, it may be all over with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Rob said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can help after that, I will. But it\u0027s your decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d be safe if we went with you?\" Kaitlyn asked. She felt almost wistful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reasonably safe. Nobody can promise perfect safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn sighed. She looked at Rob, and at Lewis and Anna. They were all looking at one another, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo we really have a choice? Rob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer we wait, the stronger Mr. Z will get, Anna said. Her thought smoldered with conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe might as well finish what we started, Lewis put in, sounding resigned. He\u0027d bounced back remarkably quickly from his upset. With his natural resilience and optimism, he was even now hoping for the best in Lydia - Kait could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn had a different reason for wanting to go back. Yes, she wanted to stop Mr. Zetes, but there was something more important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel, she told the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an immediate swell of emotion. Some of it was anger, bewilderment, feelings of betrayal. But there was sympathy, too, and determination - and love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re right, Rob thought. If he really is going to join Mr. Zetes -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m afraid he is, Kaitlyn broke in. I should have thought of it last night. Meren said that any crystal that produces energy could feed him. And Mr. Z\u0027s crystal certainly produces energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think that\u0027s why he left? Anna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know. I doubt that\u0027s all of it. But I think he\u0027d rather get energy from a crystal than from people. And the more contact he has with that crystal -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The worse he\u0027ll get,\" Rob said aloud. \"The more like Sabrina and those other poor jerks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to stop that,\" Lewis said, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob looked at him, and then smiled. It was just the ghost of his normal grin, but it warmed Kaitlyn immeasurably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve got to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents may be able to help,\" Anna said. \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve been trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan said, \"I\u0027ll arrange your transportation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all he said, but his lynx eyes flashed at Kaitlyn. She had the impression that he was desperately proud of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, there\u0027s one more thing, \" she said anxiously. \"I wanted to ask you before, but I never got the chance. There\u0027s this girl back in California. Mr. Zetes put her into a coma somehow - with drugs, we think. I told her brother that we\u0027d ask you for help, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice trailed off. She could feel Rob\u0027s concern regarding Marisol, and his chagrin over forgetting - but LeShan\u0027s face was impassive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course they won\u0027t be able to help, she thought. They\u0027re not doctors. I was stupid for even asking...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to imagine Marisol\u0027s brother\u0027s face when she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan was nonchalant. \"The perfect crystals had the virtue of curing most diseases,\" he said. \"Even a shard ought to do something to help your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s breath came out in a rush. She hadn\u0027t even realized she was holding it, but suddenly her heart was lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeShan was walking away, but he glanced back over his shoulder and grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s just us again,\" Lewis said. They were waiting for LeShan to bring them a guide through the forest. Kaitlyn was carrying her duffel bag, which held her clothes - all dirty by now - and her art kit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the crystal shard in her other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re the only ones we have to rely on,\" Kaitlyn agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna said, \"That\u0027s all anybody ever has, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but all that driving, all that searching,\" Lewis said. \"All for nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob looked at him quickly. \"It wasn\u0027t for nothing. We\u0027re stronger now. We know more. And we finally have a weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Anna said. \"We set out to find this place and we did. We wanted to find a way to stop Mr. Z and we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. It\u0027s all over but the screaming,\" Lewis said, but he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn looked back at the white house, now looted and empty. She was wondering if she could have stayed if things had been different. If Gabriel hadn\u0027t betrayed them, if the Fellowship were staying, could she have made her home here? Would it have been a place where she could have belonged?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we can destroy the crystal, we can cure Gabriel, too,\" Rob was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn looked at him fondly. No, she thought. I don\u0027t belong with the Fellowship. I belong with Rob - and Lewis, and Anna, and Gabriel, too. Wherever they are, I\u0027m home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" she said to Rob. \"So let\u0027s go do it. The search is on again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at the shard. As a ray of sun broke through the clouds, it flashed like diamond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-possessed-dark-visions-2/page-16.html","bookId":2125,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:06 PM"}
