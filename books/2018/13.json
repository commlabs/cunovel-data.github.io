Even the period of his greatest renown is known to us chiefly through the eyes of his antagonists and, principally, through those of a young bride...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncyclopedia Galactica\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta\u0027s first sight of Haven was entirely the contrary of spectacular. Her husband pointed it out - a dull star lost in the emptiness of the Galaxy\u0027s edge. It was past the last sparse clusters, to where straggling points of light gleamed lonely. And even among these it was poor and inconspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran was quite aware that as the earliest prelude to married life, the Red Dwarf lacked impressiveness and his lips curled self-consciously. \"I know, Bay - It isn\u0027t exactly a proper change, is it? I mean from the Foundation to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A horrible change, Toran. I should never have married you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when his face looked momentarily hurt, before he caught himself, she said with her special \"cozy\" tone, \"All right, silly. Now let your lower lip droop and give me that special dying-duck look - the one just before you\u0027re supposed to bury your head on my shoulder, while I stroke your hair full of static electricity. You were fishing for some drivel, weren\u0027t you? You were expecting me to say \u0027I\u0027d be happy anywhere with you, Toran!\u0027 or \u0027The interstellar depths themselves would be home, my sweet, were you but with me!\u0027 Now you admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed a finger at him and snatched it away an instant before his teeth closed upon it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"If I surrender, and admit you\u0027re right, will you prepare dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded contentedly. He smiled, and just looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t beautiful on the grand scale to others - he admitted that - even if everybody did look twice. Her hair was dark and glossy, though straight, her mouth a bit wide - but her meticulous, close-textured eyebrows separated a white, unlined forehead from the warmest mahogany eyes ever filled with smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd behind a very sturdily-built and staunchly-defended facade of practical, unromantic, hard-headedness towards life, there was just that little pool of softness that would never show if you poked for it, but could be reached if you knew just how - and never let on that you were looking for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran adjusted the controls unnecessarily and decided to relax. He was one interstellar jump, and then several milli-microparsecs \"on the straight\" before manipulation by hand was necessary. He leaned over backwards to look into the storeroom, where Bayta was juggling appropriate containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was quite a bit of smugness about his attitude towards Bayta - the satisfied awe that marks the triumph of someone who has been hovering at the edge of an inferiority complex for three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all he was a provincial - and not merely a provincial, but the son of a renegade Trader. And she was of the Foundation itself - and not merely that, but she could trace her ancestry back to Mallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with all that, a tiny quiver underneath. To take her back to Haven, with its rock-world and cave-cities was bad enough. To have her face the traditional hostility of Trader for Foundation - nomad for city dweller - was worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill - After supper, the last jump!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven was an angry crimson blaze, and the second planet was a ruddy patch of light with atmosphere-blurred rim and a half-sphere of darkness. Bayta leaned over the large view table with its spidering of crisscross lines that centered Haven II neatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said gravely, \"I wish I had met your father first. If he takes a dislike to me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said Toran matter-of-factly, \"you would be the first pretty girl to inspire that in him. Before he lost his arm and stopped roving around the Galaxy, he - Well, if you ask him about it, he\u0027ll talk to you about it till your ears wear down to a nubbin. After a while I got to thinking that he was embroidering; because he never told the same story twice the same way-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven II was rushing up at them now. The landlocked sea wheeled ponderously below them, slate-gray in the lowering dimness and lost to sight, here and there, among the wispy clouds. Mountains jutted raggedly along the coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea became wrinkled with nearness and, as it veered off past the horizon just at the end, there was one vanishing glimpse of shore-hugging ice fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran grunted under the fierce deceleration, \"Is your suit locked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta\u0027s plump face was round and ruddy in the incasing sponge-foam of the internally-heated, skin-clinging costume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship lowered crunchingly on the open field just short of the lifting of the plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed out awkwardly into the solid darkness of the outer-galactic night, and Bayta gasped as the sudden cold bit, and the thin wind swirled emptily. Toran seized her elbow and nudged her into an awkward run over the smooth, packed ground towards the sparking of artificial light in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advancing guards met them halfway, and after a whispered exchange of words, they were taken onward. The wind and the cold disappeared when the gate of rock opened and then closed behind them. The warm interior, white with wall-light, was filled with an incongruous humming bustle. Men looked up from their desks, and Toran produced documents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waved onward after a short glance and Toran whispered to his wife, \"Dad must have fixed up the preliminaries. The usual lapse here is about five hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey burst into the open and Bayta said suddenly, \"Oh, my-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cave city was in daylight - the white daylight of a young sun. Not that there was a sun, of course. What should have been the sky was lost in the unfocused glow of an over-all brilliance. And the warm air was properly thick and fragrant with greenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta said, \"Why, Toran, it\u0027s beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran grinned with anxious delight. \"Well, now, Bay, it isn\u0027t like anything on the Foundation, of course, but it\u0027s the biggest city on Haven II - twenty thousand people, you know - and you\u0027ll get to like it. No amusement palaces, I\u0027m afraid, but no secret police either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Torie, it\u0027s just like a toy city. It\u0027s all white and pink - and so clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-\" Toran looked at the city with her. The houses were two stories high for the most part, and of the smooth vein rock indigenous to the region. The spires of the Foundation were missing, and the colossal community houses of the Old Kingdoms - but the smallness was there and the individuality; a relic of personal initiative in a Galaxy of mass life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snapped to sudden attention. \"Bay - There\u0027s Dad! Right there - where I\u0027m pointing, silly. Don\u0027t you see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did. It was just the impression of a large man, waving frantically, fingers spread wide as though groping wildly in air. The deep thunder of a drawn-out shout reached them. Bayta trailed her husband, rushing downwards over the close-cropped lawn. She caught sight of a smaller man, white-haired, almost lost to view behind the robust One-arm, who still waved and still shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran cried over his shoulder, \"It\u0027s my father\u0027s half-brother. The one who\u0027s been to the Foundation. You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey met in the grass, laughing and incoherent, and Toran\u0027s father let out a final whoop for sheer joy. He hitched at his short jacket and adjusted the metal-chased belt that was his one concession to luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes shifted from one of the youngsters to the other, and then he said, a little out of breath, \"You picked a rotten day to return home, boy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh, it is Seldon\u0027s birthday, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. I had to rent a car to make the trip here, and dragoon Randu to drive it. Not a public vehicle to be had at gun\u0027s point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were on Bayta now, and didn\u0027t leave. He spoke to her more softly, \"I have the crystal of you right here - and it\u0027s good, but I can see the fellow who took it was an amateur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the small cube of transparency out of his jacket pocket and in the light the laughing little face within sprang to vivid colored life as a miniature Bayta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one!\" said Bayta. \"Now I wonder why Toran should send that caricature. I\u0027m surprised you let me come near you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you now? Call me Fran. I\u0027ll have none of this fancy mess. For that, I think you can take my arm, and we\u0027ll go on to the car. Till now I never did think my boy knew what he was ever up to. I think I\u0027ll change that opinion. I think I\u0027ll have to change that opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran said to his half uncle softly, \"How is the old man these days? Does he still hound the women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandu puckered up all over his face when he smiled. \"When he can, Toran, when he can. There are times when he remembers that his next birthday will be his sixtieth, and that disheartens him. But he shouts it down, this evil thought, and then he is himself. He is a Trader of the ancient type. But you, Toran. Where did you find such a pretty wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man chuckled and linked arms. \"Do you want a three years\u0027 history at a gasp, uncle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the small living room of the home that Bayta struggled out of her traveling cloak and hood and shook her hair loose. She sat down, crossing her knees, and returned the appreciative stare of this large, ruddy man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I know what you\u0027re trying to estimate, and I\u0027ll help you; Age, twenty-four, height, five-four, weight, one-ten, educational specialty, history.\" She noticed that he always crooked his stand so as to hide the missing arm. But now Fran leaned close and said, \"Since you mention it - weight, one-twenty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed loudly at her flush. Then he said to the company in general, \"You can always tell a woman\u0027s weight by her upper arm - with due experience, of course. Do you want a drink, Bay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among other things,\" she said, and they left together, while Toran busied himself at the book shelves to check for new additions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFran returned alone and said, \"She\u0027ll be down later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered himself heavily into the large comer chair and placed his stiff-jointed left leg on the stool before it. The laughter had left his red face, and Toran turned to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFran said, \"Well, you\u0027re home, boy, and I\u0027m glad you are. I like your woman. She\u0027s no whining ninny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I married her,\" said Toran simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s another thing altogether, boy.\" His eyes darkened. \"It\u0027s a foolish way to tie up the future. In my longer life, and more experienced, I never did such a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandu interrupted from the comer where he stood quietly. \"Now Franssart, what comparisons are you making? Till your crash landing six years ago you were never in one spot long enough to establish residence requirements for marriage, And since then, who would have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one-armed man jerked erect in his seat and replied hotly, \"Many, you snowy dotard-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran said with hasty tact, \"It\u0027s largely a legal formality, Dad. The situation has its conveniences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mostly for the woman,\" grumbled Fran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And even if so,\" agreed Randu, \"it\u0027s up to the boy to decide. Marriage is an old custom among the Foundationers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Foundationers are not fit models for an honest Trader,\" smoldered Fran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran broke in again, \"My wife is a Foundationer.\" He looked from one to the other, and then said quietly, \"She\u0027s coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation took a general turn after the evening meal, which Fran had spiced with three tales of reminiscence composed of equal parts of blood, women, profits, and embroidery. The small televisor was on, and some classic drama was playing itself out in an unregarded whisper. Randu had hitched himself into a more comfortable position on the low couch and gazed past the slow smoke of his long pipe to where Bayta had knelt down upon the softness of the white fur mat brought back once long ago from a trade mission and now spread out only upon the most ceremonious occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have studied history, my girl?\" he asked, pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta nodded. \"I was the despair of my teachers, but I learned a bit, eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A citation for scholarship,\" put in Toran, smugly, \"that\u0027s all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did you learn?\" proceeded Randu, smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything? Now?\" laughed the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man smiled gently. \"Well then, what do you think of the Galactic situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" said Bayta, concisely, \"that a Seldon crisis is pending - and that if it isn\u0027t then away with the Seldon plan altogether. It is a failure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(\"Whew,\" muttered Fran, from his comer. \"What a way to speak of Seldon.\" But he said nothing aloud.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandu sucked at his pipe speculatively. \"Indeed? Why do you say that? I was to the Foundation, you know, in my younger days, and I, too, once thought great dramatic thoughts. But, now, why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Bayta\u0027s eyes misted with thought as she curled her bare toes into the white softness of the rug and nestled her little chin in one plump hand, \"it seems to me that the whole essence of Seldon\u0027s plan was to create a world better than the ancient one of the Galactic Empire. It was failing apart, that world, three centuries ago, when Seldon first established the Foundation - and if history speaks truly, it was falling apart of the triple disease of inertia, despotism, and maldistribution of the goods of the universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandu nodded slowly, while Toran gazed with proud, luminous eyes at his wife, and Fran in the comer clucked his tongue and carefully refilled his glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta said, \"If the story of Seldon is true, he foresaw the complete collapse of the Empire through his Jaws of psychohistory, and was able to predict the necessary thirty thousand years of barbarism before the establishment of a new Second Empire to restore civilization and culture to humanity. It was the whole aim of his life-work to set up such conditions as would insure a speedier rejuvenation,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deep voice of Fran burst out, \"And that\u0027s why he established the two Foundations, honor be to his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s why he established the two Foundations,\" assented Bayta. \"Our Foundation was a gathering of the scientists of the dying Empire intended to carry on the science and learning of man to new heights. And the Foundation was so situated in space and the historical environment was such that through the careful calculations of his genius, Seldon foresaw that in one thousand years, it would become a newer, greater Empire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a reverent silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl said softly, \"It\u0027s an old story. You all know it. For almost three centuries every human being of the Foundation has known it. But I thought it would be appropriate to go through it - just quickly. Today is Seldon\u0027s birthday, you know, and even if I am of the Foundation, and you are of Haven, we have that in common-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lit a cigarette slowly, and watched the glowing tip absently. \"The laws of history are as absolute as the laws of physics, and if the probabilities of error are greater, it is only because history does not deal with as many humans as physics does atoms, so that individual variations count for more. Seldon predicted a series of crises through the thousand years of growth, each of which would force a new turning of our history into a pre-calculated path. It is those crises which direct us - and therefore a crisis must come now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now!\" she repeated, forcefully. \"It\u0027s almost a century since the last one, and in that century, every vice of the Empire has been repeated in the Foundation. Inertia! Our ruling class knows one law; no change. Despotism! They know one rule; force. Maldistribution! They know one desire; to hold what is theirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While others starve!\" roared Fran suddenly with a mighty blow of his fist upon the arm of his chair. \"Girl, your words are pearls. The fat guts on their moneybags ruin the Foundation, while the brave Traders hide their poverty on dregs of worlds like Haven. It\u0027s a disgrace to Seldon, a casting of dirt in his face, a spewing in his beard.\" He raised his arm high, and then his face lengthened. \"If I had my other arm! If - once - they had listened to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" said Toran, \"take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy. Take it easy,\" his father mimicked savagely. \"We\u0027ll live here and die here forever - and you say, take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s our modern Lathan Devers,\" said Randu, gesturing with his pipe, \"this Fran of ours. Devers died in the slave mines eighty years ago with your husband\u0027s great-grandfather, because he lacked wisdom and didn\u0027t lack heart-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, by the Galaxy, I\u0027d do the same if I were he,\" swore Fran. \"Devers was the greatest Trader in history - greater than the overblown windbag, Mallow, the Foundationers worship. If the cutthroats who lord the Foundation killed him because he loved justice, the greater the blood-debt owed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, girl,\" said Randu. \"Go on, or, surely, he\u0027ll talk a the night and rave all the next day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to go on about,\" she said, with a sudden gloom. \"There must be a crisis, but I don\u0027t know how to make one. The progressive forces on the Foundation are oppressed fearfully. You Traders may have the will, but you are hunted and disunited. If all the forces of good will in and out of the Foundation could combine-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFran\u0027s laugh was a raucous jeer. \"Listen to her, Randu, listen to her. In and out of the Foundation, she says. Girl, girl, there\u0027s no hope in the flab-sides of the Foundation. Among them some hold the whip and the rest are whipped dead whipped. Not enough spunk left in the whole rotten world to outface one good Trader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta\u0027s attempted interruptions broke feebly against the overwhelming wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran leaned over and put a hand over her mouth. \"Dad,\" he said, coldly, \"you\u0027ve never been on the Foundation. You know nothing about it. I tell you that the underground there is brave and daring enough. I could tell you that Bayta was one of them-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, boy, no offense. Now, where\u0027s the cause for anger?\" He was genuinely perturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran drove on fervently, \"The trouble with you, Dad, is that you\u0027ve got a provincial outlook. You think because some hundred thousand Traders scurry into holes on an unwanted planet at the end of nowhere, that they\u0027re a great people. Of course, any tax collector from the Foundation that gets here never leaves again, but that\u0027s cheap heroism. What would you do if the Foundation sent a fleet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d blast them,\" said Fran, sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And get blasted - with the balance in their favor. You\u0027re outnumbered, outarmed, outorganized - and as soon as the Foundation thinks it worth its while, you\u0027ll realize that. So you had better seek your allies - on the Foundation itself, if you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Randu, said Fran, looking at his brother like a great, helpless bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandu took his pipe away from his lips, \"The boy\u0027s right, Fran. When you listen to the little thoughts deep inside you, you know he is. But they\u0027re uncomfortable thoughts, so you drown them out with that roar of yours. But they\u0027re still there. Toran, I\u0027ll tell you why I brought all this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puffed thoughtfully awhile, then dipped his pipe into the neck of the tray, waited for the silent flash, and withdrew it clean. Slowly, he filled it again with precise tamps of his little finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Your little suggestion of Foundation\u0027s interest in us, Toran, is to the point. There have been two recent visits lately - for tax purposes. The disturbing point is that the second visitor was accompanied by a light patrol ship. They landed in Gleiar City - giving us the miss for a change - and they never lifted off again, naturally. But now they\u0027ll surely be back. Your father is aware of all this, Toran, he really is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at the stubborn rakehell. He knows Haven is in trouble, and he knows we\u0027re helpless, but he repeats his formulas. It warms and protects him. But once he\u0027s had his say, and roared his defiance, and feels he\u0027s discharged his duty as a man and a Bull Trader, why he\u0027s as reasonable as any of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any of who?\" asked Bayta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her. \"We\u0027ve formed a little group, Bayta - just in our city. We haven\u0027t done anything, yet. We haven\u0027t even managed to contact the other cities yet, but it\u0027s a start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But towards what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandu shook his head. \"We don\u0027t know-yet. We hope for a miracle. We have decided that, as you say, a Seldon crisis must be at hand.\" He gestured widely upwards. \"The Galaxy is full of the chips and splinters of the broken Empire. The generals swarm. Do you suppose the time may come when one will grow bold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta considered, and shook her head decisively, so that the long straight hair with the single inward curl at the end swirled about her ears. \"No, not a chance. There\u0027s not one of those generals who doesn\u0027t know that an attack on the Foundation is suicide. Bel Riose of the old Empire was a better man than any of them, and he attacked with the resources of a galaxy, and couldn\u0027t win against the Seldon Plan. Is there one general that doesn\u0027t know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if we spur them on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into where? Into an atomic furnace? With what could you possibly spur them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there is one - a new one. In this past year or two, there has come word of a strange man whom they call the Mule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mule?\" She considered. \"Ever hear of him, Torie?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran shook his head. She said, \"What about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But he wins victories at, they say, impossible odds. The rumors may be exaggerated, but it would be interesting, in any case, to become acquainted with him. Not every man with sufficient ability and sufficient ambition would believe in Hari Seldon and his laws of psychohistory. We could encourage that disbelief. He might attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Foundation would win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes - but not necessarily easily. It might be a crisis, and we could take advantage of such a crisis to force a compromise with the despots of the Foundation. At the worst, they would forget us long enough to enable us to plan farther.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think, Torie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran smiled feebly and pulled at a loose brown curl that fell over one eye. \"The way he describes it, it can\u0027t hurt; but who is the Mule? What do you know of him, Randu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing yet. For that, we could use you, Toran. And your wife, if she\u0027s willing. We\u0027ve talked of this, your father and I. We\u0027ve talked of this thoroughly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way, Randu? What do you want of us?\" The young man cast a quick inquisitive look at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you had a honeymoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... yes... if you can call the trip from the Foundation a honeymoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a better one on Kalgan? It\u0027s semitropical beaches - water sports - bird hunting - quite the vacation spot. It\u0027s about seven thousand parsecs in-not too far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s on Kalgan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mule! His men, at least. He took it last month, and without a battle, though Kalgan\u0027s warlord broadcast a threat to blow the planet to ionic dust before giving it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the warlord now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t,\" said Randu, with a shrug. \"What do you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what are we to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Fran and I are old; we\u0027re provincial. The Traders of Haven are all essentially provincial. Even you say so. Our trading is of a very restricted sort, and we\u0027re not the Galaxy roamers our ancestors were, Shut up, Fran! But you two know the Galaxy. Bayta, especially, speaks with a nice Foundation accent. We merely wish whatever you can find out. If you can make contact... but we wouldn\u0027t expect that. Suppose you two think it over. You can meet our entire group if you wish... oh, not before next week. You ought to have some time to catch your breath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause and then Fran roared, \"Who wants; another drink? I mean, besides me?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/foundation-and-empire-foundation-2/page-13.html","bookId":2018,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:06:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:06:30 PM"}
