We traded our knee-socks for tights. Every window we passed was covered with frost, blocking our view of the world outside. But nothing made me shiver quite as much as the look on Liz\u0027s face. For days, it was as if we were still separated by the pharmacy windows. It was as if she hardly knew me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I went to the chem lab after supper Tuesday night, Liz was already there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, fancy seeing you here,\" I said, trying to sound chipper as I gathered my things and moved to the lab table across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were shielded behind her protective goggles. She didn\u0027t even look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth to Liz,\" I tried again, but she turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have time to help you with your homework, Cammie,\" she said, and it might have been my imagination, but I could have sworn all the beakers frosted over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"I think I\u0027ve got it under control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe worked in silence for a long time before Liz said, \"He was Josh\u0027s friend—wasn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to ask who she was talking about. \"Yeah, they\u0027re neighbors. I\u0027d met him before, that\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t compromise—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice friend,\" Liz snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s all talk,\" I said, repeating Josh\u0027s words to me. \"He\u0027s harmless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Liz\u0027s voice was shaking when she said, \"Go ask Anna how harmless he is.\" Of course, word of Anna\u0027s encounter in the pharmacy had spread like crazy, and Anna was now something of a hero—thanks to the fact that Bex and Macey insisted that Anna had the situation well under control when they got there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t share this with Liz. We both knew the truth. \"If things had gotten out of hand I could have—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could have or would have?\" Liz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference between those two words had never seemed so huge. \"Would,\" I said. \"I would have stopped it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it meant losing Josh?\" Liz said, not asking what she really wanted to know—that if it had been her instead of Anna in Dillon\u0027s sights, would I have saved her; if it came down to a fight between the real me and my legend, which one would I choose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass doors at the back of the lab slid open, and Macey walked in. \"Hey, I thought I might find you two—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone too far, Cammie,\" Liz said, shaking ingredients wildly into the mix until the whole thing started to bubble and change colors like something in a witch\u0027s caldron. \"You\u0027ve gone too far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve gone too far?\" I said. \"I wasn\u0027t the one blowing up Driver\u0027s Ed cars!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Liz snapped. \"We thought he was a honeypot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I shook my head. \"We thought he was a boy.\" I gathered my things. \"We thought he was worth it. And, you know what? He was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Liz called after me. \"Well, I never thought you were someone who\u0027d choose a boy over her friends!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, cool it,\" Macey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I never thought I had friends who\u0027d make me choose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I neared the door, I heard Liz start to speak, but Macey cut her off, saying, \"Hey, genius girl, you don\u0027t have any idea what kinds of sacrifices she\u0027s willing to make for her friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you—\" Liz started, then her voice softened slightly as she asked, \"Why? What do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Macey spoke, she left no room for doubt. \"Enough to say, back off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass doors slid open and I darted through them just as Liz said, \"Okay,\" but I couldn\u0027t stop moving, didn\u0027t dare break my pace until I reached the supply closet in the east corridor, where I slid aside a stack of long fluorescent light-bulbs, grabbed a flashlight from the top shelf, and found the loose stone that I had discovered one day during my seventh-grade year while looking for Onyx, Buckingham\u0027s cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone was cold beneath my hand when I pushed against it and felt the rush of air as the wall slid aside. A small sliver of light slipped beneath the door behind me, but it faded into nothing in the deep expanse of black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later I was standing in the shadows of Bellis Street, shivering in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I intend to accomplish by sneaking through a secret tunnel, climbing over a fence, and literally staking out Josh\u0027s house in the dark? I didn\u0027t have a clue. Instead, I just stood there like an idiot (and even an idiot who is very good at not being seen while standing around can feel pretty silly while doing it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably a pretty good time to point out that while it may appear that I was lurking—I wasn\u0027t. Lurking is what creepy guys with random facial hair and stains on their shirts do. Geniuses with three years of top secret spy training don\u0027t lurk—we surveil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Okay, I might have been lurking—a little.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite eyelet curtains were pushed back from a kitchen window where Josh\u0027s mother was washing dishes. When Josh walked through the kitchen, his mother blew soapsuds at him, and he laughed. I thought about Bex, who was probably laughing right then, too. I thought about my mother, whose tears only came in secret. I thought about my life—the one I had and the one I wanted, so all I did was stand shivering in the cold, watching Josh laugh, as I started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0027s a girl\u0027s right—isn\u0027t it? To cry sometimes for no reason? Really, when you think about it, that ought to be in the Constitution. Maybe I\u0027ll break into the National Archives sometime and write that in. Bex would totally help me. Somehow, I don\u0027t think the Founding Fathers would mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith finals and the stress that comes with them, I didn\u0027t really see Liz again until supper the following night when she brought her slice of pizza and came to sit beside me. \"So, where did you go last night?\" she asked. But before I could answer, she said, \"To see Josh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t break up with him, did you?\" She sounded genuinely concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Then she must have sensed my confusion because she said, \"He\u0027s good to you, and you deserve that.\" She looked around the Grand Hall at the hundred other girls who were like us. \"We all deserve that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I realized, I think we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stole a glance at Bex who sat beside me, laughing. We all deserve laughter and love and the kinds of friends I had beside me, but as I watched her, I couldn\u0027t help but wonder if she\u0027d still find life so funny if she knew all I knew. I wondered if our fathers\u0027 fates had been reversed, would our personalities have switched, too? Would I be the one standing in the Grand Hall allowing Anna Fetterman to demonstrate how she\u0027d defended herself against a mob of twenty angry townspeople (because, by that time, the mob had grown considerably)? Would Bex, beautiful Bex, be a chameleon, then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Baxter!\" I turned to see Professor Buckingham starting toward us. I felt my heart stop—literally. (It can do that—I know, I asked Liz.) She was walking toward us, bearing down like the force of nature she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey was across the table from me, and we glanced at each other—an unspoken dread lingering between us like the smell of olive oil and melting cheese, but beside me, Bex was unfazed, and I remembered the power of a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she drew near, I tried to read something in Buckingham\u0027s eyes, but they were as cold and blank as stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Baxter, I just had a phone call…\" Buckingham started and then, ever so slightly, turned her gaze toward me. \"…from your father.\" Air returned to my lungs. Blood started moving in my veins, and I\u0027m pretty sure Buckingham gave something that resembled a wink in my direction. \"He said to tell you hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy elbows fell to the table, and across from me, Macey mirrored my relief. It was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Bex said, but she hadn\u0027t even stopped chewing. \"That\u0027s nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would never know how nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced toward the head table, and Mom raised a glass in my direction. Beside me, Bex didn\u0027t breathe a sigh of relief. She didn\u0027t say a prayer. She didn\u0027t do any of the things I felt like doing, but that\u0027s okay, I guess. Her father was still on his high wire. It was just as well she\u0027d never looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost everyone had gone upstairs twenty minutes later when Bex and I started to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what do you want to do now?\" Bex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we could do anything,\" I said, and it was true. We were leaving the hall, and it didn\u0027t matter where we were going. We were trained and we were young and we had the rest of our lives to carry the worry of grown-ups. Right then, I just wanted to celebrate with my best friend—even if she didn\u0027t know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get all the ice cream we can carry and …\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I saw Liz running down the spiral staircase, crying, \"Cammie!\" as if I hadn\u0027t already stopped. And then Liz whispered, or at least she tried to whisper, but I swear everyone in the entire mansion must have heard her when she said, \"It\u0027s Josh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWars have been won and lost, assassination attempts have been thwarted, and women have avoided showing up at the same event in the same dress—all because of really good intel. That\u0027s why we have entire classes devoted to this stuff. But as Liz dragged me into our suite, I didn\u0027t really appreciate its importance until I saw the screen. \"These were here when I got back from supper.\" Poor Liz. She\u0027d done this amazing job of getting us patched into Josh\u0027s system, and I could tell by looking at her that she would have given just about anything to undo it all right then. Ignorance is bliss, after all. But the problem is, for spies, ignorance is usually pretty short-lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom D\u0027Man\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo JAbrams\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you come to your senses yet? I\u0027m telling you—I saw her WITH MY OWN EYES. You\u0027ve got to believe me now. SHE GOES TO THE GALLAGHER ACADEMY!! She\u0027s been lying to you!! How can you take HER word over MINE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom JAbrams\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo D\u0027Man\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trust Cammie. I believe her. You probably just thought you saw her walking with a bunch of those girls on Saturday. She doesn\u0027t even know them. Trust me. Give it a break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon\u0027s response was a single line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom D\u0027Man To JAbrams Tonight. 9:00. WE\u0027LL GET PROOF!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at this point I was starting to panic, which isn\u0027t very spylike, but is pretty girl-like, so I figured I was well within my feminine rights. The \"proof\" to which I\u0027d seen teenage boys refer in movies usually involved video equipment and/or feminine undergarments, so I yelled, \"Oh my gosh!\" and started looking around for Liz\u0027s flash cards. Surely somewhere in all that vat of knowledge there had to be instructions on what to do when your cover is completely and irrevocably blown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaced with the knowledge that the operation had been severely compromised, The Operatives formed a list of alternatives, which included (but were not limited to) the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA. Misdirection: in a variation of the \"you must have seen someone who looks like me\" approach, one of The Operatives could impersonate Cammie and climb the wall while Cammie looks on with Josh and Dillon and says, \"Is that who you saw?\" (Which is especially effective when The Subject is nearsighted.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB. Sympathy: this technique has not only been used successfully by spies for many centuries, but it is also a staple of teenage girls. The conversation would likely resemble the following: \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-28.html","bookId":2746,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM"}
