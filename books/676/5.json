She smoked too much, and she wanted him to help her quit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know that smoking is no good for me,\" she said as she puffed on her cigarette. \"It\u0027s bad for my heart. It fills my lungs with gunk. And my husband won\u0027t kiss me because my breath stinks. But I can\u0027t quit!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She finished her cigarette, smushed it out in an ashtray, then immediately lit another one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have a seat,\" said Dr. Pickle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She sat down on the couch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look into my eyes,\" said Dr. Pickle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman stared into his deep, penetrating eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Pickle held up a gold chain. At the end of the chain was a green stone that was almost transparent but not quite. It looked like a pickle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hence, his name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Watch the pickle,\" he said, as he gently moved the chain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The pickle went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman\u0027s eyes went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Put down your cigarette,\" Dr. Pickle said in a strong but gentle voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman set her cigarette in the ashtray as she continued to stare at the pickle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are getting sleepy,\" said Dr. Pickle. \"Your eyelids are getting heavy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman blinked her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When I count to three,\" said Dr. Pickle, \"you will fall into a deep, deep sleep. One . . . two . . . three.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman\u0027s eyes closed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Pickle put down the pickle. \"Can you hear me?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said the woman, in a low voice from deep inside her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will do what I say,\" said Dr. Pickle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I - will - do - what - you - say,\" the woman repeated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am going to count to five,\" said Dr. Pickle. \"And then you will wake up. And, as usual, you will want to smoke a cigarette.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I - will - want - to - smoke - a - cigarette,\" the woman repeated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But when you put the cigarette in your mouth,\" said Dr. Pickle, \"it will feel just like a worm. A wiggling, slimy worm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A - yucky - icky - worm,\" repeated the woman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Dr. Pickle. \"Now just one more\n\u003cbr\u003e 20\n\u003cbr\u003e thing.\" He rubbed his beard and smiled. \"Whenever your husband says the word \u0027potato,\u0027 you will slap him across the face.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When - Fred - says - \u0027potato\u0027 -I - will - slap -his - face.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Dr. Pickle. He counted to five.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman woke up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So do you think you can help me?\" she asked in her normal voice, as she reached for her cigarette.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Pickle shrugged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She put her cigarette in her mouth, then screamed as she pulled it out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked at the cigarette, puzzled. \"Hm?\" she said. She placed it back in her mouth, then spit it out onto the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, a little confused. She picked up the cigarette and put it in the ashtray.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Dr. Pickle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She took out a new cigarette from her pack, but as soon as she put that in her mouth, she spit it out too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said again. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s come over me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She walked out of his office shaking her head. She dropped her pack of cigarettes in the trash.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She never smoked again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was an interesting thing about the word \"potato.\" Whenever Fred said it, she slapped him. And he\u0027d ask her why she slapped him, but she never remembered slapping him, so they\u0027d get in a big fight, each calling the other crazy. Then they\u0027d kiss and make up, which was nice because her breath didn\u0027t stink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They never figured out it had anything to do with saying \"potato.\" How could they?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But deep down they both must have realized it somehow, because while they used to eat lots of potatoes, they gradually ate fewer and fewer, until they finally stopped eating them altogether.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Pickle was a good doctor, but he kept playing those kinds of jokes on people. There was a woman who quacked like a duck whenever she saw a freight train with more than twenty cars. There was a man who took off his shoe anytime someone said \"parking meter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eventually Dr. Pickle was caught and he was no longer allowed to practice psychiatry. So he had to find another job.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He became a counselor at an elementary school.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56923.html","bookId":676,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:24:18 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:24:18 PM"}
