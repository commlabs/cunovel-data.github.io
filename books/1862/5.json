What was he even doinghere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t easy to get into the garden area fromoutside. He had to bushwhack through the overgrown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erhododendron bushes and blackberry canesthat formedadense hedge all around it. And evenwhen he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemerged from a tunnel of leathery greenleaves, the scene in front of him didn\u0027t immediatelyregister. His\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emomentum kept him going for a fewsteps before his brain caught up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, wait. There\u0027sa girl here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pretty girl. Anextremelypretty girl. He could seeher clearly by the back porch light. She had hiplength\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhite-blond hair, the color that normally onlypreschoolers have, and it was as fine as a child\u0027s hair,too,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhipping around her like pale silk when shemoved. She was smallish. Little bones. Her hands and feet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere delicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing what looked like an oldfashioned nightshirt and dancing to what sounded like a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erent-to-own commercial. There was a battereddock radio on the porch steps. There was also a black\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekitten that took one look at Mark and darted away into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baaad cred-it,nooo cred-it, dooon\u0027t wor-ry,weee\u0027ll take you....\" the radio warbled. The girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edanced with her arms above her head-light as thistledown,Mark thought, staring in astonishment. Really,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eactu ally that light, and so what if it was a cliche\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the commercial ended and a country western song began, she did a twirl and saw him. Shestopped,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrozen, arms still above her head, wristscrossed. Her eyes got big and her mouth sagged open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s scared, Mark thought. Of me. The girl didn\u0027t look graceful now; she was scrambling to seize the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edock radio, fumbling with it, shaking it. Trying to find an Off switch, Mark realized. Her desperation was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econtagious. Before he thought, Mark dropped the pruning shears and swooped in to grab the radio from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. He twisted the top dial, cutting the song short. Then he stared at the girl, who stared backwith wide\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilvery-green eyes. They were both breath ing quickly, as if they\u0027d just disarmed a bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I hate country western, too,\" Mark said aftera minute, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never talked to a girl this way before. But then he\u0027d never had a girl look scared of him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so scared-he imagined he could see her heartbeating in the pale blue veins beneath the translucent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eskin of her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, she stopped looking terrified. Shebit her lip and chortled. Then, still grinning, she blinked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot,\" she said, dabbing at the corner of her eye. \"You don\u0027t have the same rules we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rules about country western music?\" Mark hazarded. He liked her voice. It was ordinary, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecelestial. It made her seem more human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rules about any music from outside,\" she said. \"And any TV, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside what? Mark thought. He said, \"Uh, hi. I\u0027m Mark Carter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Jade Redfern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re one of Mrs. Burdock\u0027s nieces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We just came last night. We\u0027re going to livehere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark snorted and muttered, \"You have my condolences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Condolences? Why?\" Jade cast a darting glance around the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because living in Briar Creek is just slightly moreexciting than living in a cemetery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a long, fascinated look. \"You\u0027ve... lived in a cemetery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gaveher along look. \"Uh, actually, I just meant it\u0027s boring here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She thought, then smiled. \"Well, it\u0027s interesting to us,\" she said. \"It\u0027s different from where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe come from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just wheredo you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An island. It\u0027s sort of near ...\" She considered. \"The state of Maine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027The state of Maine.\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this island have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him with wide green eyes. \"Well, I can\u0027t tell youthat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-okay.\" Was, she making fun of him? Butthere was nothing like mockery or sly teasing in her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface. She looked mysterious ... and innocent. Maybe she had some kind of mental problem. The kids at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewitt High School would have a field day with that. They weren\u0027t very tolerant of differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" he said abruptly. \"If there\u0027s ever anything I can do for you-you know, if you ever get in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrouble or something-then just tell me. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head sideways. Her eyelashes actually cast shadows in the porch light, but her expression\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t coy. It was straightforward and assessing,and she was looking him over carefully, as if she needed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto figure him out. She took her time doingit. Then she smiled, making little dimples in her cheeks, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s heart jumped unexpectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said softly. \"Mark. You\u0027re not silly, even though you\u0027re a boy. You\u0027re a good guy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earen\u0027tyou?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. . .\"Mark had never been called upon to be a good guy, not in the TV sense. He wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esurehow he\u0027d measure up if he were. \"I, um, hope I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was looking at him steadily. \"You know, I just decided. I\u0027m going to like it here.\" She smiledagain,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Mark found it hard to breathe-and then her expression changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark heard it, too. A wild crashing in the overgrown tangle of rhododendrons and blackberrybushes at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe back of the garden. It was a weird,frenzied sound, but Jade\u0027s reaction was out of all proportion. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad frozen, body tense andtrembling, eyes fixed on the underbrush. She looked terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" Mark spoke gently, then touched hershoulder. \"Hey. It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s probably one of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoats that got loose; goats can jump over any kind of fence.\" She was shaking her head. \"Or a deer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they\u0027re relaxed they sound just like people walking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a deer,\" she hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come down and eat people\u0027s gardens a. night. You probably don\u0027t have deer roaming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earoundwhere you come from-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027tsmellanything,\" she said in a kind of whispered wail. \"It\u0027s that stupid pen. Everything smells like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoat. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t smell ... ? Mark did the only thinghe could think of in response to a statement like that. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eput his arms around the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s okay,\" he said softly. He couldn\u0027thelp but notice that she was cool and warm at the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esame time, supple, wonderfully alive underneath the nightshirt. \"Why don\u0027t I take you inside now? You\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe safe there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leggo,\" Jade said ungratefully, squirming. \"I mayhave to fight.\" She wriggled out of his arms and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efaced the bushes again. \"Stay behind me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so sheis crazy. I don\u0027t care. I think I love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood beside her. \"Look, I\u0027ll fight, too. What doyou think it is? Bear, coyote ... ?\"\"My brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your . . .\" Dismay pooled in Mark. She\u0027d just stepped over the line of acceptable craziness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thrashing sound from the bushes. It was definitely something big, not a goat. Mark was just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewondering vaguely if a Roosevelt elk could have wandered down the hundred or so miles from Waldo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLake, when a scream ripped through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA human scream-or, worse,almost human. As it died, there was a wail that was definitely inhumanit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estarted out faint, and then suddenly sounded shrilland dose. Mark was stunned. When the drawn-out wail\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinally stopped, there was a sobbing, moaning sound, then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark got his breath and swore. \"What in thewhat wasthat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh. Keep still.\" Jade was in a half-crouch, eyes on the bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade-Jade, listen. We\u0027ve got to get inside.\" Desperate, he looped an arm around her waist,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to pick her up. She was light, but she flowed like water out of his arms. Like a cat that doesn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to bepetted. \"Jade, whatever that thing is, we need agun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\" She seemed tobe speaking through herteeth-anyway there was something odd about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher diction. She had her back to him and he couldn\u0027t see her face, but her hands were clawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade,\"Mark said urgently. He was scared enoughto run, but he couldn\u0027t leave her. He couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo good guy would do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late. The blackberry bushes to the south quivered. Parted. Something was coming through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s heart seemed to freeze solid, but then he found himself moving. Pushing Jade roughly aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in front of her to face whatever the thing in the dark was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette kicked her way through the blackberry canes. Her arms and legs were scratched, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe could feel ripe, bright-black berries squishing against her. She\u0027d probably picked a bad place to get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the hedge, but she hadn\u0027t been thinking about that. She\u0027d been thinking about Mark, aboutfinding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim as fast as possible and getting away from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0Just please let him be here, she thought. Let him be here and be okay and I\u0027ll never ask for anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled through the last of the canes into thebackyard-and then things happened very fast. The first\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ething she saw was Mark, and she felt a rush of relief. Then a flash of surprise. Mark was standing in front\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a girl, his arms lifted like a basketball guard. As if to protect her from Mary-Lynnette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, so quickly that Mary-Lynnette could barely follow the motion, the girl was rushing at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Mary-Lynnette was throwing her arms up and Mark was shouting, \"No, that\u0027s my sister!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl stopped a foot away from Mary-Lynnette.It was the little silvery-haired one, of course. This\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edose Mary-Lynnette couldsee that she had green eyes and skin so translucent it almost looked like quartz\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, it\u0027s my sister,\".Mark said again, as if anxiousto get this established. \"Her name\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette.She won\u0027t hurt you. Mare, tell her you won\u0027t hurther.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurt her? Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know what he wastalking about, and didn\u0027t want to. This girl was as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweirdly beautiful as the others, and something abouther eyes-hey weren\u0027t ordinary green, but almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilvery-made Mary-Lynnette\u0027s skin rise ingoose pimples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello. Okay, Mark, c\u0027mon. We\u0027ve got to go. Like right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expected him to agree immediately. He wasthe one who hadn\u0027t wanted to come, and now herehe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas with his most dreaded phobia, a girl. But instead he said, \"Did you hear that yelling? Could you tell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere it came from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What yelling? I was inside. Come on.\" MaryLynnette took Mark\u0027s arm, but since he was as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrongas she was, it didn\u0027t do any good. \"Maybe I heardsomething. I wasn\u0027t paying attention.\" She\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooking desperately around the Victorian living room,babbling out lies about how her family knew where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d gone tonight and expected her back soon. How her father and stepmother were such good friends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof Mrs. Burdock\u0027s and how they were just waiting at home to hear about Mrs. B.\u0027s nieces. She still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t sure if that was why they\u0027d let her go. But for somereason, Rowan had finally stood up, given\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryLynnette a grave, sweet smile, and opened the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I bet it was a wolverine,\" Mark was saying to Jade excitedly. \"A wolverine that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecame down from Willamette Forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was frowning. \"A wolverine?\" She considered. \"Yeah, I guess that could have been it. I\u0027ve never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheard one before.\" She looked at MaryLynnette. \"Is that what you think it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" Mary-Lynnette said at random. \"Definitely a wolverine.\" I should ask where her aunt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis, she thought suddenly. It\u0027s the perfect opportunity to catch her in a lie. I\u0027ll ask and then she\u0027llsay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething-anything, but not that her aunt\u0027sgone up north for a little vacation on the coast. And then I\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t do it. She simply didn\u0027t have the courage. She didn\u0027t want to catch anyone in a lie anymore;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe just wanted to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, please ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her and for the first time seemed tosee how upset she was. \"Uh-okay,\" he said. And to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade: \"Look, why don\u0027t you go back inside now?You\u0027ll be safe there. And maybe-maybe I could come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover again sometime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette was still tugging at him, and now, to her relief, he began to move. Mary-Lynnette headed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor the blackberry bushes that she\u0027d trampled coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go through there? It\u0027s like apath,\" Jadesaid,pointing. Mark immediately swerved,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etaking Mary-Lynnette with him, and she saw a comfortable gap between two rhododendron bushes at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe back of the garden. She would never have seen it unless she knew what to look for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached the hedge, Mark turned to glance behind him. Mary-Lynnette turned, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom here, Jade was just a dark silhouette againstthe porch light-but her hair, lit from behind, looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike a silver halo. It shimmered around her. MaryLynnette heard Mark draw in his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You both come back sometime,\" Jade said cordially. \"Help us milk the goats like Aunt Opal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid. She gave us very strict orders before she went on vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette was dumbfounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back and reeled through the gap, her head spinning. When they got to the road she said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, what happened when you got into the garden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark was looking preoccupied. \"What do you mean what happened? Nothing happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you look at the place that was dug up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mark said shortly. \"Jade was in the gardenwhen I got there. I didn\u0027t get a chance to look at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark ... was she there the whole time? Jade?Did she ever go in the house? Or did either of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother girls ever come out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark grunted. \"I don\u0027t even know what the othergirls look like. The only one I saw was Jade, and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas there the whole time.\" He looked at her darkly. \"You\u0027re not still on this Rear Windowthing, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette didn\u0027t answer. She was trying to gather her scattered thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe it. Butshe said it. Orders about the goats. Before her aunt went on vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rowan didn\u0027t know about the goats before I told her. I\u0027d swear she didn\u0027t know. And I was so sure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was winging it with the vacation business....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, maybe I was wrong. But that doesn\u0027t mean Rowan was telling the truth. Maybe they didfigure the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estory out before tonight, and Rowan\u0027s just a lousy actress. Or maybe ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0 \"Mark, this is going to sound crazy ... but Jade didn\u0027t have, like, a cellular phone or anything, did\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark stopped dead and gave Mary-Lynnette a long, slow look that said more dearly than wordswhat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe thought of this. \"Mary-Lynnette, what\u0027swrongwith you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rowan and Kestrel told me that Mrs. B. is on vacation. That she suddenly decidedto take a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evacation just when they arrived in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? Jade said the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, Mrs. B. has lived there for ten years, and she\u0027s nevertaken a vacation. Never. How could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshetake one starting the same day her nieces come to live with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe because they can house-sit for her,\" Mark said with devastating logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was exactly what Rowanhad said. MaryLynnette had a sudden feeling of paranoia, like someone who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erealizes that everyone around her is a pod person, all in on the conspiracy. She had been aboutto tell him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout the goats, but now she didn\u0027t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, geta gripon yourself, girl. Even Mark is beinglogical The least you can do isthink about this rationally\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore you run to Sheriff Akers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact is, Mary-Lynnette told herself, brutally honest, that you panicked. You got afeelingaboutthose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirls for some reason, and then you forgot logic completely. You didn\u0027t get any kind of hard evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ran away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hardly go to the sheriff and. say that shewas suspicious because Rowan had creepy feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no evidence at all. Nothing except ... She groaned inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all comes down to what\u0027s in the garden,\" shesaid out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark, who had been walking beside her in frowning silence, now stopped. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all comes back to that again,\" Mary-Lynnettesaid, her eyes shut. \"I should have just looked at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethatdug-up place when I had the chance, even if Jadesaw me. It\u0027s the only real evidence there is ...so I\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egot to see what\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark was shaking his head. \"Now, look-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haveto go back. Not tonight. I\u0027m dead tired. But tomorrow. Mark, I haveto check it out before I go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto Sheriff Akers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before youwhat?\"he shouted, loud enough to raise echoes. \"What are you talking about, going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto the sheriff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stared. She hadn\u0027t realized how different Mark\u0027s point of view was from hers. Why, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought, why he\u0027s ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-240 \"You wanted to check out where Mrs. B. was-so we checked where Mrs. B. was,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told us where. And yousawJade. I know she\u0027s a little differentit\u0027s like you said about Mrs. B.; she\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeccentric. But did she look like the kind of personwho could hurt somebody? Well, didshe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, he\u0027s in love with her, Mary-Lynnettethought. Or at least seriously in like. Mark likes a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was reallyconfused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be so good for him-if only the girl weren\u0027t crazy. Well, maybe even if the girl wascrazyif it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t a homicidal craziness. Either way, Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t call the police on Mark\u0027s new girlfriend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunless she had some evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if she likes him, too? she thought. They certainly seemed to be protecting each other when I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewalked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re right,\" she said aloud, glad that she\u0027d had practice lying tonight. \"She doesn\u0027t look\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike thekind of person who could hurt somebody. I\u0027ll just let it drop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith you. And tomorrow night when you thinkI\u0027m starwatching, I\u0027ll sneak over there. This time bringing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emy own shovel. And maybe a big stick to fend off wolverines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think you heard a wolverine over there?\" she asked, to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um ...maybe.\" Mark was slowly losing his scowl. \"It was somethingweird. Something I\u0027ve never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheard before. So you\u0027re going to forget all this crazy stuff about Mrs. B., right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I am.\" I\u0027ll be safe, mary-Lynnette was thinking. This time I won\u0027t panic, and I\u0027ll make sure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey don\u0027t see me. Besides, if they were going to kill me, they would have done it tonight, wouldn\u0027t they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it was Sasquatch we heard yelling,\" Marksaid. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-5.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM"}
