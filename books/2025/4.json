After the long flight - chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky - it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been very quiet,\" Edward observed. \"Did the plane make you sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sad to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More relieved than sad, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and - much as I hated to admit it - unnecessary to ask him to keep his eyes on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ren��e is so much more . . . perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me jumpy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward laughed. \"Your mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees things differently than other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsightful. It was a good description of my mother - when she was paying attention. Most of the time Ren��e was so bewildered by her own life that she didn\u0027t notice much else. But this weekend she\u0027d been paying plenty of attention to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil was busy - the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs - and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Ren��e\u0027s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Ren��e began to watch. And as she\u0027d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis morning we\u0027d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She\u0027d also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my head, I went through the conversation again. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRen��e and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, not meeting my gaze. \"I\u0027m worried. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, anxious at once. \"What can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not me.\" She shook her head. \"I\u0027m worried about you . . . and Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRen��e finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two are more serious than I\u0027d been thinking,\" she went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched - in front of her, at least. I wondered if Ren��e was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn\u0027t mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn\u0027t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I\u0027d been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,\" she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. \"The way he watches you - it\u0027s so . . . protective. Like he\u0027s about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. \"That\u0027s a bad thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She frowned as she struggled for the words. \"It\u0027s just different. He\u0027s very intense about you . . . and very careful. I feel like I don\u0027t really understand your relationship. Like there\u0027s some secret I\u0027m missing. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re imagining things, Mom,\" I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I\u0027d forgotten how much my mother saw. Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn\u0027t tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just him.\" She set her lips defensively. \"I wish you could see how you move around him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way you move - you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You\u0027re like a . . . satellite, or something. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pursed her lips and stared down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me,\" I teased, forcing a smile. \"You\u0027re reading mysteries again, aren\u0027t you? Or is it sci-fi this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRen��e flushed a delicate pink. \"That\u0027s beside the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found anything good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there was one - but that doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027re talking about you right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips turned up at the corners. \"I\u0027m being silly, aren\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor half a second I couldn\u0027t answer. Ren��e was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing, especially since she was dead right this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, and I controlled my expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not silly - just being a mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all this isn\u0027t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get used to the humidity,\" she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can get used to rain, too,\" I countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo- goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn\u0027t miss me that much, even now. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down and kissed my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were stopped in front of Charlie\u0027s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellow light across the dark lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote as he came to get my door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How bad?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie\u0027s not going to be difficult,\" Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. \"He missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome home, kid!\" Charlie shouted like he really meant it. \"How was Jacksonville?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moist. And buggy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Ren��e didn\u0027t sell you on the University of Florida?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She tried. But I\u0027d rather drink water than inhale it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. \"Did you have a nice time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Edward answered in a serene voice. \"Ren��e was very hospitable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.\" Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impressive,\" I whispered in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rumbled a laugh. \"I really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get on it,\" I said as he let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you call Jacob first? He\u0027s been bugging me every five minutes since six o\u0027clock this morning. I promised I\u0027d have you call him before you even unpacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob wants to talk to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty bad, I\u0027d say. He wouldn\u0027t tell me what it was about - just said it was important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang then, shrill and demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s him again, I\u0027d bet my next paycheck,\" Charlie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got it.\" I hurried to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re back,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together - a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through my darkest night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared the lump from my throat. \"Yes,\" I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you call me?\" Jacob demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis angry tone instantly got my back up. \"Because I\u0027ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour call interrupted Charlie telling me that you\u0027d called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to school tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. \"Of course I am. Why wouldn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno. Just curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did you want to talk about, Jake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"Nothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know. I\u0027m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .\" But I didn\u0027t know what more to say. I wanted to tell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn\u0027t tell him that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" he said abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll talk to you soon, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Jake -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was short,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything all right?\" Edward asked. His voice was low and careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth - impossible to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I wonder what that was about.\" It didn\u0027t make sense that Jacob had been hounding Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he\u0027d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he hang up so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your guess is probably better than mine,\" Edward said, the hint of a smiletugging at the corner of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn\u0027t be that complicated to figure out his motivations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my thoughts miles away - about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push - I started combing through the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie\u0027s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to be after an answer to something, or he wouldn\u0027t have been bugging Charlie so persistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would my attendance record matter to him, though?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn\u0027t been going to school tomorrow, what would be the problem with that, from Jacob\u0027s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of school so close to finals, but I\u0027d convinced him that one Friday wasn\u0027t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardly care about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his long streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days could change everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn\u0027t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn\u0027t be anywhere near people after I\u0027d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I could spend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Charlie told Billy that I\u0027d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob really been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves\u0027 treaty was unbroken - that none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shook me. \"Bella?\" he asked, truly anxious now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think . . . I think he was checking,\" I mumbled. \"Checking to make sure. That I\u0027m human, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to leave,\" I whispered. \"Before. So that it doesn\u0027t break the treaty. We won\u0027t ever be able to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms tightened around me. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahem.\" Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped, and then pulled free of Edward\u0027s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,\" Charlie hinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s okay, I\u0027m already started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I asked you to do something, would you trust me?\" Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at his anxious expression - his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. \"That depends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled into the school lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was afraid you would say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to do, Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to stay in the car.\" He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. \"I want you to wait here until I come back for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . . why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did, even if he hadn\u0027t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined to keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam always exuded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I\u0027d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens had come back - to like him, even - I\u0027d never been able to completely shake the resentment I felt when Jacob mimicked Sam\u0027s expression. It was a stranger\u0027s face. He wasn\u0027t my Jacob when he wore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,\" Edward murmured. \"He asked about school because he knew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027d misinterpreted Jacob\u0027s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Information like why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not staying in the car,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward groaned quietly. \"Of course not. Well, let\u0027s get this over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed other faces, too - the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob\u0027s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt - short-sleeved, though the day was unseasonably cool - his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Their eyes didn\u0027t linger on his face - something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have called us,\" Edward said in a steel-hard voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. \"I don\u0027t have any leeches on my speed dial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have reached me at Bella\u0027s house, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure. I\u0027ll stop by your crypt after school.\" Jacob snorted. \"What\u0027s wrong with now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their way to class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know what you came to say,\" Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely make it out. \"Message delivered. Consider us warned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Warned?\" I asked blankly. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t tell her?\" Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. \"What, were you afraid she\u0027d take our side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please drop it, Jacob,\" Edward said in an even voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Jacob challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned in confusion. \"What don\u0027t I know? Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn\u0027t heard me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob raised his eyebrow at me. \"He didn\u0027t tell you that his big . . . brother crossed the line Saturday night?\" he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. \"Paul was totally justified in -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was no-man\u0027s land!\" Edward hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emmett and Paul?\" I whispered. Paul was Jacob\u0027s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who\u0027d lost control that day in the woods - the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vividin my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? Were they fighting?\" My voice strained higher in panic. \"Why? Did Paul get hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one fought,\" Edward said quietly, only to me. \"No one got hurt. Don\u0027t be anxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. \"You didn\u0027t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why you took her away? So she wouldn\u0027t know that -?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave now.\" Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening - truly frightening. For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire. He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. \"Why haven\u0027t you told her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I saw Mike next to Ben - Mike had one hand on Ben\u0027s shoulder, like he was holding him in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething Edward didn\u0027t want me to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that Jacob wouldn\u0027t have kept from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that Alice had seen in a vision last week - a vision Edward had lied to me about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething I\u0027d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it never would. It was never going to end, was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn\u0027t stop it. It looked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that caused the illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She came back for me,\" I choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern - feint and run, feint and run - until she found a hole through my defenders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0027d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first - they\u0027d kill me quicker, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked my face with anxious hands. \"It\u0027s fine,\" he whispered to me. \"It\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll never let her get close to you, it\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he glared at Jacob. \"Does that answer your question, mongrel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think Bella has a right to know?\" Jacob challenged. \"It\u0027s her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. \"Why should she be frightened when she was never in danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better frightened than lied to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids - I could see Victoria\u0027s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn\u0027t stop until his love was taken from him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s tougher than you think,\" Jacob said. \"And she\u0027s been through worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Jacob\u0027s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For one ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I\u0027d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s funny,\" Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn\u0027t quite hide the agony in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward\u0027s grimace to Jacob\u0027s sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing to him?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing, Bella,\" Edward told me quietly. \"Jacob just has a good memory, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob grinned, and Edward winced again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! Whatever you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, if you want.\" Jacob shrugged. \"It\u0027s his own fault if he doesn\u0027t like the things I remember, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him, and he smiled back impishly - like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn\u0027t by someone who he knows won\u0027t punish him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The principal\u0027s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,\" Edward murmured to me. \"Let\u0027s get to English, Bella, so you\u0027re not involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overprotective, isn\u0027t he?\" Jacob said, talking just to me. \"A little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, you\u0027re not allowed to have fun, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Jake,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob laughed. \"That sounds like a no. Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come see me. I\u0027ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis news distracted me. \"You were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.\" If I hadn\u0027t begged on Jake\u0027s behalf - after all, he\u0027d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some kind of payback - Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I\u0027ll hold on to it until you want it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. \"I think I might have been wrong before, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line. Come see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. I shot a look at his face - it was calm, patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, er, don\u0027t know about that, Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob dropped the antagonistic faade completely. It was like he\u0027d forgotten Edward was there, or at least he was determined to act that way. \"I miss you every day, Bella. It\u0027s not the same without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know and I\u0027m sorry, Jake, I just . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, and sighed. \"I know. Doesn\u0027t matter, right? I guess I\u0027ll survive or something. Who needs friends?\" He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational - Jacob was hardly in need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward\u0027s, yearned to reach out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s shielding arms had become restraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, get to class,\" a stern voice sounded behind us. \"Move along, Mr. Crowley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get to school, Jake,\" I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal\u0027s voice. Jacob went to the Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover his small eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it,\" he was threatening. \"Detention for anyone who\u0027s still standing here when I turn around again.\" The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent. I don\u0027t seem to recognize your friend.\" Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. \"Are you a new student here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Greene\u0027s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he\u0027d come to the same conclusion everyone else had: dangerous. A troublemaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope,\" Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn\u0027t the smile I\u0027d been waiting to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob said, \"Yes, sir,\" and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I\u0027ll pass along the warning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward\u0027s perfect grades and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr. Greene\u0027s assessment of the incident. \"I see. If you\u0027re worried about any trouble, I\u0027d be happy to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won\u0027t be any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope that\u0027s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel well enough to go to class?\" he whispered when we were past the principal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward right away, and English class wasn\u0027t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren\u0027t a lot of other options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal thanks to my agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened? Tell me everything. And screw the protecting me crap, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution - there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn\u0027t help that Alice\u0027s abilities were nullified by the Quileutes\u0027 involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn\u0027t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That\u0027s everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it - Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn\u0027t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Any one of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about Charlie? She could have been after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie\u0027s behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0027t know that she wasn\u0027t thinking that, because you weren\u0027t here. Florida was a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the paper from underneath my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d meant at all; I hadn\u0027t thought of going without him. I\u0027d meant that we should have stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn\u0027t fly cross country without bringing the plane down. Very funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo let\u0027s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it? Why is the plane crashing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trying to hide a smile now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilots are passed out drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy. I\u0027d fly the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. I pursed my lips and tried again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth engines have exploded and we\u0027re falling in a death spiral toward the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, and jump. Then I\u0027d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we\u0027d stumble around like the two luckiest survivors in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head in awe. \"Nothing,\" I mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line. You will tell me next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like - it felt cold, so the blood hadn\u0027t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and then nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinkingin surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that something you\u0027d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. \"My notes?\" he asked, sounding confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Berty scanned the notes - no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture - and then walked away frowning. It was later, in Calculus - my one class without Edward - that I heard the gossip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My money\u0027s on the big Indian,\" someone was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Mike whispered. \"Did you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.\" Mike sounded pleased by the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Ben disagreed. \"There\u0027s something about Edward. He\u0027s always so . . . confident. I have a feeling he can take care of himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with Ben,\" Tyler agreed. \"Besides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers of his would get involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been down to La Push lately?\" Mike asked. \"Lauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago, and believe me, Jacob\u0027s friends are all just as big as he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" Tyler said. \"Too bad it didn\u0027t turn into anything. Guess we\u0027ll never know how it would have turned out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t look over to me,\" Austin said. \"Maybe we\u0027ll get to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike grinned. \"Anyone in the mood for a bet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten on Jacob,\" Austin said at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten on Cullen,\" Tyler chimed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten on Edward,\" Ben agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob,\" Mike said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, do you guys know what it was about?\" Austin wondered. \"That might affect the odds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can guess,\" Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom their expressions, none of them had realized I was in easy hearing distance. They all looked away quickly, shuffling the papers on their desks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still say Jacob,\" Mike muttered under his breath. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-4.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
