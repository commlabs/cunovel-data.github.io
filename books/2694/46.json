For takin’ my boy away. I lost my faith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Hotchkiss had always been a man of faith, not merely paying lip service to being a Christian. He’d tried to lead his life according to God’s rules and by example, expecting his family to follow suit. It hadn’t been the easiest way to grow up, but she hadn’t questioned it. Not until RJ had died. Although she’d veered away from the teachings of the church, she still didn’t judge those people who abided by the tenets of their religions, just as long as they didn’t try and push their beliefs on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo his response about losing his faith startled her—maybe that’s why her father had become so unrecognizable in the wake of RJ’s death. He’d had no one to turn to. So he’d turned on everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the worst part?” he continued in a small voice. “Because of that anger, I also lost your mom. And you. I lost everything and everyone that mattered to me.” He looked down. “It ain’t right. And I don’t know what I can do to make it right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither do I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m willing to do anything, Georgia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did it mean that he wanted to try and make amends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone buzzed, reminding her of her next appointment. She said, “Dad, I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand. Thanks for makin’ my day. I…hate that it’s this way between us. I don’t know you as an adult, Georgie. That makes me sadder than anything in the world,” he said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely at a loss, Georgia mumbled, “See you,” and practically ran out of the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell’s week started out on a sour note and went downhill from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t seen Georgia at all on Monday and when he called her, she sounded preoccupied, although she swore she was just tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday night was a wash. She’d invited him to her place after his dart game ended, but the way she’d gone on about how much fun she’d had with the new people she’d met and the old friends she’d reconnected with had brought out a jealous streak and he’d just gone home. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday night was Georgia’s girls’ night with Stephanie. And Leah and Roxanne. And a bunch of other women. Evidently she’d had a great time, a fact he’d heard Thursday morning from Ned. And even Dalton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeren’t you the one who encouraged her to cut loose? Have fun. Make friends. Get involved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. Might make him paranoid, but now that Georgia had found a new crowd, maybe a cooler crowd, was she ditching him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe niggling doubt was confirmed Thursday night when Tell tracked Georgia down at the Golden Boot—thirty minutes after they were supposed to meet for supper at Fields. He leaned against the wall and watched her as she chatted with the mayor, the superintendent of schools, the owner of the local real estate company, and the lawyer for a methane gas company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll single men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll gazing at Georgia with lust-filled eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll dead men, as far as Tell was concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut rather than storming over and hauling her ass out like he had before, he hung back. Just as he had in high school. Waiting for her to notice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re still a wannabe, McKay. Nothing has changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullshit. But tuning out that voice of doubt and reminding himself to act like a mature adult in this relationship didn’t spur his feet to move. He was stuck in hell, seeing Georgia laughing with these clowns, oblivious to the fact she’d missed their date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes passed while he remained in the shadows, nursing a beer. Thirty long minutes in which he didn’t cross Georgia’s mind once because she’d made no effort to contact him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobering and humbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe texted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must’ve mixed up my nights. Thought we had a date at Fields. I’m tired and going home. Catch up with you later. T~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was perverted, but he hung around to see her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia fished out her cell from the pocket of her suit jacket and glanced at the screen. Guilt crossed her face and she swore. She immediately began punching buttons. Soon after his phone buzzed in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was tonight. Sorry! I didn’t mean to stand you up. I got sidetracked. Are you still waiting at Fields?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell waited a solid five minutes before he responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo worries. We’ll go another night. Got a busy day tomorrow anyway. See you @ the Pine Haven Rodeo Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia frowned and texted furiously, ignoring the men at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m really sorry. Can I come out to your place and make you supper?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably made him a petty dick, but he just wanted to be mad at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I can’t text and drive, so I gotta go. See you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell finished his beer. Wondering if Georgia would stay at the bar and drink with these guys or if she’d head home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t stick around to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dreamt of her that night. Dreamt of being back in high school. Dreamt of being invisible. Dreamt of gazing at her adoringly from the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia. Beautiful, perfect Georgia. His Georgia. Not the unattainable Georgia from the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approached her in the lunchroom. But she wouldn’t deign to look in his direction or even speak to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her hair and called her name in history class, but she wouldn’t acknowledge him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next dream frame, Georgia was surrounded by his cousins. Strong, strapping McKays. With those black Irish good looks. Rich men. Successful ranchers. Oozing confidence. Spreading charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he wormed his way through the throng to get to her, he was roughly jerked back. Put in his place at the end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She doesn’t want you,” Kade sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She never has, she never will,” Colby hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s too good for you,” Colt added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ain’t man enough to handle her,” Ben warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s using you, and you’re a loser who lets her,” Dalton said with derision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father appeared—all mean attitude and ugliness. “You’re an embarrassment to the McKay name.” Casper turned his back on Tell, shunning him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, one by one, his McKay relatives started laughing at him. Pointing. Whispering. Making fun. Taunting him. He tried to run away but his feet were buried in the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real kick in the balls came when Georgia looked at him with pity and contempt. “You didn’t really think you had a shot at me, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke up angry. Irrational anger from a stupid dream, but he hated there were some truths in his fears. That he’d never be good enough for her. In her eyes and everyone else’s eyes. Truths that made him feel raw and helpless. Truths that made him a little desperate to dispel those fears by any means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChores kept him hopping all Friday morning. So when his caller ID said Chase, he almost didn’t answer, but curiosity got the better of him. “Omigod! Is this really Chase McKay? World champion PBR bull rider? Callin’ me? I’m so honored!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it is, and why don’t you just go ahead and pucker up to kiss my famous butt for that smart-ass comment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell laughed. “What’s up, cuz?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be in town for the Upton Rodeo tomorrow afternoon. Pressing the flesh, passing the word about safety helmets. I got to talkin’ to Verna, the Upton Rodeo secretary, and she told me they’re short a judge for tomorrow. I told her I’d call and see if you’re interested in subbing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell yes he was interested. Then it hit him. He couldn’t. It was too bad Georgia had hired him to work the Pine Haven Rodeo tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s too bad Georgia has blown you off all fucking week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. Seemed his subconscious was still bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the bottom line was the Upton Rodeo was a PRCA-sanctioned event. More money, more prestige than a dinky-ass nothing rodeo. Not to mention he’d get to share the spotlight with his celebrity cousin for an afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one would fault him for taking this opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Georgia might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she could just suck it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell? You there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Sorry. That sounds great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awesome. I’m sure you know the drill by now. Lookin’ forward to seein’ you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia didn’t check her phone Saturday morning until after she’d weeded her vegetable garden, showered and finished half a pot of coffee. She smiled, seeing a text from Tell at six a.m. She loved the pictures he’d text from his early morning ranch chores. Or just the sweet things he’d text because he’d been thinking about her. Those messages had been scarce the last three days. She’d just chalked it up to them both being busy. She scrolled through the text:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry, but I have to back out of judging the Pine Haven Rodeo today. A family thing came up—don’t worry it’s not serious and I’ll text you when I can. T~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she supposed to do now? Two judges were the minimum requirement. She tried eight numbers on the judges list and no one was available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when she panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink, Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne solution occurred to her. She dismissed it. Several times. Until she just went ahead and made the call, pacing as the line kept ringing. Then a gruff voice said, “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Dad. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Georgie! I’m okay. I’m happy to hear from you. What’s goin’ on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Deck around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. Then, “Oh. You didn’t call to talk to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hopeful tone had dimmed and she felt guilty. “I’m actually in a time crunch. I need to talk to Deck and I didn’t have his number. It’s strictly a business question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Georgia, dear, is there coffee left?” her mother trilled as she entered the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother is in Sundance?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I told you she planned to visit. Now is Deck around or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. He’s here. Hang on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuffled voices mixed with the sounds of hogs going hog wild in the background and then Deck came on the line. “Robert said you needed to talk to me?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissin-tell-rough-riders-13/page-46.html","bookId":2694,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM"}
