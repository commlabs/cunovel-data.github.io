Unnaturally quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, coming from all around them, she could hear the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex paced in the entry hall, waiting for Cody to come back from the saloon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t keep giving so much blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sensed someone behind her and spun around. It was the young priest from the Episcopal church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe your friend will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed. \"I\u0027m praying that all of us will make it, Father. I\u0027m amazed-and glad, of course-that you and the others were able to survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had the church, and the church gave us comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Alex replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A church is not just a building. It\u0027s consecrated, and we filled it with belief. That\u0027s what we all need if we\u0027re to survive, Miss Gordon, belief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex frowned. \"Belief, yes, but...still, some of the dead must have come after you. How did you know-I mean, frankly, not many men would suspect vampires, much less know how to kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the gentleman who led the others to the church who warned me. I thought at first that he was a madman, but when Timmy told me how his own father tried to rip his throat out, I believed, and quickly. The man explained to me that we had to rely on belief, on faith. He spoke like a scholar, and he explained to me how the vampires had to be killed. I begged him to stay, but after he explained to us how to melt what silver we had and form it into bullets, then dip them in holy water, he left. I never saw him again. No doubt those monsters killed him. And yet none of us would have survived without his help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man who had saved Father Joseph and his small flock spoke well, almost like a scholar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man just like her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart began to hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Joseph, you said that you were new to Hollow Tree. When did you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Alice-she lived in Hollow Tree a long time, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex didn\u0027t answer. She burst through to the kitchen, where the women were making the final preparations to serve dinner. Alice was shucking peas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice?\" Alex said, striding over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman straightened the pair of spectacles on her nose and looked up expectantly. \"Yes, Miss Gordon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man who brought you to the church-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not me. I was already there, practicing my piano for the Sunday services. Would have been mighty nice to have an organ, but out here, we make do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex drew out a chair and sat down next to the older woman. \"Please, this is important. Did you know that man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice inhaled and stared back at her, then shook her head. \"No, no, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Alex pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond disappointed, Alex stood, thanked the woman and left the room, returning to the front hall, where she posted herself at the window and stared out into the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted Cody and Brendan to come back. And she wanted to know what had happened. Jigs, a sweet, harmless man if ever there was one...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had one of the creatures gotten to him? There had been sentries on duty at the saloon every night. The only way someone could have gotten to him was from...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt as if her blood suddenly froze in her veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda. It had to be Linda. Her own stepmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda, who hadn\u0027t been there the night of the first attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho came and went...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get back over to the saloon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she turned away from the window, she saw Adam Jefferies standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you were trying to find out, Miss Gordon,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" she asked carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t remember me-you only met me once, when your father brought you with him to the bank where I work. Worked. Your father kept some extra funds with us, said that way he\u0027d have something left if one bank got hit by robbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Alex apologized, wondering where all this was leading. \"I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" Jefferies said. \"You want to know if the man who brought us to the church was your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled sharply, hope filling her. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. He had a bandanna over his face, and he wore his hat low. And he was...so pale, almost ghostly, what I could see of him. But his voice...his voice reminded me of your father\u0027s. I didn\u0027t really think about it, though, because I thought your father was dead, but thinking back...well, I just don\u0027t know. It might have been your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father! And he had been saving people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Mr. Jefferies. She was pretty sure he almost fainted when she crossed the foyer toward him, grasped his head between her hands and planted a kiss right on his lips. At the very least, his blush was several shades deeper than sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really can\u0027t say for sure,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s something,\" she whispered. \"Though...you might not want to mention this to anyone else....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell the others I\u0027m going over to the saloon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Is that wise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The others are still there, and they\u0027ll look out for me. But if you wouldn\u0027t mind...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you watch me, see that I make it safely? Don\u0027t take any chances yourself, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Gordon, I\u0027ll be happy to stand guard for you, and you don\u0027t have to be afraid. Father Joseph may be a gentle man, but he\u0027s proved to be an amazing warrior for Christ, and he\u0027s trained his small army quite well.\" With that, Jefferies walked her to the door, opened it and said again, \"I\u0027ll be watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, then turned and raced across the street. He watched her all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they both watched the darkening sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC ODY STAYED WITH J IGS for a long time after he had transfused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan had gone down to join Dave, Cole, Roscoe and the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody just sat and watched Jigs, and he didn\u0027t rise until he heard someone enter the saloon downstairs. He listened, frowning as he realized that it was Alex. He listened to her climb the stairs, opened the door to greet her, then paused. She wasn\u0027t on her way to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped at a door down the hall and pounded on it. \"Linda!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. Linda stood there, looking worn and disheveled. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you the night the town was attacked?\" Alex demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me just fine,\" Alex snapped. \"Where were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t out turning people into vampires, and I never touched Jigs, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking me,\" Linda told her heatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex\u0027s hands were on her hips. \"You married my father. And right after that, he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment it looked as if Linda was going to take a swing at Alex, who looked as if she was barely hang ing on to her self-control and no doubt would have swung back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Dave called from below. \"This isn\u0027t the time for a fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda managed to control herself. \"I loved your father, Alex. But you go right ahead and think whatever you want about me.\" She started to close her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex slammed a hand against it. \"If anyone else is hurt, if Jigs dies, you\u0027ll pay. I\u0027ll make sure you pay myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex!\" Cody strode down the hall and caught her by the arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda glared at them both, then closed her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex,\" Cody said again, spinning her around to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? It\u0027s Linda-it has to be Linda who tried to turn Jigs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She married my father, and my father is dead!\" Alex said angrily. \"Or-or a thing. And you\u0027re going to try to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, we have to find Milo Roundtree and kill him,\" Cody told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Right. And after you\u0027ve killed him, you\u0027ll have to go after the others. All the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex...\" He couldn\u0027t find the words to explain, not there. He called downstairs. \"Brendan? Can you watch Jigs for a while?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure thing,\" Brendan said, already on his way up the stairs. He tipped his hat to Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brendan,\" she said, and smiled at him as he kept going down the hall to Jigs\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the tension seemed to be easing from her, Cody thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Cody said. \"Let\u0027s get some time alone, and something to eat.\" For a moment he thought she was going to fight him. That she was going to protest and carry on trying to prove that Linda was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she only stared back at him, still tense, but reasonable. \"All right. For now,\" she said. \"But you\u0027ve got to warn the sheriff, Cody. You\u0027ve got to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brendan\u0027s already warned him that...that someone here isn\u0027t exactly what they seem,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went down the stairs together. Cole looked up and nodded at Cody as they passed, the movement barely perceptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they left the saloon, Cody stopped and gazed up at the sky. Night had fallen, but there was a red haze over the moon, which was almost full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow someone needs to get out to John Snow. He and his family need to come into town for the next few days,\" Cody said, thinking out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Alex asked him sharply. \"Because the moon is nearly full?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her and nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Milo will be at his most powerful then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made it across the street without incident. The boardinghouse door opened as they neared it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Bert, just keeping guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are,\" he said, relieved. \"Beulah was getting worried. Everyone else is in the dining room, eating, but Tess just took trays up to your rooms. Beulah figured you two might be needing some rest. She made up a sack of food for everyone over at the saloon, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s kind of her. Let me have the sack and I\u0027ll run it over right now,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex frowned. \"We just got back, Cody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on upstairs, Alex. This will only take me a minute,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw tightened, but she didn\u0027t argue. Wearily, she started up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"THIS IS GREAT-THANKS,\" Dave said enthusiastically when Cody showed up with the food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll run a couple of plates up to Brendan-and Linda,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can handle it,\" Cole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody nodded. \"I know you can, but I\u0027d like to look in on Jigs, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody made up two plates and headed up the stairs. Linda\u0027s door was closed, so he passed it and went to Jigs\u0027s room first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s he doing?\" he asked Brendan as he handed over dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hasn\u0027t moved since you left. But his pulse is strong, and his color is better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he makes it through the night, he\u0027ll be fine. I think. When you get tired of sitting here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have Cole or Dave spell me,\" Brendan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody nodded and headed down the hall to tap on Linda\u0027s door. She answered it looking tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you some dinner,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashed him a smile of gratitude, with nothing of her usual seductive air. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get some rest after you eat,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying, trust me,\" she said, then closed the door in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody stared at the closed door for a moment, then turned and headed back downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda took the plate of food and set it on her bedside table. It smelled delicious, and she was certainly hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was also worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the man who stepped away from his hiding place behind the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t safe,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s necessary,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LEX MEANT TO WAIT FOR C ODY to start eating, but the aroma coming from her plate was too tempting. She hadn\u0027t realized she was starving until then, but now the only thing she could think of was eating. She sat down on the edge of the mattress and dug in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t taken more than a few bites, though, before he arrived bearing his own plate, and a bottle of elderberry wine. He lifted it, and she shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks good,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the chair at her dressing table and started eating as if he, too, had suddenly discovered that he was ravenous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, I think Linda is...infected.\" Before he could answer, she added, \"Think about it. She\u0027s in and out of town, and no one really knows where she goes when she\u0027s not here. I get the sense she\u0027s conniving and manipulative. I think she killed my father. And you\u0027re wrong about him, too. I heard what happened in Hollow Tree. Someone saved those people in the middle of the massacre. Someone who knew. Someone who taught them how to deal with vampires. Cody, I think that man was a vampire himself, but he was strong and didn\u0027t turn evil. I talked to Mr. Jefferies, and he knew my father and thinks it could have been him. Don\u0027t you see? It had to be my father, and there has to be a way to reach him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody stood, setting his plate down, and paced over to the window, where he stared at the drapes as if he could see through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and hurried to join him. \"Cody, it has to be my father. It has to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set his hands on her shoulders, staring into her eyes. \"No, Alex,\" he said sadly, \"it doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think I understand how you feel? No,\" he said, shaking his head, \"no, of course you don\u0027t, because...\" He met her eyes, his own dark with the intensity of his gaze. \"Alex, I keep thinking, praying, that it was my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped, stunned, and backed away from him. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a sigh, turned and strode toward the bed, where he stopped with his back to her. Finally he turned to face her. \"You don\u0027t know,\" he said softly, \"because I haven\u0027t told you. God knows I keep the truth from the world as much as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Cody. What truth?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was born in New Orleans, Alex, but I was conceived out here, on a ranch near Victory. It still exists, and I still own it-the land, and what\u0027s left of a bunch of fallen-down, rotting buildings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does that mean?\" Alex asked. She felt an overwhelming sense of dread, but at the same time, she wanted to know the truth, everything, no matter what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"This...war didn\u0027t just start. And this isn\u0027t the only place vampires have tried to take hold. It\u0027s just easier out here, where one of them can slip into a town and make a meal of the population.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve hunted vampires before. Obviously,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked back to her and set his hands on her shoulders. He looked into her eyes, and when he spoke, it was sadly, his voice filled with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, I am a vampire.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-of-the-wolves-vampire-hunters-1/page-16.html","bookId":2698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM"}
