It was amazing, all the weird and wondrous things you could find for sale there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, her passion was books. The boxes she was opening now contained a collection of books she had purchased from a seller on eBay who claimed that the books had originally belonged to the \u0027 seller\u0027s great-great-grandmother, who had been a practicing witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerafina removed the books from the boxes reverently. One by one, she thumbed through them, thrilled with what she saw. The books were indeed old and rare, some so old they had been written in longhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne especially caught her eye. It was a book of ancient mystical blood rituals. There were spells for curing warts and insomnia and for healing a variety of illnesses, most of which no longer existed. There were love spells, of course. What witch hadn\u0027t been approached for a charm that would win the love of another? The last part of the book was dedicated to dark Magick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerafina hesitated to turn the page. She had been taught that witchcraft should only be used for good, but curiosity finally won out. She turned the pages, scanning them quickly, until she came to the last page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words seemed to blur before her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Incantation to Raise the Dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn All Hallow\u0027s Eve, between dusk and dawn,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood of kin must be drawn,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine drops, no more, no less,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood of kin you must bless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo this the blood of love you add,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the blood of an enemy, it must be had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven drops of each, one by one,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly now, it must be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour drops of a maiden\u0027s blood,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosemary for remembrance,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn infant\u0027s blood, three drops for life anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sprinkling of yarrow, a dash of rue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpread the blood upon the crypt,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the moon commands the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall forth the dead, his name times three,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoubt not, and he will come to thee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver ran down her spine as she read the spell a second time. All Hallow\u0027s Eve. Among witches and warlocks, it was considered the most magical night of the year, a night of power, when the veil that separated this world from the world of spirits was at its thinnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read the poem again. It seemed much too easy and yet, if it was remotely possible, All Hallow\u0027s Eve was the perfect night for such a spell. In ancient times, it was the one night in the year when the dead could return to the land of the living. In Ireland, burial mounds were opened and torches lit so the dead could find their way, though all had to return to their rightful place at sunrise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if her incantation worked, Anthony would not have to return to the Otherworld. She closed her eyes, her mind filling with images of her beloved. Was it truly possible to raise the dead? To see him again! He would surely love her then!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood of kin. Anton, of course. The blood of an enemy. Roshan or his wife, either would do. The blood of a maiden? Roshan\u0027s daughter. An infant\u0027s blood, and rosemary. The blood of love would be her own blood, of course, freely given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugging herself, she imagined how wonderful it would be to see Anthony again, to hear his voice, see his smile. And how wonderful for Anton to finally meet his father!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Hallow\u0027s Eve. She had only a few months to plan and prepare. It seemed too long, and not long enough. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-10.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
