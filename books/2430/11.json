That was weapon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his voice steady. \"It\u0027s an economic weapon. Solaria is important to the other Outer Worlds as a source of advanced models and so it will not be harmed by them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an obvious point,\" said Quemot indifferently. \"That helped us establish our independence. What I have in mind is something else, something more subtle and more cosmic.\" Quemot\u0027s eyes were fixed on his fingers\u0027 ends and his mind was obviously fixed on abstractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Is this another of your sociological theories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuemot\u0027s poorly suppressed look of pride all but forced a short smile out of the Earthman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sociologist said, \"It is indeed mine. Original, as far as I know, and yet obvious if population data on the Outer Worlds is carefully studied. To begin with, ever since the positronic robot was invented, it has been used more and more intensively everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on Earth,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, now, Plainclothesman. I don\u0027t know much of your Earth, but I know enough to know that robots are entering your economy. You people live in large Cities and leave most of your planetary surface unoccupied. Who runs your farms and mines, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robots,\" admitted Baley. \"But if it comes to that, Doctor, Earthmen invented the positronic robot in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did? Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can check. It\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting. Yet robots made the least headway there.\" The sociologist said thoughtfully, \"Perhaps that is because of Earth\u0027s large population. It would take that much longer. Yes... Still, you have robots even in your Cities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More now than, say, fifty years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley nodded impatiently. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it fits. The difference is only one of time. Robots tend to displace human labor. The robot economy moves in only one direction. More robots and fewer humans. I\u0027ve studied population data very carefully and I\u0027ve plotted it and made a few extrapolations.\" He paused in sudden surprise. \"Why, that\u0027s rather an application of mathematics to sociology, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There may be something to it, at that. I will have to give the matter thought. In any case, these are the conclusions I have come to, and I am convinced there is no doubt as to their correctness. The robot-human ratio in any economy that has accepted robot labor tends continuously to increase despite any laws that are passed to prevent it. The increase is slowed, but never stopped. At first the human population increases, but the robot population increases much more quickly. Then, after a certain critical point is reached...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuemot stopped again, then said, \"Now let\u0027s see. I wonder if the critical point could be determined exactly; if you could really put a figure to it. There\u0027s your mathematics again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley stirred restlessly. \"What happens after the critical point is reached, Dr. Quemot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh? Oh, the human population begins actually to decline. A planet approaches a true social stability. Aurora will have to. Even your Earth will have to. Earth may take a few more centuries, but it is inevitable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by social stability?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The situation here. In Solaria. A world in which the humans are the leisure class only. So there is no reason to fear the other Outer Worlds. We need only wait a century perhaps and they shall all be Solarians. I suppose that will be the end of human history, in a way; at least, its fulfillment. Finally, finally, all men will have all they can need and want. You know, there is a phrase I once picked up; I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know where it comes from; something about the pursuit of happiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said thoughtfully, \"All men are \u0027endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights... among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve hit it. Where\u0027s that from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some old document,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see how that is changed here on Solaria and eventually in all the Galaxy? The pursuit will be over. The rights mankind will be heir to will be life, liberty, and happiness. Just that. Happiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said dryly, \"Maybe so, but a man has been killed on your Solaria and another may yet die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt regret almost the moment he spoke, for the expression on Quemot\u0027s face was as though he had been struck with an open palm. The old man\u0027s head bowed. He said without looking up, \"I have answered your questions as well as I could. Is there anything else you wish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have enough. Thank you, sir. I am sorry to have intruded on your grief at your friend\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuemot looked up slowly. \"It will be hard to find another chess partner. He kept our appointments most punctually and he played an extraordinarily even game. He was a good Solarian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" said Baley softly. \"May I have your permission to use your viewer to make contact with the next person I must see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" said Quemot. \"My robots are yours. And now I will leave you. Done viewing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA robot was at Baley\u0027s side within thirty seconds of Quemot\u0027s disappearance and Baley wondered once again how these creatures were managed. He had seen Quemot\u0027s fingers move toward a contact as he had left and that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the signal was quite a generalized one, saying only, \"Do your duty!\" Perhaps robots listened to all that went on and were always aware of what a human might desire at any given moment, and if the particular robot was not designed for a particular job in either mind or body, the radio web that united all robots went into action and the correct robot was spurred into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Baley had the vision of Solaria as a robotic net with holes that were small and continually growing smaller, with every\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman being caught neatly in place. He thought of Quemot\u0027s picture of worlds turning into Solarias; of nets forming and tightening even on Earth, until - His thoughts were disrupted as the robot who had entered spoke\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith the quiet and even respect of the machine. \"I am ready to help you, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Do you know how to reach the place where Rikaine Delmarre once worked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley shrugged. He would never teach himself to avoid asking useless questions. The robots knew. Period. It occurred to him that, to handle robots with true efficiency, one must needs be expert, a sort of roboticist. How well did the average Solarian do, he wondered? Probably only so-so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Get Delmarre\u0027s place and contact his assistant. If the assistant is not there, locate him wherever he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the robot turned to go, Baley called after it, \"Wait! What time is it at the Delmarre work place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About 0630, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Baley felt annoyance at a world that made itself victim of the coming and going of a sun. It was what came of living on bare planetary surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought fugitively of Earth, then tore his mind away. While he kept firmly to the matter in hand, he managed well. Slipping into homesickness would ruin him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Call the assistant, anyway, boy, and tell him it\u0027s government business - and have one of the other boys bring something to eat. A sandwich and a glass of milk will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chewed thoughtfully at the sandwich, which contained a kind of smoked meat, and with half his mind thought that Daneel Olivaw would certainly consider every article of food suspect after what had happened to Gruer. And Daneel might be right, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished the sandwich without ill effects, however (immediate ill effects, at any rate), and sipped at the milk. He had not learned from Quemot what he had come to learn, but he had learned something. As he sorted it out in his mind, it seemed he had learned a good deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle about the murder, to be sure, but more about the larger matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot returned. \"The assistant will accept contact, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Was there any trouble about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The assistant was asleep, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awake now, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assistant was facing him suddenly, sitting up in bed and wearing an expression of sullen resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley reared back as though a force-barrier had been raised before him without warning. Once again a piece of vital information had been withheld from him. Once again he had not asked the right questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had thought to tell him that Rikaine Delmarre\u0027s assistant was a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair was a trifle darker than ordinary Spacer bronze and there was a quantity of it, at the moment in disorder. Her face was oval, her nose a trifle bulbous, and her chin large. She scratched slowly at her side just above the waist and Baley hoped the sheet would remain in position. He remembered Gladia\u0027s free attitude toward what was permitted while viewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt a sardonic amusement at his own disillusion at that moment. Earthmen assumed, somehow, that all Spacer women were beautiful, and certainly Gladia had reinforced that assumption. This one, though, was plain even by Earthly standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt therefore surprised Baley that he found her contralto attractive when she said, \"See here, do you know what time it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" said Baley, \"but since I will be seeing you, I felt I should warn you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seeing me? Skies above - \" Her eyes grew wide and she put a hand to her chin. (She wore a ring on one finger, the first item of personal adornment Baley had yet seen on Solaria.) \"Wait, you\u0027re not my new assistant, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nothing like that. I\u0027m here to investigate the death of Rikaine Delmarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Well, investigate, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiorissa Cantoro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how long have you been working with Dr. Delmarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume you\u0027re now at the place of business.\" (Baley felt uncomfortable at that noncommittal phrase, but he did not know what to call a place where a fetal engineer worked.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you mean, am I at the farm?\" said Kiorissa discontentedly, \"I certainly am. I haven\u0027t left it since the old man was done in, and I won\u0027t leave it, looks like, till an assistant is assigned me. Can you arrange that, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am. I have no influence with anyone here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought I\u0027d ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiorissa pulled off the sheet and climbed out of bed without any self consciousness. She was wearing a one-piece sleeping suit and her hand went to the notch of the seam, where it ended at the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said hurriedly, \"Just one moment. If you\u0027ll agree to see me, that will end my business with you for now and you may dress in privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In privacy?\" She put out her lower lip and stared at Baley curiously. \"You\u0027re finicky, aren\u0027t you? Like the boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you see me? I would like to look over the farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get this business about seeing, but if you want to view the farm I\u0027ll tour you. If you\u0027ll give me a chance to wash and take care of a few things and wake up a little, I\u0027ll enjoy the break in routine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to view anything. I want to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman cocked her head to one side and her keen look had something of professional interest in it. \"Are you a pervert or something? When was the last time you underwent a gene analysis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jehoshaphat!\" muttered Baley. \"Look, I\u0027m Elijah Baley. I\u0027m from Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Earth?\" She cried vehemently. \"Skies above! Whatever are you doing here? Or is this some kind of complicated joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not joking. I was called in to investigate Delmarre\u0027s death. I\u0027m a plainclothesman, a detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean that kind of investigation. But I thought everyone knew his wife did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am, there\u0027s some question about it in my mind. May I have your permission to see the farm and you. As an Earthman, you understand, I\u0027m not accustomed to viewing. It makes me uncomfort\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eable. I have permission from the Head of Security to see people who might help me. I will show you the document, if you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley held the official strip up before her imaged eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Seeing! It\u0027s filthy. Still, skies above, what\u0027s a little more filth in this filthy job? Look here, though, don\u0027t you come close to me. You stay a good distance away. We can shout or send messages by robot, if we have to. You understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sleeping suit split open at the seam just as contact broke off and the last word he heard from her was a muttered: \"Earthman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s close enough,\" said Klorissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley, who was some twenty-five feet from the woman, said, \"It\u0027s all right this distance, but I\u0027d like to get indoors quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had not been so bad this time, somehow. He had scarcely minded the plane trip, but there was no point in overdoing it. He kept himself from yanking at his collar to allow himself to breathe more freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa said sharply, \"What\u0027s wrong with you? You look kind of beat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"I\u0027m not used to the outdoors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right! Earthman! You\u0027ve got to be cooped up or something. Skies above!\" Her tongue passed over her lips as though it tasted something unappetizing. \"Well, come in, then, but let me move out of the way first. All right. Get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair was in two thick braids that wound about her head in a complicated geometrical pattern. Baley wondered how long it took to arrange like that and then remembered that, in all probability, the unerring mechanical fingers of a robot did the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hair set off her oval face and gave it a kind of symmetry that made it pleasant if not pretty. She did not wear any facial makeup, nor, for that matter, were her clothes meant to do more than cover her serviceably. For the most part they were a subdued dark blue except for her gloves, which covered her to mid-arm and were a badly clashing lilac in color. Apparently they were not part of her ordinary costume. Baley noted the thickening of one finger of the gloves owing to the presence of the ring underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey remained at opposite ends of the room, facing one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"You don\u0027t like this, do you, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiorissa shrugged. \"Why should I like it? I\u0027m not an animal. But I can stand it. You get pretty hardened, when you deal with - with\" - she paused, and then her chin went up as though she had made up her mind to say what she had to say without mincing - \"with children.\" She pronounced the word with careful precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound as though you don\u0027t like the job you have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an important job. It must be done. Still, I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Pdkaine Delmarre like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose he didn\u0027t, but he never showed it. He was a good Solarian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he was finicky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa looked surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"You yourself said so. When we were viewing and I said you might dress in private, you said I was finicky like the boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Well, he was finicky. Even viewing he never took any liberties. Always proper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that unusual?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shouldn\u0027t be. Ideally, you\u0027re supposed to be proper, but no one ever is. Not when viewing. There\u0027s no personal presence involved so why take any pains? You know? I don\u0027t take pains when viewing, except with the boss. You had to be formal with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you admire Dr. Delmarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a good Solarian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"You\u0027ve called this place a farm and you\u0027ve mentioned children. Do you bring up children here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the age of a month. Every fetus on Solaria comes here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fetus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She frowned. \"We get them a month after conception. Does this embarrass you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Baley said shortly. \"Can you show me around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can. But keep your distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley\u0027s long face took on a stony grimness as he looked down the length of the long room from above. There was glass between the room and themselves. On the other side, he was sure, was perfectly controlled heat, perfectly controlled humidity, perfectly controlled asepsis. Those tanks, row on row, each contained its little creature floating in a watery fluid of precise composition, infused with a nutrient mixture of ideal proportions. Life and growth went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle things, some smaller than half his fist, curled on themselves, with bulging skulls and tiny budding limbs and vanishing tails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa, from her position twenty feet away, said, \"How do you like it, Plainclothesman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"How many do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As of this morning, one hundred and fifty-two. We receive fifteen to twenty each month and we graduate as many to independence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this the only such institution on the planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. It\u0027s enough to keep the population steady, counting on a life expectancy of three hundred years and a population of twenty thousand. This building is quite new. Dr. Delmarre supervised its construction and made many changes in our procedures. Our fetal death rate now is virtually zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobots threaded their way among the tanks. At each tank they stopped and checked controls in a tireless, meticulous way, looking in at the tiny embryos within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who operates on the mother?\" asked Baley. \"I mean, to get the little things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctors,\" answered Klorissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Delmarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. Medical doctors. You don\u0027t think Dr. Delmarre would ever stoop to - Well, never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t robots be used?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robots in surgery? First Law makes that very difficult, Plainclothesman. A robot might perform an appendectomy to save a human life, if he knew how, but I doubt that he\u0027d be usable after that without major repairs. Cutting human flesh would be quite a traumatic experience for a positronic brain. Human doctors can manage to get hardened to it. Even to the personal presence required.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"I notice that robots tend the fetuses, though. Do you and Dr. Delmarre ever interfere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to, sometimes, when things go wrong. If a fetus has developmental trouble, for instance. Robots can\u0027t be trusted to judge the situation accurately when human life is involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley nodded. \"Too much risk of a misjudgment and a life lost, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Too much risk of overvaluing a life and saving one improperly.\" The woman looked stem. \"As fetal engineers, Baley, we see to it that healthy children are born; healthy ones. Even the best\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egene analysis of parents can\u0027t assure that all gene permutations and combinations will be favorable, to say nothing of the possibility of mutations. That\u0027s our big concern, the unexpected mutation. We\u0027ve got the rate of those down to less than one in a thousand, but that means that, on the average, once a decade, we have trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe motioned him along the balcony and he followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027ll show you the infants\u0027 nurseries and the youngsters\u0027 dormitories. They\u0027re much more a problem than the fetuses are. With them, we can rely on robot labor only to a limited extent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would know, Baley, if you ever tried to teach a robot the importance of discipline. First Law makes them almost impervious to that fact. And don\u0027t think youngsters don\u0027t learn that about as soon as they can talk. I\u0027ve seen a three-year-old holding a dozen robots motionless by yelling, \u0027You\u0027ll hurt me. I\u0027m hurt.\u0027 It takes an extremely advanced robot to understand that a child might be deliberately lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could Delmarre handle the children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he do that? Did he get out among, them and shake sense into them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Delmarre? Touch them? Skies above! Of course not! But he could talk to them. And he could give a robot specific orders. I\u0027ve seen him viewing a child for fifteen minutes, and keeping a robot in spanking position all that time, getting it to spank-spank-spank. A few like that and the child would risk fooling with the boss no more. And the boss was skillful enough about it so that usually the robot didn\u0027t need more than a routine readjustment afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about you? Do you get out among the children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have to sometimes. I\u0027m not like the boss. Maybe someday I\u0027ll be able to handle the long-distance stuff, but right now if I tried, I\u0027d just ruin robots. There\u0027s an art to handling robots really well, you know. When I think of it, though. Getting out among the children. Little animals!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at him suddenly. \"I suppose you wouldn\u0027t mind seeing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t bother me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged and stared at him with amusement. \"Earthman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked on again. \"What\u0027s all this about, anyway? You\u0027ll have to end up with Gladia Delmarre as murderess. You\u0027ll have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not quite sure of that,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you be anything else but sure? Who else could it possibly be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are possibilities, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who, for instance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you, for instance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Klorissa\u0027s reaction to that quite surprised Baley. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-naked-sun-robot-2/page-11.html","bookId":2430,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:06:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:06:46 PM"}
