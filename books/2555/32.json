{"id":111977,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe living room is cold and silent. I slowly prise open my eyes. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone else here. The pile of furniture has been moved and the door is open. Rain is blowing in through the smashed window and the backs of my legs are wet. I try to sit up but the pain is too much and I let myself fall back down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long have I been lying here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to remember what happened. I work my way backwards. I remember Lizzie hitting me. I remember the look of hatred on her face, matched only by the similar expressions on Edward and Josh\u0027s faces. I close my eyes and try to pull myself together. Watching my partner and children run from me and knowing that they have such hate for me hurts more than the physical pain I\u0027m now feeling. I feel empty, betrayed and scared. I can\u0027t explain anything that\u0027s happened. I don\u0027t know why I killed Harry, I just know that I had to do it. I can\u0027t explain why almost my entire family turned against me so quickly and so completely. I can\u0027t explain why Ellis didn\u0027t turn either. Christ, I have to find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself to get up. My body hurts and every movement is difficult. Very slowly, using the arm of the sofa for support, I manage to stand. I catch sight of myself in the mirror that hangs over the gas fire. My right eye is black and swollen. One of my front teeth is loose and I can taste blood at the back of my throat. When I see the state of my face I start to really feel the pain. I drag myself into the kitchen and step over the body on the floor to get myself some water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water is ice-cold and refreshing and it helps clear some of the dullness from my spinning head. I stand over the sink and wash my mouth out, spitting blood into the bowl. I stare into the pinky-red water and try not to look at Harry lying dead at my feet. What the hell happened? The kitchen floor is covered with his dark crimson blood. His lifeless eyes stare up towards the ceiling and I can feel them burning into me. I don\u0027t regret what I did - I had to kill him before he killed me - I just need to understand why...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn off the tap and, apart from the occasional drip of water, the flat is otherwise silent. Could Lizzie have taken the children and hidden upstairs in one of the other apartments? I slowly walk towards the kitchen door, listening carefully. I know in my heart they\u0027ve gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden realisation hits me like a punch to the guts, more painful even than the physical and emotional blows I\u0027ve already taken. Thinking about the flats upstairs has made me remember the body on the landing and the Hater\u0027s words to me when he lay there dying. \u0027Be ready for them,\u0027 he said to me, \u0027it\u0027s them, not us. You see everything clearly when it happens to you.\u0027 Jesus Christ, he looked at me and saw another Hater. I\u0027m one of them. It\u0027s the only logical explanation. How could Harry, Lizzie, Edward and Josh all change at the same time? It stands to reason that I\u0027m the only one who is any different. I can\u0027t explain how or why, but when I looked into their eyes I knew immediately that the others weren\u0027t like me and that they were a threat. I sensed revulsion coming off them. I looked at my family and I feared them and that explains why I did what I did and why so many others have killed before me. I had to attack them before they attacked me. All except Ellis...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep calm I try to tell myself as I run down the hallway and go out into the lobby. I look out through the front door. Damn, my car has gone. Bloody hell, they\u0027ve taken the car and now they could be anywhere. I\u0027m struggling to think straight and my panic-induced nausea has returned. Keep calm, I say to myself again. Think logically. Where would they have gone? Their options are limited. They could have gone to Harry\u0027s house but that\u0027s unlikely with him lying dead on the kitchen floor. Most probably Lizzie will have taken them to her sister\u0027s place. I\u0027ll look for them there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m cold. My clothes are wet and are soiled with both Harry\u0027s blood and my own. I\u0027ll get changed, get some things together and then go and find Ellis. I don\u0027t know where we\u0027ll go once I get her back. We can\u0027t come back here. This place isn\u0027t safe anymore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-32.html","bookId":2555,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM"}
