Her hair was completely flat on one side and splayed out into an improbable sunburst of spikes on the other, making it appear that she was getting hit in the side of the head by a tiny hurricane, which she wasn\u0027t. She was, however, performing the longest sustained yawn Clay had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooo ahe-e, I aya oa a,\" she said in yawnspeak, a language\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not unlike Hawaiian\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;known for its paucity of consonants. (You go ahead, I\u0027m okay, she was saying.) She gestured for Clay to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay cued the tape and fiddled with the audio. A whale tail in a field of blue passed by on the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s someone outside, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have my sandwich with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy stopped yawning and scooted forward on the stool she was perched upon behind Clay. When the whale tail came down, Clay stopped the tape and looked back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Play it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. \"Can we get a feeling for direction?\" Amy asked. \"That housing has stereo microphones, right? What if we move the speakers far apart\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;can we get a sense where it\u0027s coming from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay shook his head. \"The mikes are right next to each other. You have to separate them by at least a meter to get any spatial information. All I can tell you is that it\u0027s in the water and it\u0027s not particularly loud. In fact, if I hadn\u0027t been using the rebreather, I\u0027d never have heard it. You\u0027re the audio person. What can you tell me?\" He ran it back and played it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s human speech.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay looked at her as if to say, Uh-huh, I woke you up because I needed the obvious pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s military.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think it\u0027s military?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Amy gave Clay the same look that he had just finished giving her.\" \u0027Captain\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right,\" said Clay. \"Speaker in the water? Divers with underwater communications? What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t sound like it. Did it sound like it was coming from small speakers to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" Clay played it again. \"Sandwich?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sandwich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Old Broad said that someone called her claiming to be a whale and asked her to tell Nate to bring him a sandwich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy squeezed Clay\u0027s shoulder. \"He\u0027s gone, Clay. I know you don\u0027t believe what I saw happened, but it certainly wasn\u0027t about a sandwich conspiracy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not saying that, Amy. Damn it. I\u0027m not saying this had anything to do with Nate\u0027s\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he was going to say drowning and stopped himself\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"accident. But it might have to do with the lab getting wrecked, the tapes getting stolen, and someone trying to mess with the Old Broad. Someone is fucking with us, Amy, and it might be whoever is recorded on this tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s no way the camera could have pulled a signal out of the air, something on the same frequency or something? A mobile phone or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through a half-inch of powder-coated aluminum housing and a hundred feet of water? No, that signal came in through the mike. That I\u0027m sure of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy nodded and looked at the paused picture on the screen. \"So you\u0027re looking for two things: someone military and someone who has an interest in Nate\u0027s work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" Clay stopped himself again, remembering what he\u0027d said to Nate when the lab had been wrecked. That no one cared about their work. But obviously someone did. \"Tarwater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy shrugged. \"He\u0027s military. Maybe. Leave the tape out. I\u0027ll run a spectrograph on the audio in the morning, see if I can tell if it\u0027s coming through some kind of amplifier. I\u0027ve got nothing left tonight\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027m beat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Clay said. \"You get some rest, kiddo. I\u0027m going to hit it, too. I\u0027ll be heading down to the harbor first thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Kay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, and hey, the \u0027kiddo\u0027 thing, I didn\u0027t mean\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy threw her arms around him and kissed the top of his head. \"You big mook. Don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ll get through this.\" She turned and started out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused in the doorway. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I ask you a... personal question, kinda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shirt\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who\u0027s stupid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her shirt, then back at him and grinned. \"Always seems to apply, Clay. No matter where I am or who I\u0027m with, the smoke clears and the shirt is true. You gotta hang on to truth when you find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like truth,\" Clay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Night, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Night, kiddo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day the weather was blown out, with whitecaps frosting the entire channel across to Lanai and the coconut palms whipping overhead like epileptic dust mops. Clay drove by the harbor in his truck, noting that the cabin cruiser that Cliff Hyland\u0027s group had been using was parked in its slip. Then he turned around and caught a flash of white out of the corner of his eye as he drove past the hundred-year-old Pioneer Inn\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Captain Tarwater\u0027s navy whites standing out against the green shiplap. He parked his truck by the giant banyan tree next door and humped it over to the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Clay came up to the table, the hostess was just seating Cliff Hyland, Tarwater, and one of their grad students, a young blond woman with a raccoon sunburn and straw-dry hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Cliff,\" Clay said. \"You got a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clay, how you doing?\" Hyland took off his sunglasses and stood to shake hands. \"Please, join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay looked at Tarwater, and the naval officer nodded. \"Sorry to hear about your partner,\" he said. Then he looked back down at his menu. The young woman sitting with them was watching the dynamic between the three men as if she might write a paper on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a second,\" Clay said. \"If I could talk to you outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Tarwater glanced up and gave Cliff Hyland an almost imperceptible shake of the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Clay,\" Cliff said, \"let\u0027s walk.\" He looked to the junior researcher. \"When she comes, coffee, Portuguese sausage, eggs over easy, whole wheat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl nodded. Hyland followed Clay out to the front of the hotel, which overlooked the harbor fueling station and the Carthaginian, a steel-hulled replica of a whaling brig, now used as a floating museum. They stood side by side, watching the harbor, each with a foot propped on the seawall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up, Clay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you guys working on, Cliff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I can\u0027t talk about that. I signed a nondisclosure thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got divers in the water, people with underwater coms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly, Clay. You\u0027ve seen my crew. Except for Tarwater, they\u0027re just kids. What\u0027s this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody\u0027s fucking with us, Cliff. They sank my boat, tore up the office, took Nate\u0027s papers and tapes. They\u0027re even messing with one of our benefactors. I\u0027m not even sure they don\u0027t have something to do with Nate\u0027s\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think it\u0027s me?\" Hyland took his foot off the seawall and turned to Clay. \"Nate was my friend, too. I\u0027ve known you guys, what? Twenty-two, twenty-three years? You can\u0027t think I\u0027d do anything like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not saying you personally. What are you and Tarwater working on, Cliff? What would Nate know that would interfere with what you\u0027re doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyland stared at his feet. Scratched his beard. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know? You know what we\u0027re doing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;figure it out. Listen, I know you guys are using a big towable sonar rig, right? What\u0027s Tarwater looking at? Some new kind of active sonar? If it didn\u0027t have a hinky element, he wouldn\u0027t be here on site. Mines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Clay, I can\u0027t tell you! I can tell you that if I thought it was going to hurt the animals, or anyone in the field for that matter, I wouldn\u0027t be doing the work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember the navy\u0027s Pacific Biological Ocean Science Program? Were you in on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Birds, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, seabirds. The navy came to a bunch of field biologists with a ton of money\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;wanted seabirds tagged and tracked, behavior recorded, population information, habitat, everything. Everyone thought the heavens had opened up and started raining money. Thought the navy was doing some sort of secret impact study to preserve the birds. Do you know what the study was actually for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that was before my time, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wanted to use the birds as delivery systems for biological weapons. Wanted to make sure they could predict that they\u0027d fly to the enemy. Probably fifty scientists helped in that study.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it didn\u0027t happen, Clay, did it? I mean, the data was valuable scientifically, but the weapons project didn\u0027t pan out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as we know. That\u0027s the point. How would we know, until a seagull drops fucking anthrax on us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Hyland had aged a couple of years in the few minutes they\u0027d been standing there. \"I promise, Clay, if there\u0027s any indication that Tarwater or the navy or any of the spooky guys that come around from time to time are involved with trying to sabotage you guys, I\u0027ll call you in an instant. I promise you. But I can\u0027t tell you what I\u0027m working on, or why. I don\u0027t exactly have funding coming out my ears. If I lose this, I\u0027m teaching freshmen about dolphin jaws. I\u0027m not ready for that. I need to be in the field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay looked at him sideways and saw that there was real concern, maybe even a spark of desperation in Hyland\u0027s eyes. \"You know, your funding might be a little easier to come by if you weren\u0027t based in Iowa. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve noticed, but there\u0027s no ocean in Iowa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyland smiled at the old dig. \"Thanks for pointing that out, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay extended his hand. \"You promise you\u0027ll let me know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay left feeling totally spent. The great head of steam he\u0027d built up through a night of fitful sleep had wilted into exhaustion and confusion. He got in his truck and sat while sweat rolled down his neck. He watched tourists in aloha wear mill around under the great banyan tree like gift-wrapped zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Hyland\u0027s eggs were still steaming when he returned to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarwater looked up from his own breakfast and moved his snow-white hat away from Hyland\u0027s plate, as if the rumpled scientist might splash yolk over the gold anchors in a fit of disorganized eating. \"Everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman at the table fidgeted and tried to look invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clay\u0027s still a little shaken up. Understandably. He and Nathan Quinn have been working together a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky they made it this long without self-destructing,\" Tarwater said. \"Slipshod as they run that operation. You see that kid that works for them? Not worth grinding up for chum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Hyland dropped his fork in his plate. \"Nathan Quinn was one of the most intuitively brilliant biologists in the field. And Clay Demodocus may very well be the best underwater photographer in the world, certainly when it comes to cetaceans. You have no right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The world turns, Doc. Yesterday\u0027s alphas are today\u0027s betas. Losers lose. Isn\u0027t that what you biologists teach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Hyland came very close to burying a fork in Tarwater\u0027s tanned forehead, but instead he slowly climbed to his feet. \"I need to use the restroom. Excuse me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked away, Hyland could hear Tarwater lecturing the junior researcher on how the strong survive. Cliff dug his mobile phone out of the pocket of his safari shirt and began scrolling through the numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay was just dozing off in the driver\u0027s seat when his mobile trilled. Without looking at the display, he figured it was Clair checking up on him. \"Go, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clay, it\u0027s Cliff Hyland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cliff? What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to keep this under your hat, Clay. It\u0027s my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got you. What is it, Cliff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a torpedo range. We\u0027re doing site studies for a torpedo test range.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the sanctuary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right in the middle of the sanctuary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeepers, Cliff, that\u0027s terrible. I don\u0027t know if my hat is big enough to hold that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave me your word, Clay. What\u0027s with \u0027jeepers\u0027? Who says \u0027jeepers\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy does. She\u0027s a little eccentric. Tell me more. Does the navy have divers in the water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeinous Fuckery Most Foul\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeepers,\" said Amy. She was at Quinn\u0027s computer. Streamers of digital videotape were festooned across her lap and over the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s heinous fuckery most foul,\" said Kona. He was perched on the high stool behind Amy and actually appeared to be trying to learn something when Clay came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been simulating explosions on the lee of Kahoolawe with a big towable array of underwater speakers, measuring the levels. The speaker array is what\u0027s in that big case we\u0027ve seen on their boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a couple of explosions on the singer tapes, but distant,\" Amy said. \"Nate thought it might be naval exercises out at sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of tapes?\" Clay picked up a strand of tape. \"This isn\u0027t my rebreather footage, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Clay. I didn\u0027t get the video, but I pulled the audio off before this happened. Want to see the spectrograph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKona asked, \"You think those voices in the water be navy divers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay looked at Amy, raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cliff says there\u0027re no divers in the water, that his operation is it, militarily, in the sanctuary anyway. But he might not even know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy wadded up the videotape and chucked the resulting bird\u0027s nest into the wastebasket. \"How can they do that, Clay? How can they put a torpedo range in the middle of the humpback sanctuary? It\u0027s not like people won\u0027t notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she\u0027s a big ocean. Why here?\" Kona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea. Maybe they don\u0027t want there to be any mistake about whose waters they\u0027re blowing up ordnance in. If they blow them up in between a bunch of American islands, maybe there can\u0027t be any misinterpretation about what they\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lost now,\" Kona said. \"Does not compute. Danger. Danger. Control room needs herb.\" The Rastafarian had affected an accent that seemed an excellent approximation of how a stoned robot might sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Submarine warfare is all about hide and seek with other submarines,\" Clay said. \"The crews are autonomous when they\u0027re underwater. They make decisions on whether they\u0027re being attacked and whether to defend. Maybe if the navy just shot torpedoes off in the middle of the open sea, someone might misinterpret the action as an attack. It\u0027s damn unlikely that a Russian sub is going to be cruising up to Wailea for brunch and misinterpret an attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t do that,\" Amy said. \"They can\u0027t let them set off high explosives around the mothers and calves. It\u0027s just insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll go deep and say it doesn\u0027t bother them. The navy will guarantee they won\u0027t blow up anything shallower than, say, four hundred feet. The humpbacks don\u0027t dive that deep in this channel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes they do,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No they don\u0027t,\" Clay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no data on that, Amy. That\u0027s specifically what Cliff Hyland asked me about. He wanted to know if we were doing any research on the depth of humpback dives. Said that it would be the only thing the navy would care about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy stood up and shoved the wheeled desk chair away. It bounced off Kona\u0027s shins, causing him to wince. \"Ease on up, sistah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, this wasn\u0027t my idea,\" Clay said. \"I\u0027m just telling you what Hyland told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Amy said. She pushed her way past Clay and headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere else.\" She let the screen door slam behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay turned to Kona, who appeared to be studying the ceiling with great concentration. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You makin\u0027 up that submarine war story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of. I read a Tom Clancy book once. Look, Kona, I\u0027m not supposed to know stuff. Nate knew stuff. I just take the pictures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think the navy sink your boat? Maybe make something bad happen to Nate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boat, maybe. I don\u0027t think they could have had anything to do with Nate. That was just bad luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Snowy Biscuit\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;all this getting under her skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go put the calm on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Clay said. He walked to the other side of the office, slumped in his chair, and pulled his editing tools up on the giant monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later he heard a tiny voice coming through the screen door. \"Sorry,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped into the room and stood there, not looking as glazed as he would have expected if Kona had put the calm on her in an herbal way. \"Sorry about your tape, too. The camera was making crunching noises on playback, so I sort of rushed taking it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a problem. It was your big rescue scene. It just made me look like an amateur. I got most of it on the hard drive, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" She stepped over to the monitor. \"That it?\" Frame stopped, the whale tail from the edge, black marks barely visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just going through it to see if there\u0027s anything else the audio picked up. The camera was running the whole time you were saving my bacon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you let it rest and let me take you out to lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ten-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, you\u0027re Mr. Rigid Schedule all of a sudden? Come out to lunch with me. I feel bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t feel bad, Amy. It\u0027s a huge loss. I... I\u0027m not dealing well myself. You know, to keep this work going, we\u0027ll be needing some academic juice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy just stared at the frozen image of the whale tail, and then she caught herself. \"What? Oh, you\u0027ll get someone. You put the word out, you\u0027ll have Ph.D.\u0027s knocking the door down to work with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? I\u0027m crap. I don\u0027t even have a bona fide hair color. Ink on my master\u0027s isn\u0027t even dry. You read my resume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seemed intelligent. You were willing to work for nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nate read it, though, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him you were good. And if it\u0027s any consolation, he thought the world of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how you hire? I\u0027m smart and I\u0027m cheap\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s it? What kind of standards do you guys have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you met Kona?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at the monitor, then at Clay again. \"I feel so used. Honored, but used. Look, I\u0027m thrilled you want to keep me on, but I\u0027m not going to bring you funding or legitimacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll worry about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worry about it after lunch. Come on, I\u0027ll buy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re poor. Besides, I\u0027m meeting Clair for lunch at one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Can I borrow Nate\u0027s\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;uh, the green truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keys are on the counter.\" Clay waved over his shoulder toward the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy took the keys, then started out the door, caught herself, then ran back, and threw her arms around the photographer. \"I really appreciate your asking me to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go. Take Kona with you. Feed him. Hose him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, if you\u0027re not coming, I\u0027m going solo. Tell Clair hi for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at the computer, looked past the window at the brilliant Maui sun, then shut the computer down, feeling very much as if nothing he did mattered or would ever matter again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings/page-9.html","bookId":2050,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM"}
