After which, she glanced at Ying Huanhuan, who was now being embraced by Lin Dong.

They were just about to speak when their pretty eyes hardened. Meanwhile, Lin Dong’s expression also changed at the same time. He slowly turned his head before he cast his attention towards a distant mountain top. There was a black figure standing at that spot like a statue, with his hands behind his back. He gave off no aura and it was completely impossible to detect him. However, his body did exist at that spot. Hence, this strange sensation caused the expressions of Lin Dong’s group to turn grave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, a trap that was set up over so many years was actually destroyed in this manner… What a waste.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe black figure looked at Lin Dong’s group.
