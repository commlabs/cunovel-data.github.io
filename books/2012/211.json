I spoke out of concern, and in return you do nothing but insult me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know the reasons behind your words, Fist Blistig,’ Hanavat said levelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met her eyes unflinching, and then, shrugging, he said, ‘The slut speaks.’ He turned and left them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Fist walked away, Shelemasa drew a shaky breath and stepped close to Hanavat. ‘Mother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. ‘I am fine, Shelemasa. The fever thirst is on Fist Blistig. That and nothing more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He said we were done . I will not be pitied! Not by anyone! The Khundryl—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct believes we are still of worth, and so do I. Now, let us tend to our beasts. Do we have enough fodder?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa shook herself, and then nodded. ‘More than we need, in fact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. And our water?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanavat sighed, and then arched her back with a groan. ‘I’m too old to think of her as my mother,’ she said, ‘and yet I do. We still breathe, Shelemasa. And we can still walk. For now, that must be enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa stepped closer, as close as she dared to get. ‘You have borne children. You have loved a man—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Many men, truth be told.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought that, one day, I could say the same for myself. I thought I could look back and be satisfied.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You don’t deserve to die, Shelemasa. I could not agree with you more, and so you shall not. We will do whatever must be done. We will live through this—’ She cut herself off then and Shelemasa looked up to see her staring back at the Khundryl camp. She followed the older woman’s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGall had appeared, and at his side stood Jastara, his eldest son’s widow. Shelemasa moved to block Hanavat from their view, and then walked over. ‘Warleader,’ she hissed, ‘how many times will you wound her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior seemed to have aged a dozen years since she had last seen him, but it did nothing to cool her fury. And in his unwillingness to meet her eyes she saw only cowardice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We go to our sons this night,’ he said. ‘Tell her that. I do not mean to wound. Tonight, or the next. Soon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Soon,’ said Jastara, her tone harsh. ‘And I will see my husband again. I will walk at his side—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa felt disgust twisting her face. ‘After sleeping with his father? Will you, Jastara? Is his spirit here? Does he see you? Does he know all that you have done? Yet you tell yourself you will be at his side again – you are mad!’ A hand settled on her shoulder and she turned. ‘Hanavat – no—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are so quick to defend me, Shelemasa, and for that I am ever grateful. But I will speak to my husband.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJastara had backed away at Shelemasa’s words, and a moment later she fled, pushing through the crowd that had gathered. A few of the older women spun to strike at her when she rushed past. A dozen youths gathered nearby laughed and one reached down for a stone—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Belay that, scout!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bark, the girl froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Fiddler was walking into the Khundryl camp, to collect his scouts. He glanced over at Gall, Hanavat and Shelemasa and for an instant it seemed he was simply going to continue on to his charges, but then he altered his path and approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No disrespect intended, Mother Hanavat, but we don’t have time for all this shit. Your histories are just that – a heap of stories you keep dragging everywhere you go. Warleader Gall, all that doom you’re bleating on about is a waste of breath. We’re not blind. None of us. The only question you have to deal with now is how are you going to face that end? Like a warrior, or on your Hood-damned knees?’ Then, ignoring the crowd, Fiddler made his way towards his troop. ‘We’re on point this night, scouts. Take up those spears and let’s get moving. The column’s about to march.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa watched the Malazan lead the youths away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Hanavat, a low laugh, and then, ‘No disrespect, he said. And then he went and slapped us all down.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mother—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, he was right, Shelemasa. We stand here, naked but for our pride. Yet see how heavy it weighs. Well, this night, I think, I will try to step lighter – after all, what have I left to lose?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour child .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if Hanavat had read her mind, she reached up and brushed Shelemasa’s cheek. ‘I will die first,’ she whispered, ‘and the one within me shall quickly follow. If this is how it must be, then I must accept it. As must we all.’ She faced her husband then. ‘But not on our knees. We are Khundryl. We are the Burned Tears.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-211.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
