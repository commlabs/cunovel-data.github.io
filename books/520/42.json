Of course I know that you\u0027re my guardian,\n\u003cbr\u003e and that I have to regard your wishes in all matters, but I couldn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e see any REASON. It was so distinctly the best thing that could\n\u003cbr\u003e have happened to me. If I had been Daddy, and you had been Judy,\n\u003cbr\u003e I should have said, `Bless yo my child, run along and have a\n\u003cbr\u003e good time; see lots of new people and learn lots of new things;\n\u003cbr\u003e live out of doors, and get strong and well and rested for a year\n\u003cbr\u003e of hard work.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But not at all! Just a curt line from your secretary ordering me\n\u003cbr\u003e to Lock Willow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the impersonality of your commands that hurts my feelings. \n\u003cbr\u003e It seems as though, if you felt the tiniest little bit for me the\n\u003cbr\u003e way I feel for you, you\u0027d sometimes send me a message that you\u0027d\n\u003cbr\u003e written with your own hand, instead of those beastly typewritten\n\u003cbr\u003e secretary\u0027s notes. If there were the slightest hint that you cared,\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027d do anything on earth to please you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I know that I was to write nice, long, detailed letters without ever\n\u003cbr\u003e expecting any answer. You\u0027re living up to your side of the bargain--\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m being educated--and I suppose you\u0027re thinking I\u0027m not living up\n\u003cbr\u003e to mine!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But, Daddy, it is a hard bargain. It is, really. I\u0027m so awfully lonely. \n\u003cbr\u003e You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so shadowy. \n\u003cbr\u003e You\u0027re just an imaginary man that I\u0027ve made up--and probably\n\u003cbr\u003e the real YOU isn\u0027t a bit like my imaginary YOU. But you did once,\n\u003cbr\u003e when I was ill in the infirmary, send me a message, and now,\n\u003cbr\u003e when I am feeling awfully forgotten, I get out your card and read\n\u003cbr\u003e it over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t think I am telling you at all what I started to say,\n\u003cbr\u003e which was this:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Although my feelings are still hurt, for it is very humiliating\n\u003cbr\u003e to be picked up and moved about by an arbitrary, peremptory,\n\u003cbr\u003e unreasonable, omnipotent, invisible Providence, still, when a man\n\u003cbr\u003e has been as kind and generous and thoughtful as you have heretofore\n\u003cbr\u003e been towards me, I suppose he has a right to be an arbitrary,\n\u003cbr\u003e peremptory, unreasonable, invisible Providence if he chooses, and so--\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll forgive you and be cheerful again. But I still don\u0027t enjoy\n\u003cbr\u003e getting Sallie\u0027s letters about the good times they are having in camp!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However--we will draw a veil over that and begin again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been writing and writing this summer; four short stories\n\u003cbr\u003e finished and sent to four different magazines. So you see I\u0027m\n\u003cbr\u003e trying to be an author. I have a workroom fixed in a corner of the\n\u003cbr\u003e attic where Master Jervie used to have his rainy-day playroom. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s in a cool, breezy corner with two dormer windows, and shaded\n\u003cbr\u003e by a maple tree with a family of red squirrels living in a hole.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll write a nicer letter in a few days and tell you all the farm news.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We need rain.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours as ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59764.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
