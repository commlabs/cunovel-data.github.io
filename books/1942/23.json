But I’m sick of this, Rosie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it with you?” she demanded, whirling around. “We can’t talk anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I said was that I don’t remember you telling me you’d be gone all day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I said—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you said.” He was fast losing his temper. “You might’ve reminded me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, so I could listen to you complain about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, so that was it. She saw him as complaining. The finger had been pointed and it was aimed in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m making up a to-do list for you,” he snapped, grabbing a pen and paper. “First, we need groceries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were at the store. You might’ve picked up more than milk and bread, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I work forty hours a week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I don’t?” she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look around you and answer that question for yourself. If you are employed, exactly who are you working for? Not your family. Not me. Not our children. A Christmas Bazaar is more important than a Saturday with your family. A bake sale at the mall outweighs decorating a Christmas tree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie slammed a pound of frozen hamburger into the microwave. “Don’t paint yourself as a martyr in this marriage, Zachary Cox. If you think you’re so perfect, then you can start doing more to help around here. Who said it was my responsibility to buy the groceries? You seem to think that because I don’t have a nine-to-five job, you can rule my days. I have a life, too, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t yell!” Eddie screamed. “Don’t yell anymore!” He stood in the kitchen entrance, tears in his eyes, his hands covering his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eddie, I’m so sorry,” Rosie cried, sounding close to weeping herself. She bent down to hug their son and cast an accusing glare at Zach. “Now look what you’ve done!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” Funny how everything got turned around so that he was the one at fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach waited until after dinner—a pot of chili thrown together in about twenty minutes, but still an improvement over recent meals—before approaching his wife again. “It’s clear we have several issues that need to be addressed,” he began as she watched a rerun of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Several issues,” she repeated. “You sound like an attorney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, I sound like an attorney. Let’s just get through the holidays. The kids are hurting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So am I, Zach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not exactly overwhelmed with happiness myself.” He walked out of the family room and into the bedroom. A second television was set up there. He put on the History Channel and tried to watch a documentary about Napoleon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie came in an hour later. “Do you want to talk this out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced in her direction and frankly couldn’t see the point of any discussion. “Not particularly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say anything for a moment. “That’s what I thought. Just remember I tried, Zach. I sincerely tried. But you’re impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was trying so hard, then she’d be with her family where she belonged, Zach thought and steeled himself against giving in. Rosie was the transgressor here, and he wasn’t going to drop this until she owned up to her faults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace hadn’t been sleeping well since Thanksgiving Day. The more she dwelled on the phone calls, the more she came to believe it’d been Dan on the other end of the line. For some sick reason, her ex-husband felt it was necessary to destroy what little peace she’d found in the months since his disappearance. It had occurred to her that he might even have someone feeding him information about the details of her life. That would explain the timing of the calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the last three weeks, she’d consistently awakened about four in the morning, when the night was its darkest. She was unable to return to sleep and lay there overwhelmed by guilt and fear and pain. She felt anger, too, as she imagined where he was and who he was with—imagined them laughing at her. It had been like this in the beginning, but gradually she’d come to terms with the shock of Dan’s actions. Now, following the phone calls, it was bad again, as bad as it had been those first few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Grace arrived at the library on Monday morning, her eyes burned from lack of sleep and her spirits were in the doldrums. The only positive feeling she had about the holidays had to do with her grandson. Little Tyler was almost four months old now, and the very light of her life. The problems of the world faded away when she held her grandbaby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Harding entered the library just before noon. Grace sensed his presence even before she saw him. He returned a book and then casually strolled toward her desk. He wore a lazy smile that touched her with its warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace’s mouth went dry, and despite herself, she felt flustered. She knew he’d gone to see his daughter on the East Coast, but she hadn’t heard from him since, and for that she was grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I asked you to lunch, would you come?” he whispered, leaning against her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could answer, he added, “Charlotte told me your divorce was final Thanksgiving week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was.” She swallowed hard, unsure how to tell him what was in her heart. She wasn’t ready to get involved in another relationship. And she didn’t know when she would be. The divorce might be final but the questions, the doubts and fears, continued to haunt her. Legally she was free, but emotionally she clung to the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lunch?” he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so…. I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about a walk along the waterfront? The sun’s out and a leisurely stroll would do us both good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace agreed; it seemed like a reasonable compromise. “Let me check with Loretta first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer assistant was more than willing to switch lunch hours. Grace gathered her coat and gloves and met him in front of the library. Cliff was studying the mural when she joined him. The painting was a favorite of hers; the artist had depicted a late 1800s waterfront scene with a family picnicking in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How was your visit with Lisa?” she asked. From previous conversations, Grace had learned that his daughter was twenty-eight and married to a financial advisor in Maryland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful. She asked me if I was dating yet.” He looked meaningfully in her direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you tell her?” Grace asked. She buried her hands in the pockets of her long wool coat and matched her pace to his as they walked toward the gazebo and picnic area. The grandstand was where the Concerts on the Cove were staged each Thursday night during the summer. Now, in mid-December, the whole park was bleak and empty. Their only company was a bevy of seagulls who circled above looking for a handout. Their piercing, discordant cries echoed across the waterfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told Lisa not yet, but I’d picked out the girl.” Again he studied Grace. “I’m just waiting for the girl to notice me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice him? Grace nearly laughed out loud. She’d noticed Cliff, all right. But she stood frozen with one foot in her old life and the other unwillingly thrust into a new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to keep me waiting long, Grace Sherman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished she had an answer for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say anything,” Cliff said. “I promised myself I wasn’t going to press you.” He exhaled, and his breath created a fog in the cold, crisp air. “You asked about my visit with Lisa and I can tell you it was definitely an experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The day after I arrived, a blizzard hit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard about that on the news,” Grace said, remembering the report of the snowstorm that had struck the East Coast Thanksgiving Week. “Did you lose your electricity?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right in the middle of cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Naturally, the turkey was only partially done. I suggested we serve sushi turkey but no one seemed interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What any enterprising soul would. The turkey got barbecued in the middle of a snowstorm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace laughed, picturing Cliff huddled over a barbecue with wind and snow whirling all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about your Thanksgiving?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was quiet with just me and Maryellen.” She gnawed on her lower lip, wondering if she should mention Dan’s phone calls. In the end, she didn’t. Then, feeling guilty and uneasy about what she had to say to him, she sank onto the edge of a picnic bench. “Listen, Cliff, maybe this isn’t such a good idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Us taking a walk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…Your daughter’s anxious for you to get out into the dating world again and you appear to be ready. I want you to start, but I don’t think it’s right for me just yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned as if she’d completely missed the point. “What you apparently don’t understand, Grace, is that the only woman I’m interested in dating is you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace shook her head. “Come on, Cliff—I don’t believe that. Ask Charlotte to recommend someone. She knows just about everyone in town and once you’ve met a few other women, you can decide if you still feel the same way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis frown was back in place. “You’re not the jealous type, I take it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year earlier her response would have been automatic. There wasn’t a jealous bone in her body, she would’ve said. She couldn’t say that any longer. Until a few months ago, she hadn’t viewed herself as possessive. Then she’d learned that Dan had been seen with another woman. Afterward she’d been filled with such rage that she’d torn the bedroom apart and dumped his entire half of the closet outside. Dan’s clothes had been strewn across the front porch and the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know about that,” she told him. “I think most people are capable of jealousy. Anyway, I want you to promise me you’ll at least consider meeting other women. It’ll be good for you, Cliff.” Good for her, too, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to the middle of the large gazebo, stood there a moment, then purposefully strolled back. “Okay. I considered it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace laughed, shaking her head. “You’re not taking me seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, but I am.” Cliff sat down on the bench beside her. “I don’t want to see any other woman, Grace. I’ll wait for you. Like I told you before, I’m a patient man. Don’t worry, I’m not going to pressure you, but I might give you a gentle reminder every now and then.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/204-rosewood-lane-cedar-cove-2/page-23.html","bookId":1942,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:25 AM"}
