Baaljagg was slowly coming forward, closer to where Setoc stood, its massive head lowered. Amby Bole remained close to his brother’s barrow, closed in and silent, his once young face now old, and whatever love there had been in his eyes had vanished. Cartographer stood with one foot in the coals of the hearth, staring at something to the east – perhaps the rising sun – while Sweetest Sufferance was helping Faint to her feet. I need to try some more healing on her. I can show Amby I don’t always fail. I can – no, think about what is before us now! She gave Mappo what he wants, as easy as that. She bargains quick, she speaks true . Precious faced the Bonecaster. ‘Ancient One, we in the Trygalle are stranded here. I have not the power to take us home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will not interfere if I bless you with what you need?’ Olar Ethil nodded. ‘Agreed. Collect the child.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t even think it,’ Gruntle warned, the look in his unhuman eyes halting Precious in her tracks. The barbs on his bared arms seemed to blur a moment, then grew sharp once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bonecaster said, ‘The boy is mine, whelp, because his father belongs to me. The First Sword serves me once again. Would you truly desire to prevent me from reuniting the son with the father?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavi and Storii rushed closer, their questions tumbling together. ‘Father – he’s alive? Where is he?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle barred their way with a levelled cutlass. ‘Hold a moment, you two. Something is not right here. Wait, I beg you. Guard your brother.’ He turned back to Olar Ethil. ‘If the boy’s father now serves you, where is he?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not far.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then bring him to us,’ Gruntle said. ‘He can collect his children himself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The daughters are not of his blood,’ Olar Ethil replied. ‘I have no use for them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You? What of Onos Toolan?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Give them to me, then, and I will see to their disposal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent spun round. ‘Slitting their throats is what she means, Gruntle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did not say that, warrior,’ the Bonecaster retorted. ‘I will take the three, this I offer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaaljagg was edging closer to Olar Ethil, and she beckoned to it. ‘Blessed Ay, I greet you and invite you into my comp—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge beast lunged, massive jaws crunching as they closed round the Bonecaster’s right shoulder. The ay then spun, whipping Olar Ethil from her feet. Strips of reptile hide, fetishes of bone and shell flailed and snapped. The giant wolf did not release its grip, instead reared a second time, slamming Olar Ethil hard on to the ground. Bones splintered in its jaws, and the body struggled feebly, as would a victim stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaaljagg tore loose its grip on her crushed shoulder and closed its fangs about her skull. It then whipped her into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlar Ethil’s left hand was suddenly stabbing into the ay’s throat, punching through withered hide and closing on its spinal column. Even as the wolf flung her upward, she caught hold. The momentum from Baaljagg’s surge added force to her grip. A sudden, terrible ripping sound erupted from the ay, and like a serpent a length of the beast’s spinal column tore free of its throat, still clutched in the witch’s bony hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bonecaster spun away from the ay, landing hard in a clatter of bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaaljagg collapsed, head lolling like a stone in a sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsi wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Olar Ethil was picking herself up, Gruntle marched towards her, his two weapons readied. Seeing him, she flung the spinal column to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd began to veer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached her, she was nothing but a blur, moments from expanding into something huge. He punched where her head had been a moment earlier, and the bell hilt of the cutlass cracked hard against something. The veering abruptly vanished. Reeling back, her face crushed, Olar Ethil sprawled on her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Spit on the tiger god ,’ Gruntle said, standing directly over her. ‘Hood take your stupid veering, and mine!’ Clashing his blades together, he brought them down in an X pattern beneath her jaw. ‘Now, Bonecaster, I happen to know that if you hit even T’lan Imass bones hard enough, they shatter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No mortal—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Piss on that. I will leave you in pieces, do you understand me? Pieces. How’s it done again? Head in a niche? On a pole? The crook of a tree? No trees here, witch, but a hole in the ground, that’s easy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The child is mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He won’t have you.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-23.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
