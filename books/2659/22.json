Then he held his hand out to her. “It’s not far. If you don’t like it, we can come right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing she probably shouldn’t go, Amelia went anyway, enjoying the rush of excitement she felt at doing something so completely out of the ordinary, something new and different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is your name?” she asked, as he helped her over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benedict. But everyone call s me Benny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Benny.” She smiled shyly. “I’m Amelia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her, then tipped his hat in a grand bow before col ecting his pole from where he’d set it aside to assist her. They walked without speaking for a few moments, moving through the thick grouping of trees until the sound of rushing water could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it that you came to work for Lord Welton?” she queried, studying him with a sidelong glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “I heard there was work to be had and I showed my face at the spot I was told to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of living is this?” she wondered. “What skil s will you gain? What will you do when you are no longer needed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, his eyes sparkling from within the shadow cast by the brim of his hat. “I’m earning my way down to London, you see. By the time I make it, I’l have experience. Then I plan to work for St. John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that? What does he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny stumbled to a halt, gaping at her. He blinked and then whistled low. “Yer green as grass,” he murmured, shaking his head, then he continued on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean?” she griped, stumbling after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey emerged from the coppice and approached a small but rapidly moving stream. The bed was rocky and the water shal ow, a lovely place that carried the feeling of innocence, as if the area was rarely breached by anyone. Amelia plopped onto a fall en log and began to untie her boots, impatiently pushing her waist-length hair back over her shoulder. Benny moved to the shore and shrugged out of his coat. While he settled himself comfortably, she shucked her stockings. Then, lifting her skirts, she moved to the water and stepped careful y into it. Her breath caught as the water chil ed her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yer scaring off all the fish!” Benny complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, this is wonderful!” she cried, fil ed with memories of hunting tadpoles and sloshing through mud with Colin. “Thank you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny frowned at her. “For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For bringing me here. For talking to me.” Laughing, she spun about, then cried out in surprise as she slipped on a smooth river rock and tumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGal ant Benny leapt to his feet and tried to catch her, only to land flat on his back, half in and out of the water, with her atop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to help it, Amelia laughed out loud, and once she started, she couldn’t seem to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sire always said the Quality was daft,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was in the process of pushing herself up when scuffed boots came into view and she was ignobly hauled up by the scruff of her flowered gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What in bloody hel are you doing?” Colin growled, glaring down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laughter choked into silence, her eyes wide at the vision before her. Colin was dark haired, dark skinned, and dark eyed with a big-boned build that made her mouth dry. Gypsy blood, her last governess had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen had he grown so tal ? He towered over her, his hair fall ing over his brow as he stared down at her so intensely she squirmed. There was nothing boyish about him, not with that chiseled jaw and knowing eyes. What had happened to the friend she had once loved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, she realized he was gone forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head fel forward in an effort to hide her grief over the loss. “I was enjoying myself,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long moment passed when she could feel his gaze boring into the crown of her head. Then a low, agitated sound rumbled in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay away from her,” he bit out to Benny, who had pushed up to a seated position at their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin grabbed her elbow and pulled her away, catching up her boots and stockings as he passed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it.” Amelia struggled, her feet crunching on dead leaves. Without missing a beat, he tossed her over his shoulder and strode into the trees like a conquering warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put me down!” she cried, mortified, the cascade of her hair pouring over her face to nearly drag along the forest floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he ignored her, carrying her into a tiny clearing before he set her down and dropped her belongings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swal owed hard and lifted her chin. “I am not a child! I can make my own decisions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze narrowed and he crossed his arms, revealing the powerful muscles he built with hard labor. Dressed in breeches and sweater, he looked rough and ready for anything. His appearance intensified the strange feelings she’d begun having for him, flutters that started in her lower bel y and radiated outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suggest one of those decisions involve wearing your hair up,” he said coldly. “You are too old to wear it down any longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will do what I please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle in his jaw ticked. “Not when what pleases you is cavorting with the likes of him.” He gestured behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a harsh, derisive little laugh. “Who do you think you are to order me about? You are a servant. My father is a peer of the realm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled harshly. “You don’t have to remind me. Put your shoes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Crossing her arms beneath her recently acquired breasts, she arched a brow and hoped she looked haughty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t push me, Amelia.” His gaze dropped, and he made an edgy sound. “Put your damn shoes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, go away!” she cried, tossing up her hands, thoroughly sick of the new Colin and slowly giving up hope for the old one. “What are you doing out here? I was having fun for the first time in ages, and you had to come along and ruin it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were gone longer than usual,” he accused gruffly. “Someone had to fetch you and keep you out of mischief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How would you know how long I was gone? The only time you notice me is when you’re surly and wish to vent on someone.” She tried to tap her foot, but the gesture lost impact when done with bare feet. “And I hardly call making friends an undesirable activity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t wish to befriend those of his ilk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish to befriend someone! I have no one since you grew to hate me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line of Colin’s lips tightened, then he ran both hands through his thick hair and groaned. She was jealous of his hands, wanting to feel those glossy strands slipping through her own fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay away from the men,” he ordered, in a tone that brooked no argument. She was preparing to argue anyway when he walked right past her and headed toward the manse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia stuck her tongue out at his broad back and struggled with the ache in her chest. He talked to no one else like he did to her, so curt and nasty. It hurt, and it fueled her dreams of running away and leaving him behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she sank to the ground and retrieved her stockings, she lamented her existence. But soon she would go to London for her presentation to the court. Then she would wed and forget about Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw tightened. “I will forget about you, Colin Mitchel . I will .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Maria woke, Christopher was gone. She lay there a moment, staring up at the canopy, attempting to make sense of their mutable association. He was waiting. Waiting for her to admit some connection to the agency that he could use. She had no notion if her admission of love for Dayton would alter his thinking. Of course, she had loved her first spouse like a favored uncle and he had looked fondly upon her as one would a favorite niece, but she thought it best to mislead the pirate on that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? she’d asked simply when the Earl of Dayton had paid Welton a small fortune to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Mathilda is gone, he answered just as simply, his kind eyes fil ed with pain. I have since found little to live for. Assisting you will give me a purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wed and retired to the country, where he used his considerable knowledge of subterfuge and combat skil s to train her. Most days they were up at dawn, and the sunlit hours were occupied in physical pursuits such as fencing and marksmanship. The evening hours were spent discussing topics such as cryptology and ways to hire men of dubious skil sets. There was nothing he left to chance, knowing she would do whatever was necessary to reclaim Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you feeling this morn?” Simon asked as he stepped into her room. He was dressed for riding, in breeches and polished Hessians. His windswept hair and the scent of horseflesh told her that he was returning, rather than leaving. “Did you sleep well ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered that question a moment, pushing fond memories of Dayton aside. “I did,” she noted with some wonder. Last night was the first occasion since seeing Amelia that she had managed to sleep without bad dreams. It was due to Christopher, she knew. The man was prepared for anything, and that made her feel safe. Odd, considering how dangerous he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went to Bernadette’s last night and spoke with Daphne.” He helped her sit up and arranged her on the pil ows. “It appears we’ve had a stroke of luck. He had a favorite, a new girl named Beth. Apparently, she had a disliking for some of his carnal proclivities, so he has begun to spend more time with Daphne, whose tastes are more diverse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria smiled. “I am in need of good luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truer words were never spoken.” He studied her careful y. “You look different this morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better, I hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Much.” His smile was breathtaking. “I will order tea and breakfast for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Simon.” She watched him as he walked away. “Eddington will come to call today,” she call ed after him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/passion-for-the-game-georgian-2/page-22.html","bookId":2659,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:44 AM"}
