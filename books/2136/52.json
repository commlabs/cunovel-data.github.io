{"id":95198,"no":52,"title":"Page 52","content":"\u003cp\u003eI was here on a hunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley\u0027s hunch, actually. He believed that the entity was primarily focused through Conner Thurman. His theory did make a kind of sense. After all, my body was immortal, impervious to death, pain, or decay. All thanks to the dark entity within me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why wouldn\u0027t Conner Thurman, who originally summoned the entity nearly a century ago, also benefit from the dark presence within him? Yes, the more I thought about it, the more I was certain that he hadn\u0027t died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner Thurman had been, of course, in the public eye. Had he been alive today, he would have been, what - I did some quick math, which was, of course, never my strong suit - and figured him to be around 125 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d faked his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was suddenly sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it felt right. Kingsley\u0027s hunch felt right. Long ago, a channeled presence had told me to trust my gut instincts. Trust my feelings. I might be able to do many things, but I could not predict the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I\u0027d had a few prophetic dreams of late. Dreams where I could, in fact, see the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this wasn\u0027t a dream. At least, I didn\u0027t think it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, dreaming and reality often blurred. So much so that I continuously questioned my own reality. The only constant was my love for my kids. They were my rock. My safety net. My love for them was more real than anything. It transcended everything. All the craziness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not for them...I would have descended, I was certain, into complete madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it together for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, someone was threatening my son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my fists and stepped deeper into what was, in fact, my first mausoleum. It was cold, yes. Dark, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo windows. Correction, two stained glass windows situated high above. The floor was a highly polished marble, now made slippery by my soaking-wet Asics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunch or not, one thing was for certain: my inner alarm was ringing loud and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere be danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a sort of long hallway with a high ceiling. On either side were shelves of some sort. The walls and shelves were composed of the same marble as the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong some of the shelves were vases and flowers. Spaced along the walls were various plaques, all depicting names and dates of births and deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy footsteps squished. Water dripped from me. I wasn\u0027t breathing, and so there was no echo of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tomb was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr should have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked my head, listening in the dead of night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there was a sound from somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused, and verified the footsteps were not my own. Indeed, they continued on, echoing within what sounded like a stairwell. My hearing was good, granted, and the acoustics of the tomb enhanced the sound wonderfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone, somewhere, was coming up a flight of stairs. I was sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flight of stairs that were directly ahead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remained motionless. I felt my normally sluggish heart pick up its pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly ahead of me, further down the narrow hall, a shaft of light suddenly appeared as a door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite myself, I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure stepped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure I immediately recognized, at least from the pictures I\u0027d seen. Conner Thurman. He looked remarkably good for being 125 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was careful to guard my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you found my home away from home, Samantha Moon,\" said a clipped and cultured voice. \"Or, rather, my home next to my home.\" He chuckled lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live here?\" I asked, finally finding my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often, although I get out as well, generally in disguise. But, yes, you could say that this is my sort of home base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I talking to Conner Thurman or the entity within? I didn\u0027t know. Perhaps a little of both. Conner was a tall man who appeared to be in his mid-forties - likely the age when he had first been possessed by the entity within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noted he was not smiling, not like the others. Also, I couldn\u0027t see his aura, nor read his mind. He was completely closed off to me. Like Kingsley, or Detective Hanner, or the other immortals I\u0027d encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I thought. He is the source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source of the curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis family\u0027s curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I was certain that Conner Thurman - the real Conner Thurman - had been overtaken completely by the entity within. Where the real Conner Thurman was, I didn\u0027t know, but I suspected he was trapped within, watching helpless within his own body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to the way the entity within me watched from within my body. Trapped within me - and wanting out. To possess me fully, similar to the way the entity now fully possessed Conner Thurman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" I asked. I was aware of movement outside the mausoleum. I suspected Allison and perhaps some others had arrived. For now, they stayed outside. Undoubtedly, they were being controlled by the entity before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a renegade of sorts, Samantha Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could say I don\u0027t play by the rules. I create my own rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What rules?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rules of life, death and our immortal souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, and my sister within you, have challenged the powers that be, so to speak. Successfully, I might add. We have effectively removed ourselves from the soul\u0027s evolutionary process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t. You see, there are universal laws in place that govern not only this world, but the worlds beyond. Others before you have created these laws, laws that govern your soul\u0027s journey through life and death. I happen to not agree with these laws, Sam. I happen to have a rather rebellious streak within me. You see, I like to do things my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so does my sister, and so do many others like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began circling around me, hands clasped behind his back. He went on, \"You see, we have figured a way out of this rat trap, Samantha Moon. And you can join us. Forever join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give my sister the freedom she seeks, and you can share in our eternal journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no refusing, my dear. You will become one of us or nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself backing away. There was the scent of something repugnant wafting off him. An actual smell of decay, perhaps. My inner alarm seemed to be blaring off the hook. Yes, I was in serious danger, I got it. I willed my own alarm to quiet down. Sometimes, the damn thing went off so loud that I couldn\u0027t hear myself think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed George Thurman and Cal Thurman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I kill when my hosts become problematic or useless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you do with my son?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner Thurman stopped pacing and faced me. \"Unfortunately, Samantha, your son consumed something very important to me. Something very important to the process of releasing my sister. But not all is lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you have figured out by now that I will need all four of the medallions to release my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing, already suspecting where this was leading. I clenched my fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, I had a willing host. My host - Conner Thurman - permitted me to take possession of his body. And I gladly did so. Oh, yes. My sister\u0027s release requires aid, if you will. That\u0027s where the medallions come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why the medallions? I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The medallions were created to aid those like you, Samantha Moon. The combination of all four together was not foreseen, and not predicted. At least, not by those who created them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped closer, and I stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed great strength within him. I suddenly very much wished that Kingsley was by my side again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fortunately, the magicks contained within the particular medallion that your son consumed are not lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do, Samantha Moon. You understand all too well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a blink of an eye, he was behind me, reaching around my throat, one hand clawing up inside my sweater. I struggled but was shocked by his strength, his speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo strong, so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand continued up over my stomach, over my breasts, up near my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, your son must now...\" he began, whispering harshly in my ear, his fingertips now pressing into the flesh of my upper chest, \"be consumed completely and totally. Every inch of him. Every drop of blood. Every hair on his head.\" He was breathing harder, faster. \"And trust me, Samantha Moon - trust me when I tell you that I will enjoy him very, very much. But first - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed, and not necessarily out of fear or anger, but because his fingers had dug deep into me. He threw me away as an excruciating pain ripped through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStumbling into the hallway wall, I gripped my chest as blood poured between my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back in horror as Conner Thurman held in one of his hands the medallion that had recently been under my skin, a medallion that was, even now, draped in my own bloodied flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One medallion down,\" he said, turning to face me, \"and three to go.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-52.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
