She studied them for a long time, then reached down to unclip his leash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, but you have to come back soon,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want either of us to get into trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona stood at the doorway of her town house, a tumbler in her hand and Nicky by her side.

He pulled it out and threw it on the floor. \"So the plan is you tranquilize me and then hunt me down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the plan is I kill you slowly,\" said Taylor. \"How does the leg feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like it has a needle stuck in it, you fuck,\" said Lehrmann. \"You better hope that shit works fast, because if I\u0027m - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped as the burning sensation kicked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurts, doesn\u0027t it?\" observed Taylor. \"At least, I hope it does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was in the needle?\" asked Lehrmann, his heart racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sizable dose of aconite,\" said Taylor. \"The pain is nasty, but then comes the numbness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aconite,\" repeated Lehrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the plant Aconitum vulparia,\" said Taylor, watching him intently. \"Commonly known as - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yellow wolfsbane,\" said Lehrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you would be familiar with it,\" continued Taylor. \"Folklore says that it\u0027s fatal to werewolves. The truth is, it\u0027s fatal to pretty much everybody. Nasty little neurotoxin in a pretty yellow flower that will kill you even if you only pick it up barehanded. I grow my own. Very carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long does it take?\" asked Lehrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The amount you just absorbed will kill a man in about an hour,\" said Taylor. \"From my experience, and I can\u0027t say that I have a large enough sample to conclude this scientifically, about ninety minutes to two hours to kill a werewolf, depending on the strength of the werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That gate opens long before that,\" said Lehrmann. \"And I am pretty damn strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A daunting prospect if you could walk,\" said Taylor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf sagged to one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The literature describes the sensation as numbness spreading through the body, eventually stopping the heart,\" said Taylor. \"The symptoms are said to be fairly unpleasant. Again, in my experience, that is a gross understatement. Werewolves seem to be particularly susceptible to it. And the best part - do you want to know the best part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" said Lehrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best part is that you will be conscious until the very end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bastard,\" muttered Lehrmann, trying to stand and failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is lovely about this particular kill is that the full moon fell on Christmas Eve again,\" said Taylor. \"Only the second time that\u0027s happened since my sister\u0027s death, given the vagaries of the lunar cycle and the solar calendar.

You may be strong, but we outnumber you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other way around,\" gasped Lehrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaldo shot across the arena, gathered himself, and leapt, crashing into the switch on the wall, then falling in a heap on the floor. The doors to the cages sprung open. There was a brief moment while everyone was silent and looking at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Playtime,\" said Lehrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all the pent-up rage and primal savagery of the pack, it was Arnie the dachshund who was the first out of his cage, baying and scampering on his short legs as hard as he could. The others took his cue and crashed into the room ahead of him. Of the four men, only Hidalgo managed to get a shot off before a pit bull clamped down on his wrist. The gun fell from his hand as he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, the hand fell from his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dogs piled on top of the four men, clawing and gouging whatever they could reach. Arnie, the last in, jumped as high as he could and sank his teeth into Taylor\u0027s thigh. The watcher, staggering under the weight of five dogs, uttered a piercing shriek, then fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicky came in, surveyed the scene, then came over to where Lehrmann lay on the floor. She looked into his eyes, then licked his paw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to see you, too,\" he said. \"Is everyone okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaldo\u0027s a little woozy from jumping into the wall. He\u0027s a good dog. I like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Max to get him home,\" he said. \"Then help me get to the tool room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran off, and he started to drag himself across the floor with his arms. Nicky came back, saw him, and gave a quick bark. Several of the larger dogs separated themselves from the carnage and ran to help. Together, they pushed the werewolf along the floor until he was inside the tool room. He tried to pull himself up, then collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona drove her Prius extremely carefully. She worried that she might be driving too carefully, a sure tip-off to any patrolling cop that she was anything but sober.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, she made it to the farm road without inflicting any damage. As she turned on to it, her headlights picked up a pair of dogs loping toward her. She stopped the car and stared. A German shepherd and a somewhat dazed Doberman looked back at her. The Doberman bared his teeth. Then she could have sworn that the German shepherd recognized her. He growled softly, and the two dogs resumed their journey past her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove on until she reached the warehouse. The front door was open. A strange cargo van was parked in front. She reached under her glove compartment and grabbed her gun. She got out of her car and walked quietly to the door. She listened for a moment, then stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately she was ringed by a pack of snarling dogs, many with their teeth and muzzles bloody, but before any of them could make a move, a familiar bark greeted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicky!\" she cried, and the Rottweiler bounded up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the pack ceased their menacing and trotted back into the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicky, where\u0027s Sam?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog whined and ran to the entrance to the tool room. She ran after her, looked inside, and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a wolf lying on the floor - no, larger than a wolf, larger than the biggest wolf who ever lived, with fangs that were bared and claws that could slice through tree trunks, and she raised her gun and was about to shoot when it rolled its eyes in her direction and whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam,\" she cried out, dropping the gun and throwing herself down to hold him tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mona,\" he breathed hoarsely. \"Medicine cabinet. Box labeled ATROPINE.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leapt to her feet and flung open the cabinet. The box was on the lower shelf. She opened it and saw three syringes, their needles capped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many and where?\" she asked, kneeling to hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two,\" he gasped. \"Right in the heart. Then wait five minutes and give me the third if there\u0027s no response.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your heart,\" she said, feeling the matted fur on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same place it always was,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t hit a rib.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the cap off the first needle and felt along his ribs under the chest until she located the gap. She took a breath, then jabbed the needle deep into his chest and pressed the plunger until it could go no farther. He grunted with pain. She removed it, repeated the process with the second, then leaned down and wrapped her arms around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if the third one doesn\u0027t work?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m dead,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSally was standing on the spot where Waldo left her, his lead in her hand. She gave a cry of relief when she saw him, then stopped when she saw the German shepherd by his side. Waldo came up and sat by her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, still groggy. She looked at the other dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a friend of his?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Mister Lehrmann train you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Sally,\" she said. \"Very nice to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog nodded once more, looked at Waldo, then ran off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas!\" she called after him. She clipped the lead onto the Doberman\u0027s collar and went home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahh!\" he cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam, do you need the third injection?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just pain,\" he gasped. \"Pain\u0027s a good sign. Means the nerves are coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a fist several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me sit up,\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached her arms around his body and pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you\u0027re heavy,\" she said, wrestling him to a sitting position against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s going to be okay,\" he said. \"My heartbeat sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re a werewolf,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Atropine doesn\u0027t cure that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re a werewolf,\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell just happened? What was the atropine for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antidote for aconite,\" he said. \"I always keep it around for special occasions like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is aconite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a poison,\" he said. \"Word got around that someone\u0027s been going after us - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us? There are more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got that right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So anyway, I got some atropine just in case some nut job decided to throw some wolfsbane in my direction. And that\u0027s pretty much what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolfsbane,\" she said, confused. \"Wait. Where is the nut job? There\u0027s a van outside - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped up, grabbed her gun, and charged back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mona!\" he called after her. \"Don\u0027t go in there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared in the doorway a minute later, the blood draining from her face, the gun dangling limply at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to go outside and be sick for a while,\" she said numbly. \"You wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she came back, he was breathing easily and bending his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought some eggnog,\" she said. \"And some marshmallows. Do werewolves eat marshmallows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t see why not,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled himself to his feet and staggered a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know I was in trouble?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t,\" she said. \"Nicky knew somehow. Dog telegraph, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know to let her go to me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked into his eyes. Still Sam\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I responded to her auditory cues,\" said Mona. \"That happens in a close relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand between his paws and pressed it to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, this is the big secret,\" she said as they walked together out of the tool room. \"All those nights you avoided me were when the moon was full. I never picked up on the pattern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t see any way of telling you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All things considered, that\u0027s understandable,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t understand it at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Christmas Eve,\" he said. \"I think a little forgiveness is in order.

He pressed the switch, and the cages closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do about those men?\" she asked, rubbing Nicky\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll put what\u0027s left of them into their van, and drive it down to the old quarry pond,\" he said. \"I should be able to sink it in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t you be leaving fingerprints?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his paws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have fingerprints right now,\" he said. \"And if they find a hair, they\u0027ll just think it was a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to mop up while you\u0027re gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll do that tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a way to spend Christmas Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could have been a whole lot worse,\" he said. \"You get a fire going outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the marshmallows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Mister Lehrmann,\" said Bert as Sam came in. \"How was your Christmas?
