She did the same with the brass wick burner, exposing the oil reservoir. Without hesitation, she poured the lamp oil over the front of the wardrobe. The pungent odor of highly flammable paraffin spread through the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you lost your mind?\" Leo demanded, astonished not only by her actions, but also by her calm demeanor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a matchbox, Julian,\" she said. \"Tell me what to give Mr. Rohan, or I\u0027ll set the wardrobe on fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t dare,\" Harrow cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Win,\" Leo said, \"you\u0027ll burn the entire damned house down, just after it\u0027s been rebuilt. Give me the bloody matchbox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head resolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we starting a new springtime ritual?\" Leo demanded. \"The annual buming-of-the-manse? Come to your senses, Win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin turned from him and glared at the wardrobe door. \"I was told, Julian, that you killed your first wife. Possibly by poison. And now knowing what you have done to my brother-in-law, I believe it. And if you don\u0027t help us, I\u0027m going to roast you like a piece of Welsh rarebit.\" She opened the matchbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing she couldn\u0027t possibly be serious, Leo decided to back her bluff. \"I\u0027m begging you, Win,\" he said theatrically, \"don\u0027t do this. There\u0027s no need to- Christl\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis last as Win struck a match and set the wardrobe on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a bluff, Leo thought dazedly. She actually intended to broil the bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first bright, curling blossom of flame, there was a terrified cry from inside the wardrobe. \"All right! Let me out! Let me out! It\u0027s tannic acid. Tannic acid. It\u0027s in my medical case; let me out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, Leo,\" Win said, a bit breathless. \"You may extinguish the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the panic that raced through his veins, Leo couldn\u0027t suppress a choked laugh. She spoke as if she\u0027d asked him to snuff a candle, not put out a large flaming piece of furniture. Tearing off his coat, he rushed forward and beat wildly at the wardrobe door. \"You\u0027re a madwoman,\" he told Win as he passed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t have told us otherwise,\" Win said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlerted by all the commotion, a few servants appeared, one of them a footman who removed his own coat and hastened to assist Leo. Meanwhile, the women were rummaging for Harrow \u0027s black leather medical case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t tannic acid the same as tea?\" Amelia asked, her hands shaking as she fumbled with the latch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mrs. Rohan,\" the governess said. \"I believe the doctor was referring to tannic acid from oak leaves, not the tannins from tea.\" She reached out quickly as Amelia nearly overturned the case. \"Careful, don\u0027t knock it over. He doesn\u0027t label his vials.\" Opening the hard-sided case, they found rows of neatly arranged glass tubes containing powders and liquids. Although the vials themselves were not marked, the slots they fit in had been identified with inked letters. Poring over the vials, Miss Marks extracted one filled with pale yellow-brown powder. \"This one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin took it from her. \"Let me take it to them,\" she said. \"I know where the campsite is. And Leo\u0027s busy putting out the wardrobe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the vial to Cam,\" Amelia said vehemently. \"He\u0027s my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And you\u0027re carrying his child. If you fell while riding at a breakneck pace, he would never forgive you for risking the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia gave her an anguished glance, her mouth trembling. She nodded and croaked, \"Hurry, Win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you fashion a sling with canvas and poles?\" Merripen asked the rom phuro. \"I must get him back to Ramsay House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tribe leader nodded at once. He called out to a small group waiting near the entrance of the vardo, gave a few instructions, and they disappeared instantly. Turning back to Merripen, he murmured, \"We\u0027ll have something put together in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev nodded, staring down at Cam \u0027s ashen face. He wasn\u0027t well by any means, but at least the threat of convulsions and heart failure had been temporarily staved off. Robbed of his usual expressiveness, Cam looked young and defenseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was peculiar to think that they were brothers and yet had spent their lives never knowing about each other. Kev had occupied his self-imposed solitude for so long, but lately it seemed to be wearing away, like a threadbare suit of clothes that was falling apart at the seams. He wanted to know more about Cam, to exchange memories with him. He wanted a brother. I always knew I wasn\u0027t supposed to be alone, Cam had told him on the day they discovered their blood ties. Kev had felt the same. He just hadn\u0027t been able to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking up a cloth, he blotted the film of sweat from Cam \u0027s face. A quiet whimper escaped Cam \u0027s lips, as if he were a child having a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, phral,\" Kev murmured, putting a hand on Cam \u0027s chest, testing the slow and lurching heartbeat. \"You\u0027ll be well soon. I won\u0027t leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are close to your brother,\" the rom phuro said softly. \"That is good. Do you have other family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We live with gadje,\" Kev said, his gaze daring the man to disapprove. The tribe leader\u0027s expression remained friendly and interested. \"One of them is his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope she\u0027s not pretty,\" the rom phuro commented. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-83.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM"}
