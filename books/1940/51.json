Really over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie shook her head. “Don’t worry. I’ve already talked to Dad. He and Andrew…well, you’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll talk to your father myself.” Bethanne couldn’t leave this to anyone else. He had to hear it from her; she was about to explain that when Andrew and Grant approached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant stepped forward and the two men eyed each other intently. Andrew clasped his dad’s shoulder and after a momentary hesitation Grant extended his hand. “I’m Grant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Max.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze shifted to Bethanne, and he hugged her, then looked back at Max. “Love her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I intend to do exactly that,” Max said. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant nodded and they exchanged handshakes. Grant turned to face Bethanne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his look and saw the pain in his eyes. He held her gaze a moment longer and whispered, “Be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed tightly. “I will.” Then her eyes met Andrew’s and she realized that the wall between her son and his father was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant moved away and greeted an old friend as if nothing of importance had taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew came forward. “You’re Max.” The comment was more statement than question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take it I have you to thank for the invitation,” Max said as they shook hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney joined them, and Andrew slipped his arm around her waist. “And this is Courtney, my wife. I imagine we’ll be seeing a lot more of you in the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax turned to Bethanne, his eyes full of warmth. “That’s certainly my intention. By the way, congratulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” Courtney smiled at him. “Andrew and I also wanted to thank you for the wine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the champagne,” Andrew added. “I’d offer you a glass but it disappeared pretty quickly after the toast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax seemed touched by their appreciation. “I wanted to do something for you. I hope your guests enjoyed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all did,” Andrew assured him. Then, looking from him to Bethanne, he said, “I hope you intend to make my mother blissfully happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax took Bethanne’s hand in his. “I plan to see to it at my earliest opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And when will that be?” Bethanne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Celebrate, Mom,” her son whispered. “This is a festive occasion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am happy.” How could she not be? Max drew her back into his embrace and they resumed dancing, held close in each other’s arms. They passed her father and Suzette on the dance floor; he smiled and gave them an outrageous wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie left soon after, and Andrew and Courtney continued to mingle with their guests. Bethanne noticed that Max’s appearance had caused a stir. She could almost hear the speculation as to who he might be and how she knew this handsome stranger. “So that is you.” Ruth marched up to Max and Bethanne, with Royce at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Ruth,” Max greeted her, releasing Bethanne yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one hand on her hip, Ruth said, “If you’d been dressed like that when we first met you, you would’ve saved me a lot of grief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you should be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax laughed out loud. “And this has to be the famous Royce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce thrust out his hand. “Glad to make your acquaintance,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Likewise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were talking to Rooster a few minutes ago,” Ruth said. “He was wearing a suit. And a tie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne nodded. “He cleans up pretty well, too, doesn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two certainly played me for a fool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Ruth, would we do that?” Max teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It appears so. Now, you listen to me, young man. For whatever reason, this girl loves you. I can’t understand it myself. She was married to my son and I have to tell you, she—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruth,” Bethanne interrupted, convinced Ruth had had one glass of champagne too many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She deserves a man who’ll love and appreciate her,” Ruth went on. “If that isn’t you, then I suggest you leave now before I make a fuss and embarrass my grandson and his bride on their wedding day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m your man,” Max said. “I plan to love Bethanne for the rest of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can shorten that life if you fail me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on here?” Robin, Grant’s sister, rushed over to them, reading the situation all wrong. “Should I contact the authorities?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, hardly,” Ruth told her. “This doesn’t concern you.” She planted her hands on her daughter’s back and steered Robin away. “By the way,” Ruth said over her shoulder, “Max, this is Robin. Robin, Max.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent her a small wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there anyone else I should meet before I take you someplace private and show you how much I’ve missed you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure.” Bethanne looked around, conscious of all the people watching her and Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I am.” With one sweep of his arms, he lifted her completely off her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne gave a cry of surprise as she slipped her own arms around his neck. His right arm was around her waist and the other supported her legs. He started toward the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such an outrageous, romantic thing to do, Bethanne didn’t know how to respond. “Put me down,” she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not on your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then at least tell me where we’re going!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re headed,” Max whispered, his eyes brimming with love, “for the rest of our lives.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-51.html","bookId":1940,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM"}
