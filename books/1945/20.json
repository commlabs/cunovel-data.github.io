She was so proud of Justine and Seth, and she felt that meeting them would prove to David that she had a good family, too. She hoped this would assuage any fears he might have about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’d made the reservation, she’d discovered that Justine was working on Tuesday afternoon and Charlotte was glad of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma,” Justine said hurrying toward her as Charlotte waited in the restaurant lobby. “It’s great to see you!” She smiled, apparently surprised that Charlotte was alone. “Where’s Ben? Wasn’t your reservation for two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the uncomfortable part. Charlotte hated misleading Ben. She’d said she was going Christmas shopping and it’d be best if he didn’t accompany her. Following lunch with David, she would indeed do some shopping. Her Christmas buying had been completed long ago, but she wouldn’t outright lie to Ben. This was merely a sin of omission. Still, small as the lie might be, Charlotte felt guilty about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a young man meeting me here,” Charlotte said, gesturing at the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you stepping out on Ben?” Justine teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte giggled. “Oh, hardly. This is Ben’s son and he asked to meet me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without Ben?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes. I have a feeling he wants to get to know me for myself, but…” She hesitated, unsure how much information about this clandestine lunch she should reveal to her granddaughter. “David must be afraid of offending his father because he didn’t want Ben to know about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you agreed?” Justine’s tone made Charlotte feel like a disobedient schoolgirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did,” she said, somewhat defiantly. “David’s a fine young man, but he’s had a falling out with his father.” Charlotte didn’t feel she was to blame for that. Their disagreement was over the money David wanted to borrow. As she spoke, she scanned the dining area. Sure enough, David sat at a table by the window overlooking the Cove. He stared into space, a drink in his hand. “That’s him there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine frowned, but said nothing. She escorted Charlotte to the table; David stood as she approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“David, it’s lovely to see you.” Charlotte kissed his cheek and as she leaned close, she could smell the alcohol on his breath. Stepping back, she introduced him to her granddaughter. “Justine and her husband own The Lighthouse,” she boasted. “They’ve made a wonderful success of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid exchanged an enthusiastic handshake with Justine, who then left them to their lunch. Knowing the menu as well as she did, Charlotte didn’t bother to open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress was by a few minutes later for their drink orders. David asked for another malt whiskey and Charlotte requested hot tea. It was barely noon yet, far too early to be drinking, in her opinion, but it wasn’t her place to chastise him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter their drinks were delivered, they ordered lunch. Charlotte chose the Northwest Salad, a recent addition to the menu. This was a Caesar salad, heaped with sautéed clams, shrimp and scallops. David decided on a rare roast beef sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress left, and Charlotte poured her tea. David, she noticed, had quickly gulped down his second drink and seemed ready for a third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I imagine you’re wondering why I asked to see you,” he said conversationally as he sought the waitress’s eye. When he saw Justine, he raised his empty glass to indicate he’d like another. “My glass seems to have developed a leak,” he teased the waitress when she promptly returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman smiled, obviously charmed by his humor and good looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I’ve figured out why you wanted to see me without Ben,” Charlotte said, stirring her tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze met hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanted an opportunity to get to know me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely,” he said, dazzling her with a smile. “You’re the first woman to capture my father’s heart since Mom died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte blushed with pleasure. “I was a widow for more than twenty-five years myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded absently. “That just goes to show that you’re never too old to fall in love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t exactly how Charlotte would’ve put it, but she did agree. “I love your father,” she said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you do, and it shows. I’ve never seen my father this happy.” He gave her another warm smile. Oh, yes, this boy was a charmer, Charlotte thought. His eyes grew serious then, and he added, “There’s also another reason I wanted to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte took a sip of tea and was about to respond when Justine brought David’s drink personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is everything all right here?” she asked. Although the question was directed at them both, she looked at Charlotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes,” Charlotte assured her. “Everything’s perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine eyed the whiskey glass, then reluctantly left the table. As she did, Charlotte noticed that David was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does she always involve herself in her diners’ affairs?” he asked. Charlotte could tell he wasn’t taking kindly to Justine’s barely disguised censure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, Justine isn’t like that,” Charlotte insisted, feeling a little awkward. “She just wants to be sure the service is good. Justine and Seth pride themselves on excellent service.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard what she wasn’t saying,” he muttered. “She’s afraid her precious grandmother isn’t safe with a man who enjoys a drink or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m absolutely sure you misconstrued the question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid’s scowl darkened and then, as if by magic, relaxed. “You’re right, of course. I was hoping for quality time to get to know you, Charlotte. Unfortunately that wasn’t possible at our last meeting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did enjoy our dinner.” It had been one of the best dining experiences she’d ever had—until the very end, when David left so abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did, too,” he agreed, “but I felt badly afterward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte nodded. David’s sudden departure had been unsettling to Ben, and to her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to apologize for my behavior during our dinner. I was…distressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte patted his hand. “I understood that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid lowered his gaze and released a beleaguered sigh. “I never did get the money I needed. I don’t think my father appreciates how hard it was to turn to him for help. I have my pride, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry about your troubles, David.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s nothing worse than not being able to meet one’s commitments. I was raised to be responsible, and now I’ve found myself in a situation where my back is to the wall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is worrisome, isn’t it?” Charlotte had lived frugally her entire life. She’d never had many luxuries but always managed to meet her needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” His face softened at her sympathy. “Who would’ve believed a measly five thousand dollars would do me in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive thousand wasn’t all that measly to Charlotte. “I’m sure you’ll find a way out of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shook his head and his brow furrowed. “Not this time.” His voice seemed to crack with the strain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you mean?” she asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shrugged. “Let’s not talk about this now. There’s no need to concern yourself with my problems. You’re a sweet, caring woman and I don’t want to ruin our lunch by discussing my troubles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I think we should. Maybe I could help.” She didn’t know what she could possibly do, but perhaps…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d be willing to do that?” David asked, relief shining from his face. “Help me, I mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I can.” An uneasy sensation settled in the pit of her stomach—the same feeling she always got when she was in over her head. “I could talk to your father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t,” David insisted. “Hard as it was, I’ve already gone to him and he refused. I don’t have much left, Charlotte, except my pride. My father knows I’m desperate, but that didn’t make any difference to him. He’s never given me much help.” He hesitated. “I shouldn’t have said that. Forgive me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” It wasn’t true either, Charlotte knew. According to Ben, he’d lent his son quite a bit of money through the years. Not once had David repaid him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need five thousand dollars, Charlotte.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sick sensation returned. “That’s a lot of money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t disagree, even though he’d considered it “measly” a few minutes earlier. “Yes,” he said, “but I have every intention of repaying you with interest. I explained this to my father, but he didn’t want to hear it. I’m due for a big Christmas bonus from my company. I know I’ll be getting a check for five grand, probably more, and it’ll come in two weeks. I only need the money until then. If I don’t get some cash now…” He sat back in his chair and sighed. “I can’t bear to think what will happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two weeks is all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid leaned forward, his eyes filled with hope. “Two weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A bank won’t lend it to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’ve tried again and again, but with my credit rating, they refuse to even talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Charlotte, if you could help me, I’d be forever in your debt.” He picked up his drink and drained the little that remained. “It could possibly save my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir lunch arrived just then, but Charlotte’s normally healthy appetite had vanished. She smiled her appreciation at their waitress and reached for her tea, needing to think carefully about this. “Save your life?” she asked, resuming their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid turned and looked out over the cove. “I don’t want to get into the medical aspects,” he said in a low voice. “It’s rather complicated….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, please tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need this money so badly, I’ve—I’ve considered—” he paused, dropping his head “—suicide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte’s hand flew to her heart and she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I don’t have the surgery…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte hadn’t recovered from the first shock and now there was a second one. “The money is for surgery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded. “Funny, isn’t it? No one’s ever asked me why I need the five thousand dollars. My father assumes it’s to pay off gambling debts. That’s just like him. Sad as it is to say, my own father chooses to think the worst of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need surgery?” Her mind was reeling with this information. Surely Ben would have given him the money if he’d known that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid’s eyes were weary. “I won’t humble myself any more than I have already. You know what hospitals are like. They want the money up front before they’ll agree to do any kind of procedure.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/50-harbor-street-cedar-cove-5/page-20.html","bookId":1945,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:30 AM"}
