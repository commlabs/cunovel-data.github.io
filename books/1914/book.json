Fleeing for San Francisco the minute she graduated high school seemed like a good idea—until she lost her job and her fiancé. The blow to her pride sent her back to Sierra Falls to figure out her life. But her hometown is undergoing a bit of renovation. A new Sierra Falls resort is posing a threat to the Bailey family business. Even worse, the construction company developing the property is run by Eddie Jessup, Laura’s cocky high school nemesis who delighted in locking horns with the little spitfire. Some things never change. But their battle isn’t the only thing heating up between Laura and Eddie, and before long they realize that getting to know each other all over again has its rewards. But fate isn’t through with them. Nor are the games men and women play in the name of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/timber-creek-sierra-falls-2.jpg","author":"Veronica Wolff","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/timber-creek-sierra-falls-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:07 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:28 PM"}
