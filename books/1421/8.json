A MIDNIGHT CRIME.","content":"How oft men use the gifts of God\n\u003cbr\u003e To aid their plans and cloak their sins;\n\u003cbr\u003e At nightfall, silence reigns above\n\u003cbr\u003e And deviltry on earth begins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The noise was merely the shivering to atoms of a small venetian vase which stood on a diminutive ebony table not far from the divan on which Stella was seated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Sinclair had accidently struck the table, and the gossips declared afterward, in the privacy of their own Boudoirs, that she was watching her son at the very time when his accidental touching of Stella\u0027s hand had wrought so fearful a change upon his features, and, quite naturally, they argued that an intuitive fear for her adopted daughter\u0027s future made her hand unsteady. At any rate, she had turned[Pg 55] suddenly pale and grasped the slender table for support with the result already mentioned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurice sprang promptly forward, and motioning to a servant to remove the fragments of glass, offered his arm gracefully to his mother and passed up the room to where the Countess Martinet was sitting with her angular daughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stella took this opportunity to join the Misses Huntington on a neighboring sofa and again the strains of music floated through the spacious parlors and partners were soon whirling gaily about in the witcheries of a glorious waltz.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Never had Stella looked so superbly beautiful as to-night, with the graceful folds of her exquisite white satin draperies clinging about her charming figure. The gold of her hair scintillated in myriad iridescent rays about her broad forehead and snowy neck, while the gleaming diamond star that shown upon her bosom vied with the sparkling lustre of her eye, and in the opinions of the gentlemen, at least, paled woefully in the comparison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before this enjoyable ball was over it was no wonder that hearts, adoration and homes were silently or in hurried, eager whispers, laid humbly[Pg 56] upon the altar of love, and many an ardent lover went home that night to dream of heavenly raptures or exactly the reverse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To Stella, however, the sentiment of all absorbing passion was, as yet unknown. Life was at its best and brightest with her, and the brief, inexplicable sensation of fear which she had felt at Maurice\u0027s touch, was the only cloud, small and visionary as it was, that in any way darkened the skies of her perfect happiness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fog was still resting heavily upon the earth when the last carriage rolled away and Maurice walked with his mother up the broad stairs to spend his first night in ten years beneath the parental roof.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some way Stella lingered longer than usual that night over her adieux to Sir Frederic Atherton, but the fault, if fault it was, could not be laid at her door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His carriage was the last and if he held her hand a moment longer than usual, she reasoned that, it was only because he had known her from childhood and now, at her debut into the world of womanly duties and pleasures, it was only natural that he[Pg 57] should feel a desire to congratulate and perhaps advise her for her future welfare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was with this idea in mind that she let her hand rest quietly in his and raised her eyes so confidently to his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What she saw there was neither the courteous smile of congratulation or the benign bearing of one about to offer sage admonition. Instead, she saw a look of such ineffable tenderness bent upon her, that to her inmost soul there came an instantaneous sense of security, protection and sacred confidence, and tears suffused her lovely eyes in a blinding flood of gratitude which she was powerless to control.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Another instant and his lips had touched her golden hair, and the sound of the departing carriage told her he was gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a curious feeling of loneliness and amazement thereat, she followed, almost in a dream, to Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stella said good night as soon as possible, thinking that in all probability mother and son would wish to converse on many topics of interest, but as she passed from the room she turned and[Pg 58] smiling sweetly, said, \"I am sorry to usurp your old quarters in the west wing, Maurice, but we thought I had better not change as the south room might be more grateful to your warm country tastes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With this slightly saucy allusion to his mysterious past, Stella kissed her finger tips to Mrs. Sinclair and closed the door softly behind her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After Stella had gone Maurice seemed suddenly fatigued. The light vanished from his eyes and his tones grew languid, while a certain nervousness of manner betrayed to Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s acute perceptions the fact that, for some reason, her son felt ill at ease in his mother\u0027s presence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kissing him fondly she made haste to say, \"Now darling, you had better go right to your room. We shall have plenty of time to talk in the future, for I am an old woman now and I trust my son will never feel like leaving me again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How old is Stella, mother?\" was his somewhat irrelevant remark when she had finished speaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is twenty-one to day, my son, and I think you will agree that a sweeter, truer woman could[Pg 59] hardly be imagined,\" responded his mother warmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is very beautiful,\" Maurice began, but checking himself, he said abruptly, \"I have spent the last three years of my life wandering about in the heart of the Great Desert of Shamo, and some times I fancy the sulphurous fumes and heat of its burning lakes have impregnated my blood and tainted my whole system with a substance, which, although capable of overcoming other impurities, is but a poor choice between the natural and the acquired evil.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here, seeing his mother\u0027s look of complete mystification, he paused and added playfully, \"Ah, mother, I have frightened and perplexed you all ready: I must retire and to-morrow you shall say whether I am brute or human, for in truth, some times I can hardly tell.\" With these words he laughed a low, musical and extraordinarily joyous laugh that had attracted her once before that evening, then touching his mother\u0027s cheek lightly with his lips, went hurriedly from the room, through the hall and up the wide staircase.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On reaching the hall above he paused for a[Pg 60] moment as if in doubt and then turned abruptly toward the west wing and, notwithstanding Stella\u0027s parting words, passed swiftly on until he reached the door of his \"old quarters,\" then he drew a small, odd looking vial from his pocket and with it still in his hand, turned the handle and without word or warning, quietly entered the room.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74767.html","bookId":1421,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM"}
