Don’t make me ask the question again.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ma’am, be well twenty and one. Once their bearin’ days are done. Mostly.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you have been working hard at keeping the Tiste Edur away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No business a theirs, ma’am.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor mine. Yet… not entirely true, is it? ‘End the curse, Pully. You’ve done enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Boaral killed more Shake than any other Dresh, ma’am. You know that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘End it,’ Twilight said, opening her eyes and facing the two women, ‘or your heads will be in sacks and buried deep in Noose Bog before this night is out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePully and her companion grinned at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am of the shore,’ Yan Tovis said in a hard voice. ‘My Shake name is Twilight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hags suddenly backed away, then sank down onto their knees, heads bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘End the curse,’ Twilight said again. ‘Will you defy princess of the Last Blood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Princess no longer,’ Pully said to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis felt the blood drain from her face-if not for the wall she leaned against she would have staggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your mother died be well a year past,’ Pully said in a soft, sad voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other witch added, ‘Crossin’ from the Isle, the boat overturning. They say it was some demon o’ the deep, pushed too close by dark magic out at sea-the same magic, my Queen, as could be well squirted Master at Arms west as they say. A demon, up unner the boat, an’ all drowned. Whisperin’ from the waters, my Queen, dark and well nigh black.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis drew a deep breath. To be Shake was to know grief. Her mother was dead, now a face emptied of life. Well, she had not seen the woman in over a decade, had she? So, why this pain? Because there is something else. ‘What is the name of the Master at Arms, Pully?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yedan Derryg, Highness. The Watch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-brother I have never met. The one who ran-from his blood, from everything. Ran nearly as far as I did. And yet, was that old tale even true? The Watch was here, after all, a mere bell’s ride from the shore. She understood now why he had ridden out on this night. Something else, and this is it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis drew her cloak about herself, began pulling on her gauntlets. ‘Feed well my soldiers. I will return with Derryg by dawn.’ As she turned to the door she paused. The madness afflicting the Dresh, Pully.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her the witch replied, ‘Be well too late for him, Highness. But we will scour the Black Stone this night. Before the Edur arrive.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, I sent for them, didn’t I? ‘I imagine,’ she said, her gaze fixed on the door, ‘the summary execution of Dresh Boaral will be something of a mercy for the poor man.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou mean to do it before the Edur come here as they say, Highness?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Pully. He will die, I suppose, trying to flee arrest.’ After a moment, she asked, ‘Pully, how many shoulder-women are left?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘More than two hundred, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My Queen,’ ventured the other, ‘word will be sent out, cob to web as they say, before the sun’s rise. You have been j chosen a betrothed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have, have I? Who?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shake Brullyg, of the Isle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And does my betrothed remain on Second Maiden Fort?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We think so, Highness,’ Pully replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that she turned round. ‘You don’t know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The web’s been snapped, Highness. Almost a month now. Ice an’ dark and whisperings, we cannot reach across the waves. The shore is blind to the sea, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shore is blind to the sea. ‘Has such a thing ever occurred before?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth witches shook their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwilight swung about and hastened outside. Her riders awaited her, already mounted, silent with fatigue. She strode to the horse bearing her saddle-a chestnut gelding, the fittest of the lot, she could see in the torchlight-and pulled herself onto its broad back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Atri-Preda?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To the coast,’ she said, gathering the reins. ‘At the canter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s wrong with them?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hound Master’s face was ravaged with distress, tears streaming down his wind-burned cheeks and glistening like sweat in his beard. ‘They’ve been poisoned, Atri-Preda! Poisoned meat, left on the ground-I’m going to lose them all!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-178.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
