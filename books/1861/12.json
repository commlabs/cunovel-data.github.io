It\u0027s like last night never happened, but I wonder if it\u0027s an act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a feeling that today is going to be full of rainbows and sunshine,\" Lila says cheerily as she applies her lipstick, using the mirror on the closet door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst my protest, she took down some of my sketches, so she could see her reflection. \"See what, though?\" I\u0027d asked and she laughed, totally confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you high?\" I tease as I twist my hair onto the back of my head and secure it with a clip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses, looking at me over her shoulder. \"Why do you always ask questions like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slip on my boots and tie up the laces. \"What kinds of questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blots her lips. \"Every time I\u0027m happy, you always ask if I\u0027m drunk or on something. People can be happy without substances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clasp a watch around my wrist. \"Most people can, but not all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila clips a diamond earring in. \"You look really nice today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance down at the black and purple dress I have on and the boots on my feet. \"I forgot to do laundry so I had to wear some of my old clothes, which don\u0027t match any of my new shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well you look nice.\" She gives an elongated pause. \"So what\u0027s on the agenda for today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends on what you\u0027re doing?\" I ask. \"Are you... where are you planning on staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuts off her phone and then discards it onto the bed. \"I\u0027d like to stick around with you for a while, if you don\u0027t mind. We could hang out. I don\u0027t have anything scheduled for the summer and I\u0027m not going back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to tell me what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay... well, I need to find a job,\" I say. \"I have to save up for the rest of my tuition since it doesn\u0027t look like I\u0027ll be getting that internship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts a headband in her hair. \"The one at that art museum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the one and it doesn\u0027t start until mid-June,\" I explain. \"But that\u0027s only five weeks away, so I figured they\u0027d have notified me if I got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never know. Sometimes things like that move slow.\" She folds up a shirt and packs it into her bag, then ties a ribbon on the back of her shirt. \"Although, if you get it that\u0027d mean you\u0027d have to go back to Vegas, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, I head for the door. Two weeks ago the idea of returning to the desert would make me happy, but something\u0027s changed. I still want to go, though leaving will be a little bit harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI collect my phone off the dresser, noting the flashing voicemail on the screen - Micha\u0027s unread message. My finger hovers above the button as I step into the hall. He told me I wasn\u0027t ready for what was on it? But am I ready for it now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why you think it\u0027s so bad here.\" Lila follows me. \"Yeah, people are a little rough, but they\u0027re not all bad and everywhere has bad stuff. You can\u0027t hide from it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very insightful.\" I close my phone and put it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad comes in different forms,\" Lila continues. \"Whether it\u0027s drug dealers on the corner or if it\u0027s corrupt rich people or just your run-of-the-mill douche bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know much about Lila, other than she\u0027s rich, her dad works as a lawyer and her mom stays home. She likes clothes, is great with numbers and was the only reason I passed pre-calculus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother\u0027s door is open and he walks out as we\u0027re passing by. He has a black and red polo shirt on and a pair of cargo pants. There\u0027s some kind of gel in his hair and it looks shiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, have you seen dad?\" he asks, giving an acknowledging glance at Lila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point at the shut door at the end of the hall. \"I thought I heard him come in late last night and go into his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did, but he got up this morning.\" He leans against the doorframe and crosses his arms. \"I heard him stumbling around in that bathroom and crying all night, but now I can\u0027t find him and I didn\u0027t hear him leave. His work called the house, saying he didn\u0027t show up, so he\u0027s not there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fists clench so that my nails dig into my palms. \"Did you check in the bathroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean\u0027s eyes travel down the hall to the bathroom door and he shakes his head. \"I haven\u0027t and I don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, I\u0027m Lila,\" she introduces herself and offers her hand. \"You must be Ella\u0027s brother, Dean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean is vaguely amused and shakes her hand. \"Yeah... how do you know Ella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was her roommate,\" she responds, pressing her hand to her chest, faking being offended. \"Didn\u0027t she ever mention me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t talk that much.\" I eye the bathroom door again and my stomach twists. \"We need to find Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not looking in that bathroom, Ella, but if you want to, go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith legs flimsier than wet noodles, I walk down the dark hallway and stop in front of the door, having a flashback of the day my mom died. The door was closed and the house was soundless, except for the running of water. My hands tremble as I open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room is bare, the tub empty, and the tile floor is clean, except for a small stain. There are no towels on the hooks and the mirror on the wall across from me shows my reflection. My auburn hair is curled perfectly in place, my lips are lined with gloss, and my green eyes are immense and reveal everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad isn\u0027t in here,\" I tell him, unable to look away from the mirror. \"Are you sure you didn\u0027t hear him leave the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have left and I just didn\u0027t hear him,\" he answers. \"But when has he ever left the house quietly before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly slam the bathroom door, like I\u0027m trying to put out a fire, and race back down the hall. \"Someone needs to find him. Did you try and call him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027m not a moron.\" He rolls his eyes and nods. \"And he didn\u0027t answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila shifts her weight and forces the uncomfortable conversation elsewhere. \"So you play the drums, Dean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motions to his drum set in the middle of his small room with dark blue walls. The floor and bed are cluttered with boxes and the curtain is pulled back, letting the sunlight spill in. \"I used to, but I don\u0027t much anymore. I have work and a fiance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fiance?\" Lila and I say simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, as in we\u0027re engaged.\" Dean rolls his eyes and goes back into his room. \"It\u0027s what happens when two people date for a really long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" I ask, following him into his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picks up a small box and drops it onto the floor. \"Do you really care that I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carefully nudge the box out of the way with my foot. \"You\u0027re my brother. Of course I care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not like we\u0027ve ever really gotten along,\" he points out. \"I haven\u0027t even talked to you for a year. God, I didn\u0027t even know you went to college until a week ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right, which is sad. I barely know him, he barely knows me, and I\u0027m starting to think I barely know me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Dad know you\u0027re engaged?\" I ask. \"Were you at least planning on telling him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I told him, he\u0027d just forget the next day.\" He empties a dresser drawer into a large open box and then aligns the drawer back into place. \"You know how he is. Christ, I don\u0027t even think half the time he knows that you and I don\u0027t live here anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He still deserves to be told,\" I say. \"He\u0027s not a bad guy and you know it. He just has problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problems that fucked up our childhood.\" He kicks a box out of the way with force and it crashes into the wall. \"You do realize that how we grew up wasn\u0027t normal. God, even Micha had it easier and his dad bailed out on him, but at least he had a stable mom to take care of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm...\" Lila pokes her head in the room. \"I think I\u0027m going to wait outside for you, Ella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I\u0027d forgotten she was even there and she just heard all of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll be down in a second,\" I tell her and she leaves readily. I wander around Dean\u0027s room, taking in the photos he has up. \"I think we may have just scared her to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean picks up his drumsticks and places them into a large duffel bag. \"Okay, I have to ask. How did you end up being friends with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was my roommate and we just sort of bonded.\" I shrug, picking up a photo of Dean and his friends on a sunny beach. It was taken during his Senior Field Trip and he looks happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bonded,\" he accuses. \"The girl looks like a spoiled princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eye his preppy clothes. \"So do you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First off, I\u0027m not a princess and I\u0027ve earned what I have,\" he says. \"It wasn\u0027t just handed to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she did, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate to give him the benefit of being right. \"No, her parents are pretty well off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me with that stupid arrogant expression he gets when I admit he\u0027s right. \"Well, there you have it then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s nice,\" I protest. \"And she doesn\u0027t ask a lot of questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may seem like you need to keep things to yourself,\" he says, putting a blanket into a box. \"But it\u0027s not healthy. You need to find someone you can let it all out to. Otherwise you\u0027re going to lose it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes roam to the window where the edge of Micha\u0027s house is visible. \"I think I already did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean\u0027s forehead creases as he drops a handful of guitar picks into a trunk. \"Lose it? Or talk to someone about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\" I back toward the door. \"When are you heading back to Chicago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully by tonight. No offense or anything, but this place brings back way too many unpleasant memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to say good-bye before you leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t respond and I don\u0027t wait around for an answer. That was probably the longest conversation that we\u0027ve ever had and I have a feeling it may be our last for a very long time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-12.html","bookId":1861,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM"}
