Separate drives of sandtrout and sandworm produced a new meaning for the word pain. He felt that he was being ripped apart. Sandtrout wanted to rush to the water and encapsulate it. Sandworm felt the drenching wash of death. Curls of blue smoke \u0027spurted from every place the rain touched him. The inner workings of his body began to manufacture the true spice-essence. Blue smoke lifted around him from where he lay in puddles of water. He writhed and groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clouds passed and it was a few moments before Siona sensed his disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was unable to answer. The rain was gone but water remained on the rocks and in puddles all around and beneath him. There was no escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona saw the blue smoke rising from every place the water touched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the water!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slightly higher bulge of land off to the right where the water did not stay. Painfully, he made his way toward it, groaning at each new puddle. The bulge was almost dry when he reached it. The agony subsided slowly and he grew aware that Siona stood directly in front of him. She probed at him with words of false concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does water hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurt? What an inadequate word! There was no evading her questions, though. She knew enough now to go searching for the answer. That answer could be found. Haltingly, he explained the relationship of sandtrout and sandworm to water. She heard him out in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the moisture you gave me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is buffered and masked by the spice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you risk it out here without your cart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be a Fremen in the Citadel or on a cart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the flame of rebellion return to her eyes. She did not have to feel guilty or dependent. She no longer could avoid belief in his Golden Path, but what difference did that make? His cruelties could not be forgiven! She could reject him, deny him a place in her family. He was not a human, not like her at all. And she possessed the secret of his undoing! Ring him with water, destroy his desert, immobilize him within a moat of agony! Did she think she hid her thoughts from him by turning away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what can I do about it? he wondered. She must live now while I must demonstrate nonviolence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he knew something of. Siona\u0027s nature, how easy it would be to surrender, to sink blindly into his own thoughts. It was seductive, this talon to live only within his memories, but his children still required another lesson-by-example if they were to escape the last threat to the Golden Path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a painful decision! He experienced a new sympathy for the Bene Gesserit. His quandary was akin to the one they had experienced when they had confronted the fact of Muad\u0027Dib. The ultimate goal of their breeding program-my father-they could not contain him, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more into the breach, dear friends, he thought. and he suppressed a wry smile at his own histrionics. -\u003d Given enough time for the generations to evolve, the predator produces particular survival adaptations in its prey which, through the circular operation of feedback, produce changes in the predator which again change the prey etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... Many powerful forces do the same thing. You can count religions among such forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals \"THE LORD has commanded me to tell you that your daughter lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla delivered the message to Moneo in a singsong voice, looking down across the workroom table at his figure seated there amidst a chaos of notes and papers and communications instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo pressed his palms together firmly and looked down at the elongated shadow drawn on his table by late afternoon sunlight across the jeweled tree of his paperweight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up at Nayla\u0027s stocky figure standing at proper attention in front of him, he asked: \"Both of them have returned to the Citadel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo looked out the window to his left, not really seeing the flinty borderline of darkness hanging on the Sareer\u0027s horizon nor the greedy wind collecting sand grains from every dunetop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That matter which we discussed earlier?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has been arranged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\" He waved to dismiss her, but Nayla remained standing in front of him. Surprised, Moneo actually focused on her for the first time since she had entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it required that I personally attend this-\" she swallowed-\"wedding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lord Leto has commanded it. You will be the only one there armed with a lasgun. It is an honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained in position, her gaze fixed somewhere over Moneo\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" he prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla\u0027s great lantern jaw worked convulsively, then: \"He is God and I am mortal.\" She turned on one heel and left the workroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo wondered vaguely what was bothering that hulking Fish Speaker, but his thoughts turned like a compass arrow to Siona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has survived as I did. Siona now had an inner sense which told her that the Golden Path remained unbroken. As I have. He found no sense of sharing in this, nothing to make him feel closer to his daughter. It was a burden and it would inevitably curb her rebellious nature. No Atreides could go against the Golden Path. Leto had seen to that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo remembered his own rebel days. Every night a new bed and the constant urge to run. The cobwebs of his past clung to his mind, sticking there no matter how hard he tried to shake away troublesome memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona has been caged. As I was caged. As poor Leto was caged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tolling of the nightfall bell intruded on his thoughts and activated his workroom\u0027s lights. He looked down at the work still undone in preparation for the God Emperor\u0027s wedding to Hwi Noree. So much work! Presently, he pressed a call-button and asked the Fish Speaker acolyte who appeared at the summons to bring him a tumbler of water and then call Duncan Idaho to the workroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned quickly with the water and placed the tumbler near his left hand on the table. He noted the long fingers, a lute-player\u0027s fingers, but did not look up at her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have sent someone for Idaho,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and went on with his work. He heard her leave and only then did he look up to drink the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome live lives like summer moths, he thought. But I have burdens without end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water tasted flat. It weighed down his senses, making his body feel torpid. He looked out at the sunset colors on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSareer as they shaded away into darkness, thinking that he should recognize beauty in that familiar sense, but all he could think was that the light changed in its own patterns. It is not moved by me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the full darkness, the light level of his workroom increased automatically, bringing a clarity of thought with it. He felt himself quite prepared for Idaho. This one had to be taught the necessities, and quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo\u0027s door opened, the acolyte again. \"Will you eat now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later.\" He raised a hand as she started to leave. \"I would like the door left open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may practice your music,\" he said. \"I want to listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a smooth, round, almost childlike face which became radiant when she smiled. The smile still on her lips, she turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, he heard the sounds of a biwa lute in the outer office. Yes, that young acolyte had a talent. The bass strings were like rain drumming on a rooftop, a whisper of middle strings underneath. Perhaps she could move up to the baliset someday. He recognized the song: a deeply humming memory of autumn wind from some faraway planet where they had never known a desert. Sad music, pitiful music, yet marvelous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the cry of the caged, he thought. The memory of free- dom. This thought struck him as odd. Was it always the case that freedom required rebellion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lute fell silent. There came the sound of low voices. Idaho entered the workroom. Moneo watched him enter. A trick of light gave Idaho a face like a grimacing mask with pitted eyes. Without invitation, he sat down across from Moneo and the trickery was gone. Just another Duncan. He had changed into a plain black uniform without insignia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been asking myself a peculiar question,\" Idaho said. \"I\u0027m glad you summoned me. I want to ask this question of you. What is it, Moneo, that my predecessor did not learn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiff with surprise, Moneo sat up straight. What an unDuncan question! Could there be a peculiar Tleilaxu difference in this one after all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What prompts this question?\" Moneo asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking like a Fremen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t a Fremen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closer to it than you think. Stilgar the Naib once said I was probably born Fremen without knowing it until I came to Dune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens when you think like a Fremen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember that you should never be in company that you wouldn\u0027t want to die with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo put his hands palms down on the surface of his table. A wolfish smile came over Idaho\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you doing here?\" Moneo asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspect that you may be good company, Moneo. And I ask myself why Leto would choose you as his closest companion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I passed the test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same one your daughter passed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he has heard they are back. It meant some of the Fish Speakers were reporting things to him... unless the God Emperor had summoned the Duncan... No, I would have heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tests are never identical,\" Moneo said. \"I was made to go alone into a cavern maze with nothing but a bag of food and a vial of spice-essence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which did you choose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh... if you are tested, you will learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a Leto I don\u0027t know,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I not told you this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s a Leto you don\u0027t know,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s the loneliest person this universe has ever seen,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play mood games trying to arouse my sympathy,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mood games, yes. That\u0027s very good,\" Moneo nodded. \"The God Emperor\u0027s moods are like a river-smooth where nothing obstructs him, foaming and violent at the least suggestion of a barrier. He is not be be obstructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho looked around at the brightly lighted workroom, turned his gaze to the outside darkness and thought about the tamed course of the Idaho River somewhere out there. Bringing his attention back to Moneo, he asked: \"What do you know of rivers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my youth, I traveled for him. I have even trusted my life to a floating shell of a vessel on a river and then on a sea whose shores were lost in the crossing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, Moneo felt that he had brushed against a clue to some deep truth in the Lord Leto. The sensation dropped Moneo into reverie, thinking of that far planet where he had crossed a sea from one shore to another. There had been a storm on the first evening of that passage and, somewhere deep within the ship, an irritating non-directional \"sug-sug-sug-sugsug\" of laboring engines. He had stood on deck with the captain. His mind had kept focusing on the engine sound, retreating and coming back to it like the oversurging of the watery green-black mountains which passed and came, repeating and repeating. Each down crash of the keel opened the sea\u0027s flesh like a fist smashing. It was insane motion, a sodden shaking, up... up, down! His lungs had ached with repressed fear. The lunging of the ship and the sea trying to put them down-wild explosions of solid water, hour after hour, white blisters of water spilling off the decks, then another sea and another...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this was a clue to the God Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is both the storm and the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo focused on Idaho seated across the table from him in the workroom\u0027s cold light. Not a tremor in the man, but a hungering was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you will not help me learn what the other Duncan Idahos did not learn,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I will help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what have I always failed to learn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How to trust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho pushed himself back from the table and glared at Moneo. When Idaho\u0027s voice came, it was harsh and rasping: \"I\u0027d say I trusted too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo was implacable. \"But how do you trust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo put his hands in his lap. \"You choose male companions for their ability to fight and die on the side of right as you see it. You choose females who can complement this masculine view of yourself. You allow for no differences which can come from good will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething moved in the doorway to Moneo\u0027s workroom. He looked up in time to see Siona enter. She stopped, one hand on her hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, father, up to your old tricks, I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho jerked around to stare at the speaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo studied her, looking for signs of the change. She had bathed and put on a fresh uniform, the black and gold of Fish Speaker command, but her face and hands still betrayed the evidence of her desert ordeal. She had lost weight and her cheekbones stood out. Unguent did little to conceal cracks in her lips. Veins stood out on her hands. Her eyes looked ancient and her expression was that of someone who had tasted bitter dregs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been listening to you two,\" she said. She dropped her hand from her hip and moved farther into the room. \"How dare you speak of good will, father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho had noted the uniform. He pursed his lips in thought. Fish Speaker Command? Siona?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand your bitterness,\" Moneo said. \"I -had similar feelings once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really?\" She came closer, stopping just beside Idaho, who continued to regard her with a look of speculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am filled with joy to see you alive,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How gratifying. for you to see me safely into the God Emperor\u0027s Service,\" she said. \"You waited so long to have a child and look! See how successful I am.\" She turned slowly to display her uniform. \"Commander of the Fish Speakers. A commander with a troop of one, but nonetheless a commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo forced his voice to be cold and professional. \"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer to stand.\" She looked down at Idaho\u0027s upturned face. \"Ahhh, Duncan Idaho, my intended mate. Don\u0027t you find this interesting, Duncan? The Lord Leto tells me I will befitted into the command structure of the Fish Speakers in time. Meanwhile, I have one attendant. Do you know the one called Nayla, Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I think perhaps I don\u0027t know her.\" Siona looked at Moneo. \"Do I know her, father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you speak of trust, father,\" Siona said. \"Who does the powerful minister, Moneo, trust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho turned to see the effect of these words on the majordomo. The man\u0027s face appeared brittle with repressed emotion. Anger? No... something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trust the God Emperor,\" Moneo said. \"And, in the hope that it will teach both of you something, I am here to convey his wishes to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His wishes!\" Siona taunted. \"Hear that, Duncan? The God Emperor\u0027s commands are now wishes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak your piece,\" Idaho said. \"I know we have little choice in whatever it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always have a choice,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t listen to him,\" Siona said. \"He\u0027s full of tricks. They expect us to fall into each other\u0027s arms and breed more like my father. Your descendant, my father!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo\u0027s face went pale. He gripped the edge of his worktable with both hands and leaned forward. \"You are both fools! But I will try to save you. In spite of yourselves, I will try to save you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho saw Moneo\u0027s cheeks tremble, the intensity of the man\u0027s stare, and felt oddly moved by this. \"I\u0027m not his stud, but I\u0027ll listen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always a mistake,\" Siona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be still, woman,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at the top of Idaho\u0027s head. \"Don\u0027t address me that way or I\u0027ll wrap your neck around your ankles!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho stiffened and started to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo grimaced and waved a hand for Idaho to remain seated. \"I caution you, Duncan, that she could probably do it. I am no match for her and you do recall your attempt at violence against me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho inhaled a deep, quick breath, let it out slowly, then: \"Say what you have to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona moved to perch at the end of Moneo\u0027s table and looked down at both of them. \"Much better,\" she said. \"Let him have his say, but don\u0027t listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho pressed his lips tightly together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo released his grip on the edge of his desk. He sat back and looked from Idaho to Siona. \"I have almost completed the arrangements for the God Emperor\u0027s wedding to Hwi Noree. During those festivities, I want you both out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona turned a questioning look on Moneo. \"Your idea or his?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine!\" Moneo returned his daughter\u0027s glare. \"Have you no sense of honor and duty? Have you learned nothing from being with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I learned what you learned, father. And I gave my word, which I will keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll command the Fish Speakers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever he trusts me with command. You know, father, he\u0027s ever so much more devious than you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you sending us?\" Idaho asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Provided we agree to go,\" Siona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a small village of Museum Fremen at the edge of the Sareer,\" Moneo said. \"It is called Tuono. The village is relatively pleasant. It\u0027s in the shadow of the Wall with the river just beyond the Wall. There is a well and the food is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuono? Idaho wondered. The name sounded familiar. \"There was a Tuono Basin on the way to Sietch Tabr,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the nights are long and there\u0027s no entertainment,\" Siona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho shot a sharp glance at her. She returned it. \"He wants us breeding and the Worm satisfied,\" she said. \"He wants babies in my belly, new lives to warp and twist. I\u0027ll see him dead before I\u0027ll give him that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho looked back at Moneo with a bemused expression. \"And if we refuse to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ll go,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona\u0027s lips twitched. \"Duncan, have you even seen one of these little desert villages? No comforts, no...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen Tabur Village,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure that is a metropolis beside Tuono. Our God Emperor would not celebrate his nuptials in any cluster of mud hovels! Oh, no. Tuono will be mud hovels and no amenities, as close to the original Fremen as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho kept his attention on Moneo while speaking: \"Fremen did not live in mud huts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares where they conducted their cultish games?\" she sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill looking at Moneo, Idaho said: \"Real Fremen had only one cult, the cult of personal honesty. I worry more about honesty than about comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t expect comfort from me!\" Siona snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t expect anything from you,\" Idaho said. \"When would we leave for this Tuono, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am considering an acceptance of your father\u0027s kindness,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kindness!\" She looked from Idaho to Moneo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would leave immediately,\" Moneo said. \"I have detailed a detachment of Fish Speakers under Nayla to escort you and provide for you at Tuono.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nayla?\" Siona asked. \"Really? Will she stay with us there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until the day of the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona nodded slowly. \"Then we accept.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accept for yourself!\" Idaho snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona smiled. \"Sorry. May I formally request that the great\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan Idaho join me at this primitive garrison where he will keep his hands off my person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho peered up at her from under his brows. \"Have no fears about where I will put my hands.\" He looked at Moneo. \"Are you being kind, Moneo? Is that why you\u0027re sending me away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a question of trust,\" Siona said. \"Who does he trust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I be forced to go with your daughter?\" Idaho insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona stood. \"We either accept or the troopers will bind us and carry us out in a most uncomfortable fashion. You can see it in his face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I really have no choice,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the choice anyone has,\" Siona said. \"Die now or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Idaho stared at Moneo. \"Your real intentions, Moneo? Won\u0027t you satisfy my curiosity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curiosity has kept many people alive when all else failed,\" Moneo said. \"I am trying to keep you alive, Duncan. I have never done that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- \u003d It required almost a thousand years before the dust of Dune\u0027s old planet-wide desert left the atmosphere to be bound up in soil and water. The wind called sandblaster has not been seen on Arrakis for some twenty-five hundred years. Twenty billion tons of dust could be carried suspended in the wind of just one of those storms. The sky often had a silvery look to it then. Fremen said: \"The desert is a surgeon cutting away the skin to expose what\u0027s underneath.\" The planet and the people had layers. You could see them. My Sareer is but a weak echo of what was. I must be the sandblaster today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals \"You sent them to Tuono without consulting me? How surprising of you, Moneo! You\u0027ve not done such an independent thing in a long while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo stood about ten paces from Leto in the gloomy center of the crypt, head bowed, using every artifice he knew to keep from trembling, aware that even this could be seen and interpreted by the God Emperor. It was almost midnight. Leto had kept his majordomo waiting and waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pray I have not offended my Lord,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have amused me, but take no heart from that. Lately, I cannot separate the comic from the sad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, Lord,\" Moneo whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this forgiveness you ask? Must you always require judgment? Can\u0027t your universe merely be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo lifted his gaze to that awful cowled face. He is both ship and storm. The sunset exists in itself. Moneo felt that he stood on the brink of terrifying revelations. The God Emperor\u0027s eyes bored into him, burning, probing. \"Lord, what would you have of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you have faith in yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling that something might explode in him, Moneo said: \"Then the fact that I did not consult you before...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How enlightened of you, Moneo! Small souls who seek power over others first destroy the faith those others might have in themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were shattering to Moneo. He sensed accusation in them, confession. He felt his hold on a fearsome but infinitely desirable thing weakening. He tried to find words to call it back, but his mind remained blank. Perhaps if he asked the God Emperor...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, if you would but tell me your thoughts on..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My thoughts vanish on contact!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto stared down at Moneo. How strange were the majordomo\u0027s eyes perched there above that hawkish Atreides nose-free-verse eyes in a metronome face. Did Moneo hear that rhythmic pulse-beat: Malky is coming! Malky is coming! Malky is coming!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo wanted to cry out in anguish. The thing he had felt- all gone! He put both his hands over his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your universe is a two-dimensional hourglass,\" Leto accused. \"Why do you try to hold back the sand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo lowered his hands and sighed. \"Do you wish to hear about the wedding arrangements, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be tiresome! Where is Hwi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fish Speakers are preparing her for...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you consulted her about the arrangements?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She approved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord, but she accused me of living for the quantity of activity and not for the quality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t she marvelous, Moneo? Does she see the unrest among the Fish Speakers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The idea of my marriage disturbs them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s why I sent the Duncan away, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is, and Siona with him to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, I know you have tested her and she...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She senses the Golden Path as deeply as you do, Moneo.\" \"Then why do I fear her, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you raise reason above all else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I do not know the reason for my fear!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto smiled. This was like playing bubble dice in an infinite bowl. Moneo\u0027s emotions were a marvelous play performed only on this stage. How near the edge he walked without ever seeing it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo, why do you insist on taking pieces out of the continuum?\" Leto asked. \"When you see a spectrum, do you desire one color there above all the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, I don\u0027t understand you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto closed his eyes, remembering the countless times he had heard this cry. The faces were an unseparated blend. He opened his eyes to erase them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-29.html","bookId":2156,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM"}
