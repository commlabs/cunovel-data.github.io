I would never hurt you on purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you did, anyway,” Kira says softly. “Just like you hurt Emma.” She turns to me. “And just like he’ll hurt you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tear escapes from my eye… and I’m crying for everything. For the pain in her voice, for the hopelessness of the situation, for the hurt that I see in Dom’s eyes. And for my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it’s broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now do you see?” Kira asks quietly. She hands me a tissue, and I wipe my eyes. I do see. I see with my own eyes what could happen to me, what Dominic has been trying to tell me all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell in love with him and all he can do is obliterate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only if I let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn’t be here. In this moment, I realize something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference between normal people and me is that I don’t make smart decisions for myself. I never know when to say when. I never know when to stop fighting for something, when to call it quits in order to protect my own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat ends today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in my life, I’m going to make a smart decision, no matter how hard it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pat Kira on the back, then walk out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey slips out of the bathroom before I can stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly, I follow her, winding my way through the crowded room, only to find no sign of her in the long hallway. I almost run through the house, through the people, until I’m standing in the middle of a mass of parked cars. I’m just in time to see Jacey drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I should let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m too selfish for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head for my car, and within a minute I’m on the road behind her. My Porsche catches up to her. I motion for her to pull over, but she doesn’t. I can see her crying; I can see the black streaks of mascara running down her cheeks. I motion again, but she refuses. She won’t even look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunning my engine, I pull in front of her, forcing her off the road. We’re in a secluded section of Sin’s neighborhood. She kills her engine and gets out of her car, glaring at me angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck are you doing, Dominic? I would have thought you’d figure out that if I left, then it means I’m done. But just in case, this is me saying no. No to you, no to your fucked-up life, no to doing anything else with you tonight. Got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words instill panic in me, and I don’t know why. All I know is that the thought of her driving away from me, leaving me… I can’t take it. Suddenly, the thought of it is crushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her arm. “No. I don’t accept that answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Jacey demands. It’s raining now. The rain hits her face and gleams under the streetlight. “You’ve always said that no means no. You don’t have many rules, but at least you have that one. You never wanted me, Dominic. You want a dead woman, and since you can’t have her, you wanted a game. I played it. And now I’m done with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls away and stomps toward her car, but I grab her again, whirling her around and pulling her to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a game. I meant it when I said I’m fucked up. But I mean it when I say that I don’t want it to be over, too. Whatever it is… you and I… whatever we’re doing. I don’t want it to be over, Jacey. I’m not ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me in astonishment, her gorgeous face shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you want me to hang around until you’re finally ready for it to be over? Until you’re done with me? You want me to end up like Kira… a sniveling wreck on the floor of a bathroom? No thanks, Dom. That’s not me. Not anymore. I’ve been a work in progress for quite a while, and I guess I can finally see that I deserve more than that. I’m worth more than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard, a thick lump in my throat, and I’m not sure why it’s there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kira isn’t my fault,” I tell her wildly. “I’ve told her from the beginning what I can offer her. And she wanted to be with me, anyway. She’s always known. She knows me, Jacey. She’s always known me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like I know you, Dom,” Jacey says in resignation. “This isn’t about Kira. This is about me and how I know that you’ll hurt me. I know that even though I don’t want to fall for you, I already have. I can’t make it worse now. I just can’t. I have to be strong enough to walk away. You’ve told me all along that you aren’t good for me. And guess what? You’re not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words cause my stomach to tie into a knot. I know I’m not good for her. I’m not good for anyone, but for her, for Jacey, I want to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I lose her, I don’t know what I’ll do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacey,” I continue, trying to make my voice steady, “I don’t know what I can offer you. But I’ll try to offer you something more than… this. I know you deserve more. Trust me, I know that. You’re different from everyone I know. You’re a breath of fresh air, and I just want to keep breathing you in. That’s a big thing for me, you have no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know what you can offer me?” she asks slowly, her brown eyes pained as she stares at me. “How about… yourself? Offer me yourself and I’ll stay. But I want all of you. I want a real relationship. I want you and your problems and the truth and the ugliness. I need to know all of it. Can you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of telling Jacey everything causes my heart to pound, and I see horrific images in my head. They blur together… Emma’s cold hands, her pale face, the blood. The lights from the ambulance. The blood. Her headstone. My guilt. The blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes for a minute, and behind my lids it’s red from the blood that I can’t stop seeing. I open them helplessly and I can’t say anything. I can’t get my tongue to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I can do is grab Jacey and pull her to me, forcing her lips to my own. Hers are soft and yielding, kissing me back for just a second until she pulls away. When she does, there are tears streaking down her face again, falling in black rivulets down her cheeks, mixing with the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think so,” she says softly when I don’t say anything. “Answer me one question, Dominic. And be honest. For once, please, just be completely, brutally honest.” She swallows hard, her hands clenched, and looks me in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you still in love with Emma? Yes or no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might as well have hit me with a Mack Truck. I stare at her, silent, trying to figure out how to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that simple,” I say helplessly. But she shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a yes or no answer, Dom. You taught me this game. Are you still in love with Emma? Yes or no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me, waiting. From the look in her eyes I can tell she’s wavering between wanting to know and being afraid to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes or no?” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI draw in a shaky breath. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath exhales in a feathery hiss and she shoves her hair out of her eyes with shaking fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The word yes has never hurt so much.” Her voice is a whisper, so soft I can barely hear it. I reach for her, but she shrugs away, out of my reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks away, her shoulders slumped as she gets into her car and drives off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand in the rain for what seems like forever, watching as her taillights disappear into the rain, and the night swallows up her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand there and let the rain run into my eyes until I can no longer see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil I can no longer see that she left me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get into my car, I’m empty inside, more empty and numb than I’ve been in years. Emptier than I’ve ever felt before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s only one place I can think of to go, one place that will absorb my pain. As I pass through the gates of Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery, the darkness surrounds me, and I feel a sense of comfort… of familiarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t been here in years, but I find Emma’s headstone easily. I go straight to it. It’s easy to see. Her parents bought an enormous white marble stone encircled by the wings of an angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneel in front of it and trace her name under my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma Brandt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was no angel, but I loved her anyway. Her stone is cold to the touch… as cold as ice, as cold as my heart. I think of Sin’s song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour heart is cold, cold as ice, but it’s mine to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is cold as ice. It will stay that way… because of Emma. I curl up in front of her name and lie with my cheek against the stone, staring into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrecked me. She might as well have me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not fit for anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a while, it starts to rain again, a light, cold rain that soaks into my clothes and lingers on my skin. I don’t even care, and honestly, I barely notice. It can’t wash away who I am, what I’ve done, or who I’ve been. I fall asleep listening to the rain falling on Emma’s stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I open my eyes again, it’s morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy clothes are wet and my throat is raspy since I breathed damp night air all night long. I sit up and look around, ignoring the odd looks from a cemetery worker. He goes back to weeding a flower bed, but still glances at me every now and then, probably wondering if I’m crazy. I should save him the trouble and just tell him that I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my phone and find ten messages from Tally. Because, fuck, I missed my flight home. I should be on-set right now. I sigh and climb back into my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seems like it’s falling apart and I don’t know how to stop it. This is the reason I’m carefully detached, always. I’m cool and calm and collected and I do the things I need to do. Always. I do it so that I don’t fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now there’s Jacey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd nothing is the same as it was before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t see through the tears streaming down my cheeks. They’re hot and salty and drip onto my clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up the phone and dial Maddy’s number, wanting to cry on her shoulder, to get her sage advice, but her voicemail picks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait, then try again a few minutes later, but still no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive aimlessly until I realize where I’m headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. Of course I’m headed for Brand. It’s what I always do when I need help or when I need comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I shouldn’t run to him anymore because he wants to comfort me in ways that I don’t want. He wants to be with me. For real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can’t think of anything but Dominic. My heart hurts in such a way that it’s almost blinding. It’s all I can feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull up out front of his condo building and almost sprint for his door. When I reach it, I’m out of breath, my makeup is smeared, and I’m a sniveling wreck. He answers the door, shirtless and in workout shorts, and stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell, Jacey?” he asks quickly, pulling me inside. “What happened? Are you all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, then shake my head, then drop onto his sofa and cry. He sits next to me awkwardly, patting my back with his giant hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what to do and I’ll do it,” he tells me helplessly. “Did he hurt you? I’ll fucking kick his teeth in if he did.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-we-fall-beautifully-broken-3/page-37.html","bookId":2761,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM"}
