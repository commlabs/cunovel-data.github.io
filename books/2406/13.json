She dropped to the ground and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is he?” Kat asked as she bolted down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re almost to the Thames.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay with him, Nick,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. He’s not going anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hamish? Angus?” Kat asked. “Help Nick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On it, Kitty,” Hamish answered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat heard a roar behind her and turned just in time to see Gabrielle on a motorcycle, speeding her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle pulled to the side of the street and yelled, “Get on!” but Kat wasn’t waiting for an invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think this might be my first high-speed chase,” Simon said from the sidecar. Gabrielle banked hard, careening around a curve. “I’m not sure I like it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nick, where is he?” Kat asked, but was met with only silence. Gabrielle revved the bike and Kat asked again, “Nick? Angus? Hamish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our comms units are running out of a van in the Henley parking lot,” Simon said. “We must be out of range.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they neared the Tower of London, the traffic began to congest and clog, tour buses and red double-deckers merging with black cabs and service vans, all full of people trying to fight their way across the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was only one face that mattered, so Kat put her hands on Gabrielle’s shoulders and stood, scanning the crowds that filled the busy street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat.” Nick’s voice came through her earpiece. It was scratchy and garbled and Kat only made out one word. “…bridge…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all she needed to hear. In a flash, Kat was off the bike and running past the House of Parliament, through the shadow of Big Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat, what do you want us to do?” Nick finally said, his voice clear. “Kat, do you want us to approach him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see Nick near the Bagshaws fifty feet away from Garrett on the opposite side of the street. They stood shielded by the traffic and pedestrians, lingering with the vendors and artists who gathered, hocking their wares to the tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one man wasn’t there for the sights. Kat was on the bridge, pushing through the crowds, when she saw him stop at the rail and reach into his pocket. A second later, the papers were in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat?” Nick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop him,” Kat said, but the static must have come again, they were so far from Simon’s base at the Henley. “Stop him!” she shouted, but it was too late. The boys couldn’t see when the man pulled a lighter from his pocket. No one noticed a thing until flames began to lick at the corners of the pages, and soon they were alive with fire, crumbling into black and falling into the Thames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatarina Bishop was not a girl unaccustomed to setbacks. She’d been born into a world of Plan A, B, C, and at the very least, D. She knew things never went exactly according to plan, but never before had she been so clueless about what could or should come next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could call Eddie and ask for advice, but Eddie had a strict “Do Not Disturb Unless Someone Is Bleeding” policy. She could go to her father, but she wasn’t exactly sure where he was or if he’d forgive her when he found out she’d had the complete blueprints to the Henley and had only tried to steal a stack of papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick and his blueprints were on a flight back to Brussels and his mom and his school. He’d done all he could to help, and now the only thing Kat knew for certain was that Hale’s world was different from hers. They spoke a different language, played by different rules. So as she walked into Carlos’s apartment an hour later, Kat couldn’t shake the feeling that the only person who could help was the only person she absolutely couldn’t call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a ray of light came slicing through the dark. Literally. Kat threw her hands up to shield against it, and Angus and Hamish bolted toward the outline of a man in a chair. They were almost there when Gabrielle reached for the switch on the wall and the kitchen lights flickered on, freezing Kat and her crew where they stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dropped this.” Hale turned off the flashlight that Kat had last seen skidding across the Henley’s concrete floor. “Thought you might want it back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” she said. “It’s my favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’d you find us?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I met this girl once.… She taught me all kinds of useful things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She sounds like a keeper,” Kat said, but this time Hale made no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he stood and examined the large room. “So, this is a nice place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It belongs to Carlos,” Angus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carlos is Cuban,” Hamish finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for him,” Hale said. And then he stopped. There were four other people in the room, but Hale only looked at Kat, and something in his gaze burned her, froze her, made her want to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can explain,” she blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you can. But I don’t want an explanation, Katarina. I’d rather have the truth.” The playful smile was gone. The spark in his eyes was extinguished. There was nothing but cold fury that stared back at her when he asked, “Why are you in London, Kat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried to tell you, Hale, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a slow step closer. “Why are you in London?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s probably nothing. And I didn’t want to worry you until we knew something for sure, so—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why. Are. You. In. London?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hale…” Kat reached for his hand, but he pulled away. He couldn’t touch her. “We came to get something out of your grandmother’s desk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We think…we heard that she might have had a different will. And we came to see for ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s ridiculous.” Hale shook his head. “Why would you think such a thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, from the corner of Kat’s eye, she saw Marcus. He stood stoically at attention as always, but right then he made a subtle shift. He opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say a word, Kat said, “Uncle Eddie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about him?” Hale asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He heard the will was a fake,” Gabrielle said. “A really good con.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So Uncle Eddie heard that my grandmother’s will was a fake?” Hale asked. “But you don’t come to me. You don’t say a thing to me because… Why didn’t you say anything, Kat? Why would you…” Then Hale’s voice trailed off. He glanced toward the window with its views of the Tower and Buckingham Palace—places of power, family. Deceit. And his voice was cold when he said, “I’m not really the heir, am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the lies Kat had told in her life, not one was harder than the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. But something’s wrong, Hale. We don’t know what, exactly, but your grandmother did leave some papers in that desk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHale spun on her. “What did they say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat hung her head. “Garrett got to them before I did. They’re gone, Hale. I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did they say?” he asked, his voice cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t know,” Gabrielle said. But Hale just kept looking at Kat. “Sure you do. Don’t you, Kat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It might have been a will. I don’t know, though. Like I said, Garrett got to the papers first. And then he destroyed them. They’re gone, Hale. I’m sorry. I’m so—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you think Garrett’s behind all of this? So he can…what? What’s his endgame? What does he want?” Hale sounded very much like someone trying to look at things objectively. As though it were just another job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat shrugged. “We don’t have a clue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know who might have been able to help with that?” Hale shouted. “Me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hale,” Kat said, reaching for him; but he pulled away. “I wanted to tell you, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what, Kat? But I couldn’t be trusted? But I’m too immature to keep a secret? Maybe you think I’m a screw-up, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw him destroy those papers, Hale,” Kat countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Exactly. Papers. They could have been anything. This proves nothing.” He stormed toward the door, then stopped short. “No. Wait. It proves I don’t have a girlfriend anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep every chance you get. Eat every chance you get. These were two of many lessons that Kat had learned at her father’s knee and her uncle’s table, but on the long flight over the Atlantic, she couldn’t manage to doze. She wanted to blame it on her coach-class ticket, but every time she closed her eyes, she heard Hale’s words and the slamming door. It felt like a dream on a constant loop inside her head, and as much as she wanted to press pause, it just kept playing over and over, and the scene never changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot on the walk through the airport. Not during the long ride in the back of the cab. Even standing on Uncle Eddie’s stoop, Kat still saw the look on Hale’s face, and for once she had absolutely no idea how to steal the thing she really wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry,” Gabrielle said. “He’ll get over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat put her key in the lock and looked out over the sleepy street. Newspapers lay waiting for owners; the bakery on the corner had hot bagels and warm coffee. Gabrielle gave a full-body stretch and never once complained about the discomfort of the flight. There are some things even worse than flying coach internationally, and Gab knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll come around,” she said. “Trust me, boys always come around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn’t it, so Kat shifted. “I’m not worried. I’m scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hale will be fine. He’s just got to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not about Hale. Garrett. There was this moment in London… It was like…” She trailed off, unable to say the words aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was almost like he knew I was there. Or he was expecting me to be there or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re getting paranoid in your old age,” Gabrielle teased, but Kat didn’t think it was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember what Marianne said? About Garrett?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean how she was surprised that Hazel never got around to firing him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, looks like that’s not exactly correct.” Kat handed Gabrielle the piece of carbon paper that she had found in the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old is this?” Gabrielle asked with a laugh, but then her eyes scanned over the copy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hazel typed that letter four days before her coma—two days before she arrived in New York.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle stopped reading. “So Hazel was old-fashioned? What does that…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Read the first line. Right there.” Kat pointed to the words. “It’s a termination letter. Hazel did fire Garrett. And five days later, she died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Kat nor Gabrielle mentioned those facts again as they let themselves into their uncle’s house and made their way toward the kitchen. They didn’t reach for a light. They didn’t have to. Even without their particular skill sets, the walk was one they both knew well. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-13.html","bookId":2406,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM"}
