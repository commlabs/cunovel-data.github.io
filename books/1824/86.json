They stopped in front of a single-story dilapidated house with a battered and faded FOR SALE sign in the front yard. It was partially obscured by trash and weeds. The place looked deserted. Liam put the car in park and Allison stared past him, trying to see if there was movement in one of the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liam, I have something to tell you, and I\u0027d like you to try to be reasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reasonable about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a breath and, knowing he was about to be extremely unreasonable, said, \"This is a house where one of Will\u0027s friends lived. Will could be inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could explain her plan, he said, \"He isn\u0027t. Agents checked for me. Went through the house, room by room. It\u0027s empty, and no one\u0027s been there for a long time. See? I can be reasonable.\" He smiled after making the statement of fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The names were on your screen, and I checked them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It was a long shot. Will knew them years ago when he was in high school. I remembered them because they were really mean, and they scared me. They were the kind of guys who would easily become violent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you hoping to accomplish here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought one of them might be hiding Will. If I can find him and get him to surrender peacefully, Phillips assured me the court would take that into consideration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis patience was quickly vanishing. \"Are you still hell-bent on helping him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want him to die in a hail of bullets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hail of bullets? You watch too much television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he has the opportunity to surrender, then that\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping he\u0027ll want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her for a long, silent moment and then said, \"Do you know anywhere else he could be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. She was emphatic. \"And if I did know, I would tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConvinced, he nodded. \"Okay, then. Is our scenic drive over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She thought he looked relieved. \"I\u0027m beginning to get the feeling you can\u0027t wait to get rid of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, but she noticed he didn\u0027t contradict her. They didn\u0027t talk much on the way back to her apartment, each lost in thought. She was dying to ask him where he was going or if he would be back, and her determination not to was making her crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis farewell didn\u0027t warm her heart. He grabbed her, gave her a quick kiss, and said, \"See you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to hit something. She finally understood what Liam had meant when he said frustration and pressure built up. Hitting was a good release, he\u0027d told her. She was about to find out for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called Dan. An hour later she was being destroyed on a racquetball court at the gym. The only time she hit the ball was during practice before they started a game. Dan was proud-and loud-announcing to anyone who would listen that he had wiped the floor with her. He couldn\u0027t just say he\u0027d won?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though she had been humiliated on the court with at least twenty men watching, after all was said and done, she did feel better. Liam had been right. Hitting something-or in her case, trying to hit something-helped get rid of tension and stress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan, still gloating from his victory, walked her to her car. \"Have you been aware of your surroundings?\" he asked, now reverting to his brother mode.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know you\u0027re being followed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do know. He\u0027s an agent temporarily assigned to watch over me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked, his concern obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to go into a lengthy explanation about Will or even the trouble over Bale\u0027s resentment, so she simply said, \"I\u0027m an asset as long as I work at the cyber unit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, accepting her half-given explanation. \"Where\u0027s the guy you\u0027re usually with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to see him again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" She sounded disheartened and knew he noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan opened her car door for her. \"You fell for him, didn\u0027t you?\" Her silence told him everything he needed to know. As pragmatic as ever, he said, \"Maybe it\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re going to California pretty soon. A new start,\" he suggested. \"I personally wish you weren\u0027t going, but I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe interrupted. \"I\u0027m not going. I want to start my company here in Boston. I can take on the Silicon boys from here.\" She smiled as she added, \"And annihilate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan couldn\u0027t have been happier and wanted to celebrate. \"What are you doing tonight?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-86.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
