No, you need a blessing, or personal intervention, and this is as true of a mortal as it is of an Elder God. That ship is Jaghut – its kind has not sailed the seas of this world for millennia. Where has it come from?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘From the realm of Omtose Phellack itself,’ said the sorceress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, that is not possible. Unless a Jaghut has journeyed into the warren – but no, there is naught but ice – yonder ship was built in this world. Do you see now why this makes no sense?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not just ice, apparently.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have seen Omtose Phellack?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My handmaid,’ said the sorceress. ‘It was she who journeyed through the gate. It was she who entered Omtose Phellack and returned with the ship.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquity studied the woman with the bruised eyes. ‘Describe the place where you were, please.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enlighten her,’ ordered the sorceress when the handmaid hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrug, and then, ‘Forest. Demons. Ravines. Vicious apes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You did not journey to Omtose Phellack,’ Equity pronounced. ‘The gate opened upon another realm, a different warren.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That cannot be,’ objected the sorceress. ‘My ritual fed on the power of Omtose Phellack.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enough of all this,’ drawled the captain, crossing her arms. ‘This Forkrul Assail has come here to negotiate. She seeks to betray her Elders. Obviously, she’s come looking for allies, though why she would seek us out remains something of a mystery, since she clearly knew nothing about your making use of Omtose Phellack, Princess. So, unless your skills in sorcery are such that even the gods tremble, I admit to having some trouble understanding what she wants from us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquity sighed. ‘We felt the touch of an Elder Warren, but could not determine which one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then it was the Elder Pures who dispatched you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, those who remain close to the Spire are mostly blind to distant powers. When I spoke of “we” I meant myself and my comrades; we have journeyed many times well beyond the influence of the power emanating from the Spire, else we would not have detected these … intrusions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And now you want to forge some kind of alliance,’ said the captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You seek the Spire, and that which lies upon its altar—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not precisely,’ interjected the sorceress, pausing to pull hard on her pipe before adding, ‘we seek to prevent whatever it is you’re all planning.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And how do you expect to do that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I believe the term you have already used will suffice: allies.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you – and your allies – would have any hope of succeeding, you will need our help.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if we do not trust you?’ the captain asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This is proving a waste of time,’ said Equity. ‘I will speak to the Jaghut now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There isn’t one,’ said the sorceress, behind a veil of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then he or she is hiding even from you. Open the gate, Princess – the one you used for your servant. The presence is very close – I can feel it. I felt it when you unleashed Omtose Phellack against me. Open the gate, and let us all see who has come among us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHissing, the sorceress held out her pipe. The handmaid took it. ‘Very well. It will be a feeble gate; indeed, I might well fail—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It won’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sorceress walked a short distance away, her rounded hips swaying. She lifted her hands, fingers moving as if plucking invisible strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitter cold flooded out, the sand crackling as if lit by lightning, and the gate that erupted was massive, yawning, towering. Through the billowing icy air flowed out a sweeter, rank smell. The smell of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure stood on the threshold of the gate. Tall, hunched, a withered, lifeless face of greenish grey, yellowed tusks thrusting up from the lower jaw. Pitted eyes regarded them from beneath a tattered woollen cowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power cascading from this apparition sent Equity stumbling back. Abyss! A Jaghut, yes, but not just any Jaghut! Calm – can you hear me? Through this howl? Can you hear me? An ally stands before me – an ally of ancient – so ancient – power! This one could have been an Elder God. This one could have been … anything! Gasping, fighting to keep from falling to one knee, from bowing before this terrible creature, Equity forced herself to lift her gaze, to meet the empty hollows of his eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-130.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
