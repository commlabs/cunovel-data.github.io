A face very unlike mine. Of my mother’s three children, only Christopher resembled his father more than he did our mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis acrimony had the predictable effect of making me want to bait him. “The pleasure of hearing your voice. What else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cut the shit, Gideon. Did you call to gloat? Your fondest wish has finally come true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back in my chair, I looked up at the ceiling. “I’d tell you I’m very sorry your parents are divorcing, but you wouldn’t believe me, so I won’t bother. Instead, I’ll say that I’m here for you, if you need me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go to hell.” He hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the receiver away from my ear and held it aloft a moment. Contrary to Christopher’s belief, I hadn’t always disliked him. There had been a time when I welcomed him in my life. For a short time, I’d had a comrade. A brother. The animosity I felt now, he’d earned. But no matter, I would take care of him and see that he didn’t stumble too badly, whether he liked it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning the handset to its cradle, I got back to work. After all, I couldn’t have anything pressing over the weekend. I planned to be completely incommunicado while with my wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied Dr. Petersen, who sat completely at ease across from me. He wore dark, loose jeans with a tucked-in white shirt, as comfortable as I’d ever seen him. I wondered if that was a deliberate decision in an effort to seem as innocuous as possible. He knew my history with therapists now, understood why I would always find them threatening to some degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did your weekend in Westport go?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did she call you?” In the past, when Eva wanted to make sure I discussed something in therapy, she would bring it up to Dr. Petersen in advance. I grumbled about it and often didn’t appreciate it, but her motivation was her love for me and I couldn’t bitch about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” He smiled, and it was gentle, almost fond. “I saw the photographs of you and Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat surprised me. “I wouldn’t have taken you for the type to follow the tabloids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My wife does. She showed me the pictures because she found them very romantic. I have to agree with her. You both looked very happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you get along with Eva’s family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled back, draping my arm over the armrest. “I’ve known Richard Stanton for many years and Monica for the last few.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Casual and business acquaintances are very different from in-laws.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis perceptiveness rankled. Still, I was honest. “It was … awkward. Unnecessarily so, but I dealt with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Petersen’s smile widened. “How did you deal with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I focused on Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you maintained distance from the others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No more than usual.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scribbled notes into his tablet. “Anything else happen since I saw you on Thursday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth twisted wryly. “She bought me a dog. A puppy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at me. “Congratulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “Eva’s tickled by the whole thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it her dog, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. She got all the gear and dropped him in my lap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s quite a commitment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be fine. Animals are good at self-sufficiency.” Because he waited with expectant patience, I moved on. “My stepfather filed for divorce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Petersen’s head tilted a little as he studied me. “We’ve gone from in-laws, to a new dog, to the dissolution of your parents’ marriage in the space of a few minutes. That’s a tremendous amount of change for someone who strives for structure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was stating the obvious, so I didn’t add anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seem remarkably composed, Gideon. Because things are going well with Eva?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exceptionally well.” I knew the contrast to last week’s therapy session was striking. I’d been wild with panic over the separation from Eva, terrified and frantic that I might lose her. I could recall the feelings with anguished clarity, but I had difficulty accepting how quickly I had … unraveled. I didn’t recognize that desperate man, couldn’t reconcile him with what I knew about myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly. “Of the three things you mentioned, how would you rank them from most important to least important?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-56.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
