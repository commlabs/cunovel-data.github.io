Aunt Sophie and a kindly neighbor mended and stitched and washed and ironed and packed, to get Dolly ready for her journey next day and the outdoor months to follow. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile the little maid for whom they labored slept quietly in the adjoining room, all unknowing of the delights in store for her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning at eight o’clock a little procession waited in front of the Children’s House of Joy, making ready for its start on the long journey to Overlook Mountain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the head stood Colonel Gresham’s seven-passenger car, in charge of John, the Colonel’s chauffeur. Next came No. 45678; then Russell Ely, who had placed himself and his car at Polly’s disposal; while Colonel Gresham’s small truck, piled with all manner of luggage, tagged the three. The children were chattering and snickering as only little people can. There were last words to say, last bundles to dispose of, and all was hilarity and happiness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [101] “Now, father,” said Polly, “remember that you have promised to come up in August for a few days at the least, and you must plan to make it a week if you possibly can. You owe it to yourself and to your patients. I do wish you and mother could come together.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She looked appealingly into Mrs. Dudley’s eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her mother smilingly shook her head. “I’ll try to come,” she said, “and I’ll do my very best to make your father keep his promise; but I’m afraid we can’t come at the same time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When are we goin’?” piped up Timmy, flinging the query in Polly’s direction.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As soon as I can make this box stay where it belongs,” she laughed. “There! I believe that’s positively the last.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her eyes scanned the running-board, the walk, even the roadway. Was everything in? She paused, thinking.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t try to find a single package more,” laughed Lilith. “If we don’t start pretty soon—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh!

In a moment the two runaways reappeared in the doorway, Russell carrying Polly’s forgotten lunch basket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This made the grown folks laugh. Then everybody[102] said good-bye. There was a waving of hands, the cars burr-r-ed and sizzed and smoked; there were more good-byes and hand-wavings—and they were on the long way to Overlook.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Reaching Prattsboro Polly Dudley’s car whirled ahead of the procession and speeded around to the little gray house.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dolly Merrifield was at the window, ready from hat to shoe, and even more radiant than usual.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I never was so taken back in my life,” declared Aunt Sophie, looking up from the suitcase she was strapping. “I got a letter from Sardis just now, telling why he didn’t answer mine. He hadn’t got it! And to think your father should take the trouble to write! Well, if he hadn’t, Dolly could not have gone—that’s all. I’m mighty glad he did, and we all are. Why, Sardis says he went to the post-office and there wasn’t any letter from me. You see, it got mixed up with somebody else’s mail, and he hadn’t got it even then; but he’d heard about it, though. Such doings!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “According to Sardis, anything your father says, goes. I didn’t know he knew him; but it seems he’d heard all about him—when he was down at Yale, I guess. He says he wouldn’t have Dolly miss it for anything. Dear me, this string ain’t long enough! I’ll have to tie a piece on. Thank you. Guess my fingers are nervous. There, that’s all! My! all those autos going? Won’t you have a splendid time! How far’d you say it was?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [103] “About a hundred and forty miles.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My!” ejaculated Mrs. Edmonson again. “Well, you’ve got a lovely day. You’ll let me know how Dolly stood it, won’t you?” she asked a bit anxiously as she followed the others to the sidewalk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ll send you word right away,” Polly reassured her. “Father says she’ll get along all right, and we have a doctor right here, if we should need anything. And a nurse, too,” she laughed. “They are going to be with us all summer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, they are!” exclaimed Aunt Sophie in a relieved tone. “I shall feel easier about her, then.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They had reached Polly’s car, and Russell put the little girl on the front seat, between the driver and Lilith.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aunt Sophie stepped upon the running-board and kissed Dolly again, and then backed out to make way for Polly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ll write to you, Aunt Sophie,” promised Dolly. “Don’t work too hard! And don’t forget to take a nap before you do the dishes, ’cause you were up all night!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That was a wonderful ride to most of the passengers. It was just warm enough to be comfortable, with a fresh breeze—exactly such a morning as Polly would have chosen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Tired, dear?” she questioned, smiling down into the little face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [104] “Not a bit,” Dolly smiled back. “Isn’t it splendid! Aren’t you glad Sardis said yes? I wonder if he ever had such a nice ride.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I guess so,” laughed Polly; and then, “Have you thought, dear, you will be nearer your brother than when you were at home?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dolly’s little thin face grew pink, “O—h!” she said softly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know just where your brother is. I must look it up. He may be right across the New Hampshire line.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is away up in the northern part.” The pink faded. “Never mind, we shall be nearer than when I was down in Prattsboro.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The child wagged her head delightedly, while Polly wondered what kind of brother this was to hold such a place in his little sister’s heart. If he were all that Dolly believed him to be, she should like to know him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The wind died and the air grew warm.

Where is the lunch basket?” Lilith peered down over the back of her seat. “I believe you hid it away!

I foresee what lonesome days I am going to have up on the mountain.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dolly was looking at the girl with a puzzled expression.

Dr. Abbe was not far behind, and the three returned with more cones, running back and forth until all were supplied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a happy thought of Lilith’s, for the children were in ecstasies, and the icy sweets were grateful to everybody. Dr. Abbe and Russell lingered by Polly’s car, the children on the back seat eating and chattering by turns. Suddenly Little Duke’s voice piped high above the others’.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh! it’s awful hot; but My hasn’t sweat a hair!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Those on the front seat laughed slyly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Pretty good,” observed Russell softly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [107] “Amusing little fellow,” returned Dr. Abbe in the same tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Polly glanced behind. Little Duke, all unconscious of the notice, was engaged in examining his suit of new tan linen which was his especial admiration. Finding it still immaculate, he resumed his ice-cream, remarking, “If My should get a drop on this, it would be enough to drive the angels to drink.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Russell grinned, Dr. Abbe’s lips puckered, Lilith laughed into her handkerchief, while Polly whirled her back towards the small boy, and chuckled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You seem to be in a fair way to have plenty of entertainment,” observed Russell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This goes a little ahead of our regular everyday kind,” returned Polly; “but there’s always enough to keep us cheerful.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is well we didn’t wait for a woodsy dining-room,” declared Polly, when they were again racing northward. “It doesn’t look as if we’d find one very soon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It grew hotter and hotter.
