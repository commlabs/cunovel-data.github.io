No one had seen her or heard from her, although everyone pledged to do all they could to help me find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also made another call, to an investigator who had a reputation for tracking down the missing, and as I pulled up to my sister\u0027s house in Fullerton, a nondescript Camry was pulling up just behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinoza was a small man with a heavy aura. Not a dark aura. Just heavy. Something was eating away at him, making his life a living hell. I didn\u0027t need to be psychic to know that he\u0027d lost something important to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinoza parked on the street behind me and got out. He was a small man. The complete opposite of Kingsley or the beast, Knighthorse. And as Spinoza came toward me, concern creasing his pleasantly handsome face, I suddenly had a whiff of something that made me nearly vomit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of burned flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Jesus, I thought, as I saw in my mind\u0027s eye a burned hand and twisted metal and broken glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis son\u0027s hand. There had been an accident. Mixed with the smell of burnt flesh was alcohol. Spinoza, I was suddenly certain, had been driving. Drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Jesus, I thought again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinoza took my hand and as he did so, the psychic vision and smell of burning flesh disappeared. He next gave me a small, awkward hug. The look in his eyes was one of only concern. I suddenly suspected why Spinoza was known for finding the missing, especially missing children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you holding up?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been better. Thanks for coming out on short notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"We\u0027ll find her, Sam. Don\u0027t worry.\" And his quiet strength and assuredness spoke volumes. It also calmed me down. Somewhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led the way into my sister\u0027s house, where Detective Sherbet of the Fullerton Police Department was already inside. No, I wasn\u0027t too concerned that a homicide investigator was there since I had called him, too. Detective Sherbet had become a good friend. So good, in fact, that he and I now shared a deepening telepathic link. Granted, the good detective wasn\u0027t exactly thrilled by our telepathic link, but he seemed to be getting the hang of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll find her, Sam, he thought, nodding, his words appearing softly just inside my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, Detective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou came over next with tears in her eyes, looking so distraught that I was the one doing the reassuring. \"Not your fault,\" I said over and over as she completely broke down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she\u0027d gotten control of herself, I planned our course of action with the detectives. At ten years old, Tammy would have fewer choices available to her. She couldn\u0027t drive and she didn\u0027t have a lot of money. She wasn\u0027t addicted to drugs and didn\u0027t have a boyfriend. At least, as far as I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth was, I had a hard time getting a psychic handle on my own kids. I could read their auras, but that was about it. It was the same with my sister and with her kids; and the same with my parents, although these days I didn\u0027t see them very often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou had confirmed that some toiletries were missing, along with her gym bag. We even confirmed that a jar of peanut butter and some saltines were gone, too. Tammy\u0027s favorite snack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, a child walking the streets alone with a gym bag was trouble, and it was all I could do to stay calm. Running outside and screaming for my baby wouldn\u0027t help anything, although that\u0027s exactly what I felt like doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy, Sam, came Sherbet\u0027s words. A child walking around with a gym bag would just as easily get the attention of police. And I have my best men out there looking for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have a cell phone?\" Spinoza asked. We were grouped around Mary Lou\u0027s living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s off,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinoza and Sherbet winced. We all knew that a phone had to be on to be used as a tracking device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laptop or tablet computer?\" pressed Spinoza. \"Anything with GPS?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she know anyone with a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d better not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have access to a bike? Anything she can move quickly on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bikes are at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinoza glanced over at my sister. \"And all bikes are accounted for here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Bikes and skateboards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was having a hard time concentrating, focusing, and remembering what I should do in an investigation like this. But it\u0027s not an investigation, I thought. It\u0027s my daughter - and she\u0027s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherbet glanced at me again and then looked over at my sister. \"Do you have any recent pictures of Tammy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, yes. On my cell phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you print me out a half dozen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded eagerly and dashed off to where I knew her husband had his own office at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was gone, we finalized our plan. Sherbet would work with the local beat cops and cruise the streets in a coordinated effort. Spinoza would hit every Starbucks, fast-food restaurant and store within two square miles. I would contact all her friends and head straight to all her known hangouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou came back with the color photos. Seeing her photo, with her happy, smiling face made me almost lose it right there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy, Sam, came Sherbet\u0027s soothing voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective next instructed Mary Lou to email the same image to his department. An APB had already been sent to all units with a description of my daughter, including her current, assumed clothing. Now they would have a corresponding photo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s real, I thought, listening to Sherbet instruct his department. She\u0027s really missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought to control my breathing. To control myself. Finally, Sherbet clicked off his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all we can do on this end,\" said Sherbet, turning to us. \"Let\u0027s hit the streets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-14.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
