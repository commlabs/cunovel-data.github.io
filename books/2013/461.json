Was this how she wanted to announce her conquest? Would the damned fools leave anything still breathing in that palace?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what of this un-killable Emperor? Lostara Yil did not believe such a thing was even possible. A cusser in the bastard’s crotch there on that throne and he’ll be giving to the people for days and days. She wouldn’t put it past Fiddler, either. One step into the throne room, the thwock of that oversized crossbow, and then the sergeant diving back, trying to get clear as the entire room erupted. He’d probably happily kill himself for that pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, while without doubt the Adjunct shared such visions, Tavore said nothing. Nor did she urge her troops to any haste-not that any of them were in shape for that, especially the marines. Instead, they advanced at a measured pace, and citizens began appearing from the side lanes, alleys and avenues, to watch them march past. Some even cried out a welcome, with voices breaking with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city was a mess. Riots and earthquakes and Moranth munitions. Lostara Yil began to realize that, if the arrival of the Bonehunters signified anything, it was the promise of a return to order, a new settling of civilization, of laws and, ironically, of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Adjunct, if we tarry here too long, that will turn. It always does. Nobody likes being under an occupier’s heel. Simple human nature, to take one’s own despair and give it a foreigner’s face, then let loose the hounds of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee these citizens? These bright, gladdened faces? Any one of them, before long, could turn. The reapers of violence can hide behind the calmest eyes, the gentlest of smiles. ‘\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe column’s pace was slowing, with ever more crowds before them. Chants were rising and falling here and there. Letherii words, the tone somewhere between hope and insistence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct, what is it they’re all saying?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA name,’ she replied. ‘Well, two names, I think. One they call the Saviour. The other…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The other… what, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast Lostara a quick glance, then her mouth set, before she said, ‘Emperor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmperor? ‘But I thought-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new Emperor, Captain. By proclamation, it would seem.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and have we nothing to say on this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly ahead was a wall of citizens, blocking all hopes ‘ of passage, through which a small group was moving, pushing its way to the forefront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct raised a gloved hand to signal a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. ‘ ¦ ¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group emerged, an enormously fat woman in the lead, followed by a gnarled little man who seemed to be carrying rats in the pockets of his cloak, and then two men who looked like brothers. Both lean, one in the uniform of an officer, the other wearing a tattered, blood-stained blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore dismounted, gesturing for Lostara to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women approached the group. As they drew closer, the fat woman stepped to one side and with a surprisingly elegant wave of one plump hand she said, ‘Commander, I present to you Brys Beddict, once Champion to King Ezgara Diskanar-before the Edur conquest-now proclaimed the Saviour. And his brother, Tehol Beddict, financial genius, liberator of the oppressed and not half bad in bed, even now being proclaimed the new Emperor of Lether by his loving subjects.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct seemed at a loss for a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara stared at this Tehol Beddict-although, truth be told, she’d rather let her eyes linger on Brys-and frowned at the disgusting blanket wrapped about him. Financial genius?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys Beddict now stepped forward and, as had the huge woman, spoke in the trader’s tongue. ‘We would escort you to the Eternal Domicile, Commander, where we will, I believe, find an emperor without an empire, who will need to be ousted.’ He hesitated, then added, ‘I assume you come as liberators, Commander. And, accordingly, have no wish to overstay your welcome.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By that,’ the Adjunct said, ‘you mean to imply that I have insufficient forces to impose a viable occupation. Were you aware, Brys Beddict, that your eastern borderlands have been overrun? And that an army of allies now marches into your empire?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you come as conquerors, then?’ Brys Beddict asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct sighed, then unstrapped and pulled off her helm. She drew her hand from its glove and ran it through her short, sweat-damp hair. ‘Hood forbid,’ she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Find us a way through these people, then, Brys Beddict.’ She paused, cast her gaze to Tehol Beddict, and slowly frowned. ‘You are rather shy for an emperor,’ she observed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-461.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
