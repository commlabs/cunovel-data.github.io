I heard you made friends with Cam Compton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere in San Antonio,\" I said, \"there\u0027s a big and tall store with a bronze plaque inscribed to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo frowned and looked down at his outfit—rayon camp shirt, black slacks, oxblood deck shoes that made mine look like poor country cousins. His braided gold neck chain would\u0027ve hunchbacked a lesser human being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to get all your clothes custommade,\" he said, \"you might as well get them made nice. Some of us can\u0027t just throw on yesterday\u0027s jeans and Tshirt, Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked my Triple Rock Tshirt for stains. \"I have two of these. What was the crisis that came up last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda kept singing. She opened her eyes every once in a while to glance up nervously at the control booth, like she knew how she was sounding. She looked like she was singing her heart out—taking huge breaths from her diaphragm, scrunching up her face with effort when she belted out the words, but none of the energy of the night before was coming through the speakers. The first engineer tilted his head a little more and said, \"I told you she was miked wrong. You and your damn V87s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vice principal grunted. The second engineer tapped at the computer monitor a little more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo pointed left with his thumb. We moved a few steps toward the door? just out of earshot from the studio guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me you\u0027ve decided to help us out,\" he insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened with you last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratched the corner of his mouth, found some invisible particle that displeased him, rolled it in his fingers and flicked it away. \"I had a great day. I called around, gently explaining to people that maybe I wasn\u0027t exactly sure where Les is. Several major clients bailed. The cops were thrilled. They were about as excited as I thought they\u0027d be. As soon as they get through yawning I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll launch a massive manhunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo glared at me accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honesty is next to godliness,\" I consoled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I got a call from our accountant. Not good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How not good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two engineers were arguing now about the isolation qualities of wide compression mikes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have to sing with the guitar?\" the monitor tapper pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vice principal shrugged, keeping his eyes sternly on the imaginary detention hall below him. \"Lady said she felt more comfortable that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other engineer grumbled. \"Does she sound like she\u0027s comfortable? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo kept staring forward. \"Apparently Les hasn\u0027t been telling me everything. Some of the commission checks haven\u0027t been going into the main account. A few days ago one of our checks for some equipment rentals bounced. There are also some creditors I didn\u0027t know about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad enough. The agency costs fifteen thousand a month to run. That\u0027s barebones—phone bills, transportation, property, promo expenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much longer can you keep afloat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo laughed with no humour. \"I can keep the creditors at bay for a while. I don\u0027t know how long. Fortunately our clients pay us? we don\u0027t pay them. So they don\u0027t have to find out right away. But by all rights the agency should\u0027ve folded at the start of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLes had made arrangements to pay our bills then and there\u0027s no way he could have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the time he disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo shook his head. \"You had to put it that way, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda strained her way through another verse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" one of the engineers was saying, \"it\u0027s a Roland VS880, okay? Pickup isn\u0027t the problem here. You don\u0027t need the goddamn digital delay if she\u0027s singing it right, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady\u0027s a cold fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just try it,\" the vice principal insisted. \"Put a little through her headphone mix, see if that warms her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I told Milo about my last two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo stared at me while I talked. When I finished he seemed to do a mental countdown, then looked out the Plexiglas again and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like any of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said Les joked about running off to Mexico. If this plan he had to get Sheckly was dangerous, if it went bad—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stowing away funds from the agency, pulling deceased identities from personnel files—what does that sound like to you, Berkeley Law? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo brought his palms up to his temples. \"No way. That\u0027s not—Les couldn\u0027t do that. It\u0027s not his style to run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo\u0027s tone warned me not to push it. I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back down at Miranda, who was just finishing the last chorus. \"How bad will all this affect her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo kept his eyes closed. \"Maybe it can still work. Silo\u0027s been paid through next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCentury Records will need some heavy reassurances, but they\u0027ll wait for the tape. If we get a good one to them on time, if we get Sheckly off our backs ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda finished her song. The sound died the instant she stopped belting it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody said anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the engineer asked halfheartedly, \"Do another take? We could try to feed her just the basic tracks. Move the baffles around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda was looking up at us. The vice principal shook his head. \"Take a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he leaned over the console and pushed a button. \"Miranda, honey, take a break for a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda\u0027s shoulders fell slightly. She nodded, then started slowly toward the exit with her guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo watched her go out the black curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to talk to her,\" he mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, first door on the left. I\u0027d have to be positive with her. Right now that\u0027s not possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and concentrated on the recording console like he was wondering how hard it would be to lift and throw through the Plexiglas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda was lying on a cot with her forearms over her face and her knees up. She peeped out briefly when I wrapped my knuckles on the open door, then covered her eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came in and set my backpack on the little round table next to her. I took out my bag of Texas French Bread pastries and a .22 Montgomery Ward pistol. Miranda opened her eyes when the gun clunked on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you could use some breakfast,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. When she spoke she exaggerated her drawl just a little. \"The croissants put up a fight, Mr. Navarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"That\u0027s good. I wasn\u0027t sure you\u0027d have a sense of humour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a square with her arms and put them over her head. She was wearing a cutoff white Tshirt that said COUNTY LINE BBQ on it, and there was a small oval of sweat sticking the fabric to her tummy where the guitar had been. The skin under her arms was so white that her faint armpit stubble looked like ballpoint pen marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the last few mornings I\u0027ve had in the studio,\" she said, \"you\u0027ve got to have a sense of humour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to get the sound right. The engineers were saying something about the microphones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda stretched out her legs. She looked at her feet, then kicked her Jellies off with her big toes. \"It\u0027s not the microphone\u0027s fault. But that ain\u0027t what you\u0027re in here to talk about, is it? I\u0027m supposed to ask you about the gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered her a chocolate croissant. She seemed to think about it for a minute, then swung her legs onto the floor and sat up. She shook her head so her tangly black hair readjusted itself around her shoulders. She moistened her lips. Then she bypassed the chocolate croissant I was holding and went straight for the only ham and cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. A woman with taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudged the .22 with her finger. Country girl. Not somebody who was nervous around guns. \"Well, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the gun somebody used to shoot at John Crea. I found it in the thirdfloor garbage bin at the parking lot next door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda tore a corner off her croissant. \"Somebody just left it there? And the police didn\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to underestimate the stupidity of perps,\" I said. \"Cops know perps are stupid and they try to investigate accordingly, but sometimes they still underestimate. They overlook possibilities nobody with any sense would try, like using a .22 Montgomery Ward pistol for a hundred yard shot and dropping the gun in the garbage on their way to the elevator. Police are thinking the shooter must\u0027ve used a rifle and carried it away with him and ditched it somewhere else. That\u0027s what a smart person would do. Most people who get away with crimes, they don\u0027t do it smart. They do it stupid enough to baffle the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So—you taking the gun to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. Eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eventually? After what happened to poor Julie Kearnes, shot the exact same way—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Poor Julie was killed by a professional. Whoever left this was an amateur. Similar incidents, both people connected to you, but they weren\u0027t done by the same person. That\u0027s what I don\u0027t get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I could help—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you can. You know Sheckly a lot better than I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression hardened. \"I don\u0027t know him that well. And no, he wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody\u0027s trying to make things difficult for you since you started courting Century Records. You have any theory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda took a bite of my ham and cheese croissant. She nodded her head while she chewed. After she swallowed she said, \"You want me to admit Tilden Sheckly is a hard customer. Yes, sir. He is. He\u0027s got a bad temper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"But Sheck wouldn\u0027t do those things. He\u0027s known Willis, shoot—he\u0027s known all the families in Avalon County for a million years. I know what people think, but Sheck\u0027s always been a gentleman with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at me a little tentatively, like she was afraid I might contradict her, might ask her to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s such a great guy,\" I said, \"why did you sign with Les SaintPierre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda pressed her lips together, like she\u0027d just put on lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard of that lady who played out at the Paintbrush a few nights ago, Tammy Vaughn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda raised her eyebrows. Apparently she hadn\u0027t figured me for a country music fan. I liked her for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year ago,\" Miranda continued, \"Tammy Vaughn was where I am. She played mostly local gigs—South Texas, Austin. Mostly dance halls. Then she got a good agent and signed with Century Records. They\u0027re the only major label with a Texas office, did you know that? They\u0027ve started paying attention to the talent down here, picking out the best, and sending them on to Nashville. Now Tammy\u0027s playing for fifteen thousand a night. She opened for LeAnne Rimes in Houston. She\u0027s got a house in Nashville and one in Dallas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Sheckly can\u0027t do that for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad\u0027s barely paid the mortgage on his ranch for as long as I can remember. He does contracting all day and music all night and he won\u0027t ever be able to retire. We won\u0027t even talk about Brent. The idea of being able to help them out...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me it was just the promise of money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that, apparently decided to be honest. \"No. You\u0027re right. I signed with Les because of the way he talked, that first time we met. Something about Les SaintPierre—you can\u0027t just tell a fella like that no. Besides, Sheck or not—sometimes you have to make choices for your career. You don\u0027t always get to make everybody happy.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-18.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
