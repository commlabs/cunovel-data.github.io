Now I must do some burning. I will meet you at the station for your shift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t leave him alone for a minute,\" I muttered as I put on my uniform. After checking my weapons, I grabbed more ammo and slipped the totem over my head. \"Don\u0027t leave home without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t hard to find my man. I only had to drive to the place we\u0027d been the night before, then follow my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer stood watch over a much larger bonfire than he\u0027d made the last time. Thankfully, when I arrived what he was burning was no longer discernible - although I knew very well what it was. I\u0027d never had a weak stomach, but those days appeared to be gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said no hunting last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced my way. \"No hunting for you. You\u0027d had a shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have shocks every day. I can still do my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I did not need any help. When they returned to the cave it was like... how do you say... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShooting ducks in a pond?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord knows why. The image was not very appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did they come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me as if I\u0027d just announced, \"I was screwing a werewolf all afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave a mental wince. Better to not go there right now. That was one shock I wasn\u0027t quite up to handling, despite my brave words to the contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is their hidey-hole. Where they go to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"Why not just change... wherever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come in human form. They need a place to leave their clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch mundane problems had not occurred to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were clothes in the cave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any ID?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are werewolves, not idiots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved closer to the bonfire. \"They don\u0027t change back when they die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"A myth. If they die as a wolf, they remain a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. Having the wolves return to human form would have been too easy. But couldn\u0027t something be easy just once?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking... \" Mandenauer made a noncommittal murmur. \"Karen Larson hit a werewolf. Maybe we should be asking around about broken legs, hips, severe bruising.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shaking his head before I finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another myth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless she hit the wolf with a silver car, any injury would have healed almost immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that let Will off the hook -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for the bruise at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy radio crackled. \"Jessie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. Zee was at work early again. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got a call from Clearwater. About twelve campers have gone missing. They\u0027d like us to keep an eye out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten-four.\" I turned my gaze on the flames. \"I think I know where they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer didn\u0027t answer. When the silence became too loud, I asked, \"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We keep hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The others will not come back to this place now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not sure. Have you discovered anything new since I saw you last?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to tell him, but I had to. This entire situation was getting out of hand, and Mandenauer was the only one doing anything to stop the madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for the second time in twenty-four hours I spilled my guts. I told him everything and then some. When I was done, he stared into the dying fire for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should shoot your lover.\" I opened my mouth to protest, but he kept talking. \"But shooting people always gets me into trouble. Better to wait until they are wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard to argue with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking,\" I said. \"Why would Cadotte need to research the ceremony? Why would he want to help me discover the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps he was making sure you didn\u0027t discover it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By telling you enough to make you trust him, but not enough so you could stop it. He has also had his foot firmly in the enemy camp. Have you told him what you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face heated. He glanced at me sharply and sighed. \"Jessie. He could have killed you while you slept.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he didn\u0027t. Another thing bugs me. Why would he give back the totem if it\u0027s so important to the ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the totem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe and my big mouth. \"Uh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess I hadn\u0027t told him everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had it all along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once his expression reflected respect instead of annoyance. \"Good. From what you read, they can do nothing without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t make another one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was that simple they wouldn\u0027t be searching for it so hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone stole the evidence from the police station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cadotte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"But someone tossed his office, so it couldn\u0027t be him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps.\" I gave him a dirty look and his lips twitched. \"He could have ransacked the place himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But it still makes no sense for him to hand the totem back to me. He could have said he lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr it was stolen. I would have been in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think he\u0027s one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my mind everyone is one of them, until I know differently. Thinking in that manner has kept me alive for a long, long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a stick and bent over the fire, spreading the embers apart, trying to kick dirt over what was left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boot caught on a rock and I stumbled. Mandenauer grabbed my arm to keep me from eating ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body was between me and the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if from a long way off I heard an odd thunk. It wasn\u0027t until something whistled through the air that I realized what I\u0027d heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hadn\u0027t known the sound from memory, the arrow sticking out of Mandenauer\u0027s shoulder would have clued me in. He fell to his knees, narrowly missing the remains of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my weapon, crouched in front of him, and searched the tree line. Nothing was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer shoved me with his foot. \"Go. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d hauled his rifle into his lap, but with the arrow sticking out of his shoulder, he wouldn\u0027t be able to shoot very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"I\u0027m not going to leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s getting away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone and you know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered at the arrow more closely. A chill went over me. \"This is from a crossbow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePictures flashed in front of my eyes. Cadotte\u0027s semi-messy house. Papers. Books. Wolf head on the wall. Crossbow in the corner. Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Mandenauer and decided not to share. \"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to see the arrow, twisting this way and that. Blood stained his shirt in an alarming flood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. Quit moving around!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you tell what kind of bow it came from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shorter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It feels long enough to me.\" Sweat had broken out on his brow. His pale skin had gone a whole lot paler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\" I helped him to his feet with his good arm. \"Let\u0027s get you to a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just pull it out. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a bullet to chomp on, big boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind. I\u0027m not pulling that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what they want. For us to be taken away from the hunt. If we do not destroy the werewolf army before the blue moon, evil will walk the earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evil always walks the earth, in one form or another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled and I held on tighter. \"You are right. Even if we succeed here, there is always another monster somewhere else. It never ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, pal. Just what I needed to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with the knowledge that Cadotte had tried to kill me, the idea that monsters were everywhere, for always, made my day complete. For a woman who had scorned all things woo-woo, I\u0027d become awfully accepting of monsters. I suppose that was bound to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loaded Mandenauer into my car and headed for the emergency clinic, calling my whereabouts and the situation in to Zee on the way. She said she\u0027d inform Clyde, if she could find him. He had a habit of disappearing when he wasn\u0027t on duty. I couldn\u0027t blame him. A man needed some time away from the chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer closed his eyes. I thought about crossbows. They weren\u0027t common -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it was illegal in this state to hunt with one unless you were over sixty-five or physically incapacitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, owning one wasn\u0027t illegal, so its presence in Cadotte\u0027s house hadn\u0027t bothered me -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;until five minutes ago. He had a right to buy one and use it for target practice. I winced at the memory of who had been the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had kissed Cadotte, touched him, let him touch me in ways I\u0027d never let anyone else. Half an hour out of his bed, and he\u0027d tried to kill me. He could have told me he wanted to be just friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone else know you have that totem, Jessie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer\u0027s eyes were still closed. He faced me, his uninjured shoulder against the seat, the arrow sticking out of the other and pointing at the passenger window. Looking at it made me slightly nauseous, so I concentrated on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best to keep it that way, hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better safe than dead,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which brings me to the question: If they wanted us dead, why not use a bullet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This answering with a question stuff isn\u0027t answering at all, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy back teeth ground together so hard they hurt. \"Maybe I should pull that arrow out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be my guest,\" he said, but his voice was fading and there was blood on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove faster. By the time I reached the clinic, Man-denauer had passed out. I drove right up to the door and shouted for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same doctor was working. He glanced at me and frowned. \"I\u0027m starting to think you\u0027re bad luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey whisked Mandenauer away. An hour later I got to see him. He was fine but dopey. I figured now was as good a time as any to get a clear answer to any question I might ask. And I had quite a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did we have to shoot all the wolves? Wasn\u0027t there an easier way to get rid of them? Why couldn\u0027t we put them back the way they\u0027d been before all this started? If anyone would know how to cure a werewolf, wouldn\u0027t it be the man who\u0027d been hunting them for most of his life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in a chair next to his temporary bed. The small emergency section of the clinic didn\u0027t have rooms, only curtained partitions. If someone needed to stay longer than a night, they were sent to the hospital in Clearwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully Mandenauer wasn\u0027t that bad off, although he didn\u0027t look good. He\u0027d lost a lot of blood, which was being reintroduced via an IV. I hated those things. They felt like someone had stuck a knitting needle into a vein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor says you can leave in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened one eye, then closed it again. \"Yee-ha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"You\u0027ve been hanging out with me too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or perhaps not long enough.\" He opened both eyes. \"You saved my life. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you saved mine. But you\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not hunt tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were not a question, but I answered anyway -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;in a manner he could understand. \"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You are not trained to do so alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have much time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything else I can do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring me some vodka.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that will mix well with the drugs. Anyway, I meant is there anything else I can do to the werewolves? Isn\u0027t there a cure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None that I know of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart flipped and settled like a stone in my belly. \"None?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"That I know of that work. There are in-numerable theories, myths, legends. I prefer to be sure and use the silver. But I have an associate who has researched the cures. As of yet she\u0027s found nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was bad enough that Cadotte might be a werewolf, but I couldn\u0027t accept that there was no way to fix him. I wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer\u0027s eyes popped open. He\u0027d nearly been asleep. He waved a hand at his trousers, which were slung over a chair. \"Her number is in my wallet. Elise Hanover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already had the pants in my hand. \"Dr. Hanover?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She works at the CDC. Or maybe not.\" Confused, I stared at Mandenauer. \"She\u0027s one of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had my calls rerouted, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not be angry. I had all the calls out of Miniwa sent through my people. Do you think we want the entire world descending on this town before we get it cleaned up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought we\u0027d been lucky to avoid media mania. Instead we\u0027d been manipulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there with Mandenauer\u0027s trousers hanging from my hand and watched him drift off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time I turned around there was a new secret, another conspiracy, someone who wasn\u0027t who I thought they were. It was getting old. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-32.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
