{"id":23040,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. ON THE TRAIL OF GOLD.","content":"Keen on the scent of anything likely to turn to his own advantage, Lyman Taylor arranged the very next day to make a second visit to Pocasset, and find out definitely, if possible, whether his uncle had saved any of the large sum which his claim had yielded him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He hardly knew what to think. Anthony was not the man to waste money on extravagant living, but then he might have made poor investments, and reduced himself to a pittance. Cases of that kind were common enough in California, as Lyman knew well enough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He preferred, however, to think that his uncle had turned miser, and was still the possessor of a handsome fortune. In that case, as the only near relative, it ought to come to him some day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me see,\" he mused, \"how old is Uncle Anthony! Fifty-nine!\" he resumed, after a mental calculation. \"That isn\u0027t very old, but he looks a good deal older. He is about played out—a physical wreck,\" he reflected, complacently, \"and may not live a year.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In that damp cabin it could not be expected. Of course it\u0027s his own lookout. If he chooses to live there, I don\u0027t see that it\u0027s any of my business. I ought to come to a friendly understanding with him, and get him to recognize me as his heir. I dare say he\u0027s got his money hidden away in some out-of-the-way place. It would be a sorry joke if he should die, and it shouldn\u0027t be found.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman shuddered uneasily, as he thought of this contingency.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He ought to place his money in charge of some competent manager,\" he resumed. \"I\u0027d take care of it myself, and save him all business cares, if he\u0027d let me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman did not appreciate the absurdity of this plan. Few persons think themselves unfit to be trusted with money. What he thought of his own honesty can only be conjectured. Probably he did not regard himself with the eyes of those who knew him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such thoughts were passing through the mind of the hermit\u0027s nephew, as he was traveling from New York to Pocasset. Arrived at the depot, he set out for the village at a brisk pace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently he espied in advance of him a couple of boys, whose figures looked familiar. It did not take him long to recall the two boys he had met in the pasture on his former visit. Of course they were James and Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just the ones I want to see,\" he said to himself. \"I may get some news from them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He quickened his pace, and soon overtook them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good morning, young gentlemen!\" he said, urbanely. \"I believe we have met before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boys turned around. They, too, recognized him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir,\" answered James. \"You are old Anthony\u0027s nephew.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The same! I am glad you remember me. Have you seen or heard of my uncle lately?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; we saw him yesterday in the wood.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has he recovered from his rheumatic attack?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess so,\" said Tom. \"He is looking pretty well now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I came down to inquire his condition. I am his only relative, and though he is prejudiced against me, I can\u0027t help feeling anxious about his health. Can you tell me anything about him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has that boy, Mark Manning, about him all the time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What can be the boy\u0027s object in keeping company with a poor old man, who has no way of rewarding him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not so sure about that,\" said James.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About what?\" asked Lyman, quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About his being poor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you any reason to think my uncle has money?\" asked Lyman, eagerly, fixing a sharp glance of inquiry on the speaker.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James looked at Tom, as if to consult him about the propriety of telling what he knew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As I am his nephew and only relation, and—heir,\" continued Lyman, \"you can freely tell me anything you have found out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Would you?\" asked James, turning to his companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t see why not,\" returned Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then,\" said James, who rather enjoyed the prospect of telling the story, \"I\u0027ll tell you what I saw the other day—that is, Tom and I.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, yes, what did you see?\" interrupted Lyman, eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We were out in the woods about a quarter of a mile from the hermit\u0027s cabin, when we all at once heard voices. Slipping behind a tree we saw old Anthony and Mark coming along. Mark had a spade over his shoulder. We wondered what it all meant, and so kept hidden. Well, the two came up to a big tree, and then measured with a tape measure to a place about a rod distant. Then old Anthony took the spade and began to dig. But I guess he got tired, for pretty soon he gave the spade to Mark, and got him to dig.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\" ejaculated Lyman, who was listening with intense interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pretty soon he struck something hard. It turned out to be an earthen pot with a cover.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did they take it up?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; but Mark took off the cover, and then took out, oh, such a lot of gold pieces.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just what I thought!\" exclaimed Lyman, in excitement. \"I was sure my uncle kept his money hidden in the ground somewhere. Do you know how much money he took out of the jar?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There must have been hundreds of dollars—maybe a thousand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The cover was put on again, and then Mark filled up the hole, and covered it with leaves, so that nobody would think the ground had been disturbed, then they went away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That shows there must be more money there, don\u0027t you think so?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course, or they wouldn\u0027t have taken so much trouble to cover it up again,\" answered James, readily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are right. I see you are sharp. What a fine detective you would make!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James looked pleased at this compliment, and it inclined him in favor of the appreciative stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think,\" asked Lyman, after a pause, \"you could find the spot again?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I guess so. Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should like to go there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But,\" objected James, cautiously, \"what would you do if you found it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would dig down and find the jar.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you would have no right to do that; the money belongs to old Anthony.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who is my uncle. But you are mistaken. I don\u0027t want to take it. I want to see if the gold is still there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why shouldn\u0027t it be?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because,\" answered Lyman, with a lucky thought, \"the boy knows where it is. What is to prevent his going there by himself and carrying off all there is. My uncle would have no proof that it was he.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never thought of that,\" said James, quickly. \"It would be just like Mark.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think he is honest?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wouldn\u0027t answer for him. He is a poor boy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Exactly, and the gold would be a great temptation. As the legal heir of Uncle Anthony, I think I ought to look into the matter. Suppose my uncle should die, wouldn\u0027t this Mark get the money, even if he hasn\u0027t done it already, and no one would be the wiser?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course!\" James readily assented. \"What do you want us to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lead me to the place, and let me see for myself if the money is still there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shall we, Tom?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think it would be only fair.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then come along. I\u0027ll get a spade from the house as we pass.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The spade was obtained, and the three set out for the wood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53039.html","bookId":1019,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM"}
