It shouldn’t bother me, but it does. Maybe he still wants to be with her. She would probably fit him better. No sneaking around or having to deal with someone who has no idea what she’s doing when it comes to relationships. Someone like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screech of brakes makes me sit up in bed. It’s followed closely by the sound of the front door slamming open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Megan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove by her house a dozen times, and I couldn’t see a car in the driveway. I went everywhere I could think of. I decide to drive by her house again. I won\u0027t stop searching until I find her, even if it means I do it forever. When I see Janet’s and Phil’s cars out front, I tear into the driveway. I jump out and bust through the front door, shouting her name. I just have to see her. I don’t think I’ve gone this long without her since this all began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rush through the kitchen and see Janet standing there, her eyes wide with shock and worry. I must look like a mess, but I feel like I’ve gone crazy. I round the corner, and see Phil leaning against the door frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s upstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone of voice is calm and knowing. I need to tell him. “Phil—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I’ve known for some time, but I wanted you to man up and tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry about the way this happened, but I’m not sorry I love her. I don’t know why or how, but she’s the one. She’s it for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me and searches my eyes, for what, I don’t know. But he must see what he needs, because he nods his head. “I won’t lie and tell you this is easy for me. She’s my baby girl, she’ll always be my baby girl, but I know she won’t find better.” He reaches his hand out to mine and I take his, thankful for his approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What just happened?” Janet says behind me, and I see Phil smile sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll explain later, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get out.” Megan’s voice from behind Phil makes me snap to attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, listen. You’ve got to let me explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard everything. I thought I was special. I thought I was different. But you and that woman, you…you were going to marry her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frustrating rage fills my veins and I want to scream. I take a deep breath and try to explain this as swiftly as possible. I need to take her hurt away. I can see she’s torn up about this, and I never intended for this to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That woman, Delilah, she and I went on one date together five years ago. Five years ago. I was traveling a lot with the team then, but even still I knew she was trouble and ended it after that one dinner. She went crazy, Megan. She went to the press, said we were engaged, said she was pregnant with my baby…I never even touched her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan crosses her arms defensively, still looking at me in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear to God, Megan. It’s the truth. It’s probably still online somewhere. I had to get a restraining order, and I sued her. We settled out of court and she swore never to bother me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God, Delilah is back?” I hear Janet say behind me. Janet and Phil were my rocks back then, helping get me through that mess. I felt like such a dick taking her to court, but they both kept reminding me that she needed serious help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called the cops and they took her to the hospital. From what they said, she’d been under her sister\u0027s care, but had a recent relapse when her boyfriend broke up with her. Guess she was just making the rounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan looks back and forth between her parents, and I can see hope in her eyes. “Dad, is this true?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. She was really unstable, and I was able to get a psychologist friend of mine to look over the case,” he says, confirming everything I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, if I had known that was the problem, I could have told you the whole story. My God, you and Chris? When did this happen?” Janet sounds utterly shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan blushes profusely, and looks at me through her lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Janet, let’s give them a chance to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil pulls her from the room as she keeps asking questions. “How did you…” I hear her saying over her shoulder as they walk out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you didn’t want babies with her?” she asks, looking down at her feet. I hate that she thought I wanted with someone else what I only want with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan takes a tentative step towards me, and I stand my ground, not wanting to scare her off. I’m sure I look crazy. I felt crazy when she left me today. The thought of her running from me was like a hot blade to my heart. She’s it for me. If she doesn\u0027t want me, I\u0027ll live out a miserable existence. Or I\u0027ll have to buy a secluded island, kidnap her, and keep her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you never wanted to marry her?” she asks, looking up at me through her eyelashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I fire back instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t love her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes another small step forward, and I can feel my heart beating out of my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve loved one woman in my life, and that’s you, Megan. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rushes the rest of the way and I catch her, wrapping my arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, Chris.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go home, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her nod against my neck, and I close my eyes. Finally my world is whole again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coach-breeding-1/page-19.html","bookId":1800,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:28 PM"}
