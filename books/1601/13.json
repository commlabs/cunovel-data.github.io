Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met an Aiel woman while traveling to Rhuidean\", Aviendha said. \"She claimed not to be a Wise One, but she had a way about her . . \". She shook her head. \"The question was merely idle curiosity\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we shall know some of the truth of these visions\", Bair said, stepping toward the gateway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they are true, Bair?\" Aviendha found herself asking. \"What if there isn’t anything we can do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBair turned. \"You saw your children, you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha nodded. She hadn’t spoken in detail of that segment of the vision. It had seemed more personal to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change one of their names\", Bair said. \"Never speak of the name that child was called in the vision, not even to us. Then you shall know. If one thing is different, then others may be different as well. Will be different. This is not our fate, Aviendha. It is a path we will avoid. Together\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha found herself nodding. Yes. A simple change, a small change, but full of meaning. \"Thank you, Bair\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aging Wise One nodded to her, then stepped through the gateway, running in the night toward the city ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes threw his shoulder against a hulking, boar-faced Trolloc in crude chain armor. The beast smelled horrid, like smoke, wet fur and unwashed flesh. It grunted at the force of Talmanes’ assault; the things always seemed surprised when he attacked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes pulled back, ripping his sword out of the beast’s side as it collapsed. He then lunged forward and rammed his sword into its throat, heedless of its ragged fingernails scratching at his legs. Life faded from the beady, too-human eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen fought, called, grunted, killed. The street ran up a steep incline toward the Palace. Trolloc hordes had entrenched here, holding position and keeping the Band from reaching the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes sagged against the side of a building—the one next to it was on fire, lighting the street with violent colors and bathing him in heat. Those fires seemed chilly compared to the flaring, horrible pain of his wound. The flare ran down his leg to his foot and was beginning to work its way across his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and bloody ashes, he thought. What I’d give for another few hours with my pipe and book, alone and peaceful. The people who spoke of glorious death in battle were complete flaming fools. There was nothing glorious about dying in this mess of fire and blood. Give him a quiet death any day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes pushed himself back up to his feet, drops of sweat falling from his face. Below, Trollocs amassed themselves behind his rear position. They had closed the road behind Talmanes’ force, but Talmanes was able to proceed, cutting through the Trollocs ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetreat would be difficult to pull off. As well as this roadway being full of Trollocs, fighting in the city meant that Trollocs could wind through the streets in small groups and attack his flanks, as they advanced and later when they retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Throw everything you’ve got at them, men!\" he bellowed, hurling himself up the street and into the Trollocs blocking the way up. The Palace was quite close now. He caught a goat-faced Trollocs sword on his shield right before it would have taken off Dennel’s head. Talmanes tried to shove the beast’s weapon back, but Light, Trollocs were strong. Talmanes barely kept this one from throwing him to the ground as Dennel recovered and attacked its thighs, bringing it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelten fell in beside Talmanes. The Borderlander was true to his word to stay close, in case Talmanes needed a sword to end his life. The two led the push up the hill. The Trollocs began to give, then rallied, a snarling, roaring heap of dark fur, eyes and weapons in the firelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steady!\" Talmanes yelled. \"For Lord Mat and the Band of the Red Hand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Mat were here, he would probably curse a lot, complain as much, then proceed to save them all with some battlefield miracle. Talmanes couldn’t reproduce Mat’s blend of insanity and inspiration, but his yell did seem to encourage the men. The ranks tightened. Gavid arrayed his two dozen crossbowmen—the last Talmanes had with him—atop a building that hadn’t burned away. They started driving flight after flight of bolts into the Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might have broken human enemies, but not Trollocs. The bolts dropped a few, but not as many as Talmanes would have hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s another Fade back there, Talmanes thought. Pushing them forward. Light, I can’t fight another. I shouldn’t have fought the one I did!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldn’t be on his feet. Melten’s flask of brandy was gone, long since drained to deaden what it could. His mind was already as fuzzy as he dared allow. He fell in with Dennel and Londraed at the front, fighting, concentrating. Letting Trolloc blood out onto the cobbles to stream down the hillside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Band gave a good fight of it, but they were outnumbered and exhausted. Down below, another Trolloc fist joined the ones on the street behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it. He would have to either hit that force behind—turning his back on the one in front—or break his men into smaller units and send them retreating through side streets to regroup at the gate below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes prepared to give the orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forward the White Lion!\" voices yelled. \"For Andor and the Queen!\" Talmanes spun as men in white and red broke through the Trolloc lines atop the hill. A second force of Andoran pikemen poured out of a side alleyway, coming in behind the Trolloc horde that had just surrounded him. The Trollocs broke before the oncoming pikemen, and in moments the entire mass—like a pus-filled blister—burst, Trollocs scattering in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes stumbled back. Momentarily he had to prop himself up with his sword as Madwin took command of the counterstrike and his men killed many of the fleeing Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of officers in bloodied Queens Guard uniforms rushed down the hillside; they didn’t look any better than the Band. Guybon led them. \"Mercenary\", he said to Talmanes, \"I thank you for showing up\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes frowned. \"You act as if we saved you. From my perspective, it happened the other way around\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuybon grimaced in the firelight. \"You gave us some respite; those Trollocs were attacking the Palace gates. I apologize for taking so long to reach you—we didn’t realize, at first, what had drawn them in this direction\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light.
