The biblical scapegoat and Christian Redeemer are cast from the same ancient mould - the human subservient to an unpredictable universe (or unpredictable king) and seeking to rid himself of the guilt which brings down the wrath of the all-powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Raja Flattery, The Book of Ship\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAGAIN, THE communications pellet in Oakes\u0027 neck made no contact with Lewis. Static or silence, wild images projected onto his waking dreams - these were all he got. He wanted to reach into his neck and rip the thing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had Lewis ordered no physical contact with the Redoubt? Oakes chafed at his own inability to raise too much disturbance. The real purposes of the Redoubt remained a secret from most Shipmen; to most it was just a rumored exploratory attempt out on Black Dragon. He did not dare countermand the order which had isolated the Redoubt. Too many would see the size of the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis can\u0027t do this to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes paced his cubby, wishing it were even larger. He wanted to walk off his frustrations but it was full dayside out in the ship\u0027s passages and he knew he would be plagued by the need to make decisions once he stepped from his sanctum. Rumors were raging through the ship. Many had noted his upset. This could not go on much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would go down mysel.... excep....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, without Lewis to prepare the way, it is too dangerous. Oakes shook his head. He was too valuable to risk down there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit, Lewis! You could send me some messag....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes had come increasingly to suspect that Lewis really was involved in a primary emergency. That or treachery. N.... it had to be an emergency. Lewis was not a leader. Then it had to be a major threat from the planet itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, Pandora was a more immediate and dangerous adversary than the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes glanced at the blank holofocus beside his couch. A touch of the buttons would call up real-time images of the planet. To what avail? He had tried a sensor search of the Black Dragon coastline from space. Too many cloud.... not enough detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could identify the coastal bay where the Redoubt was being built, could even see glinting reflections during the diurn passages of Alki or Rega.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes took a deep breath to calm himself. This planet was not going to beat him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re mine, Pandora!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he had told Legata, anything was possible down there. They could fulfill any fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes examined his hands, rubbed them across his bulging stomach. He was determined that he would never under any circumstances grub out a living on the surface of a planet. Especially on a planet he owned. This was only natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship conditioned me to be what I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than any other person he had ever known, Oakes felt that he knew the nature of the ship\u0027s conditioning processes - the differences from what they had been when they had lived free to scatter on Earth\u0027s surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the crush of peopl.... too many people too close together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShipside congestion had been transported groundside. This way of life demanded special adaptations. All Shipmen adjusted the same way at bottom. They drugged themselves, gambled - risked everythin.... even their own lives. Running the Colony perimeter naked except for thonged feet. And for what? A bet! A dare! To hide from themselves. In his long walks through the ship, Oakes knew how he screened out the comings and goings of others. Like most Shipmen, he could retreat into the deepest interior of his mind for privacy, for entertainment, for living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn these times of food shortage, this faculty had been especially valuable to him. Oakes knew himself to be th.... heaviest man shipside. He knew there was envy and angry questioning, but even so no one stared directly at him with such thoughts openly readable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I know these people. They need me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Edmond Kingston\u0027s tutelage, he had studied well for the psychiatric side of his specialty - all the banks of records handed down for generation.... eons maybe. The way the ship had put them in and out of hyb, the passage of real time had been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat unknown length of time bothered Oakes. And the translations from the records produced too many anomalies. Popular apology for the ship said the confusion arose from Ship\u0027s attempt to rescue as many people as possible. Oakes did not believe this. The translations hinted at too many other explanations. Translation? The ship controlled even that. You asked a computer to render the unintelligible intelligible. But linguists pointed out that among the languages found in Records were some which existed in a free-floating universe of their own - without discernible beginnings nor descendents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to the folk of those rich linguistic heritages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even know what happened to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis childhood memories told him things, though. Compared to the people of the Earth from which the ship had plucked them, Shipmen were freaks - all of them, clone and Natural Natal alike. Freaks. The shipside mind had become a place to live very quickly for those who had little space, few private possessions to call their own, for people torn between WorShip and dismay. Shipmen cultivated the skills of personalizing whatever the ship provided them. Functional simplicity did not bear the onus or sense of restriction that arbitrary simplicity carried. Each tool, each bowl and spoon and pair of chopsticks, each cubby bore the signature of the user in some small fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cubby is merely a larger manifestation of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mind, too, was the outpost of privacy, a last place to sit and whittle something sensible out of an insane universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the Ceepee was above it all; even while he participated, he was above. Oakes felt that sometimes the people around him wore signs revealing their innermost thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about this Raja Thomas? Another Ceepee and he studied me carefull.... much the way I sometimes study others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to Oakes then that he had grown careless. Since old Kingston\u0027s death, he had thought himself immune to the probing study of others, alone in the ability to snare a Shipman\u0027s psyche. It was dangerous for someone else to have that weapon. Just one more reason this Thomas would have to be eliminated. Oakes realized he had been pacing back and forth in his cubby - to the mandala, turn and back to the com-console, once more to the mandal.... He was confronted by the com-console when this realization struck him. His hand went out to the keys and he brought into the holofocus a scene from Agrarium D-9 out on shiprim. He stared at the bustle of workers, at the filtered blue-violet light which set these peoples apart in a world of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYe.... if independence from the ship were possible, it would begin with food and the cultivation of life. The axolotl tanks, the clone labs, the biocomputer itself - all were but sophisticated toys for the well fed, the sheltered and clothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feed men, then ask of them virtue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was an old voice from one of his training records. A wise voice, a practical one. The voice of a survivor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes continued to stare at the workers. They attended their plants with total attention, occupation and preoccupation linked in a particular reverence which he had sensed only among older Shipmen during WorShip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese agrarium workers engaged in a kind of WorShip. WorShip!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes chuckled, amused by the thought of WorShip reduced to tending plants in an agrarium. What a grand sight they must be in the eyes of a god! A pack of sniveling beggars. What kind of a god kept its charges in poverty to hear them beg? Oakes could understand a touch of subjugation, bu.... this? This spoke to something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had to be boss, and the rest have to be reminded of that occasionally. Otherwise, how can anything be organized to work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo; he heard the message. It said that the ship\u0027s programs were running out. All of the problems were being dumped on the Ceepee\u0027s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at those workers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew they did not have the time to make the ordering decisions for their own lives. When? After work? Then the body was tired and the mind was dulled into a personal reverie which precluded insightful judgments for the good of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good of all - that\u0027s my job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe freed them from the agony of the decisions which they were not well informed enough, not energetic enough, nor even intelligent enough to make. It was the Ceepee who gave them that more pleasant gift of drifting time, the time to seek their own ease and recreations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecreatio.... Re-creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe association flitted through his mind. Re-creation was where they were made new again, where all they worked for was made real, where they lived. Looking down at the agrarium workers in the holofocus, Oakes felt like the conductor of an intricate musical score. He reminded himself to remember that analogy for the next general meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConductor of a symphony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked that. It was food for thought. Did the ship have such thoughts? He experienced a sudden feeling of affinity for the ship, his enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat food are we that we deserve reverence and care? What manna? Could the shi.... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis reverie was shattered by the abrupt opening hiss of his cubby hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho dare.... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hatch slammed back against the bulkhead and Lewis darted through, sealed the opening behind him and dogged it. He was breathing hard and, instead of his usual self-effacing brown fatigues, he wore a crisp new issue singlesuit of dark green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lewis!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes was overjoyed to see the ma.... and then dismayed. When Lewis turned at the sealed hatch, it was apparent that his face bore signs of quick medical patchwork to cover numerous cuts and bruises. And he was limping. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-21.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
