It’s not worth it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the groups of bats were running amok, he had used a concealment spell. Hence, he had naturally not been pursued or attacked by the bats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter doing some experiments, Leylin made up his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Night Vision!” He used this spell on himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an essential spell for many Magi in the subterranean world. With this spell, they could see things in the dark as if it were day without giving off any light that would attract aggressive beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip, display the map in your records!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he casted the spell, Leylin gave an order to the A.I. Chip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately after, a 3D image appeared in front of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the simulated model the A.I. Chip had formed after analysing the map Celine had given him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby Leylin, there were red dots that constantly moved nearby Leylin, indicating the activity of high-energy beings. Compared to the previous inflexible map, this was even more detailed and reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a cave like this that was as complicated as a maze, Leylin had a definite advantage with his A.I. Chip. At the very least, with the A.I. Chip recording down everything, he would not get lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe icy cave could easily cause people to get lost. Every year, there were acolytes or even Magi in the guild who got completely lost in the cave. According to other Magi, if they had been enticed to enter deeper areas, they would have likely died in the mouths of the dark elemental beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Show me the best route to where the Icy Jade Scorpions are the most active!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin ordered once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, on the surface of the 3D map, a red line extended from the marker for Leylin’s current location. It led to the deeper levels of the icy cave, even marking a few important areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked around him and then disappeared into the crevasse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the fort, in a concealed room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkrill saw the scene of Celine sending Leylin into the icy caves through a crystal ball, a grim expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did that bitch Celine think that I wouldn’t dare do anything to her if she found a peak rank 1 Magus to depend on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkrill’s facial muscles began to contort as he stared at the shapely body in the image, his expression especially insatiable and passionate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re mine, and I will get you and make you my most beautiful treasure!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkrill moaned in an abnormal way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it? Have you made your decision?” Meanwhile, in a corner of the world, black mist rose and constantly changed shape, eventually turning into a human figure with vague features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a large issue with your plan. Celine has already recruited a peak rank 1 Magus into her Nature’s Alliance. Our original plan will not work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of others, Skrill concealed his previous expression and seemed cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peak rank 1?!” A startled gasp was heard from the mist. “Is your information accurate? Why would a peak rank 1 Magus be willing to join a small guild?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How would I know?” Skrill’s face darkened. Being scared away by Leylin like that was the ultimate humiliation for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He could easily repel the elemental particles around me, and his elemental conversion was at a very high level. Even if he’s not a peak rank 1 Magus, he can’t be too far from that… I wonder if that whore, Celine, tempted him…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of Celine, Skrill’s mood worsened again, leaving him feeling frustrated and unresigned, as if a delicacy meant for him had been robbed by someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeje, a peak rank 1 Magus is a little troublesome, but you should also believe in the guild backing us. A peak rank 1 Magus is definitely not enough to hinder our plan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person shrouded in the mist was very confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you plan to do? A peak rank 1 Magus isn’t so easily dealt with. Besides, two peak rank fighting would definitely lead to a huge commotion. Aren’t you afraid of being exposed?” A curious look appeared on Skrill’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeje! It’s not as if we don’t have a peak rank 1 Magus in our organisation. Did you forget about that good opportunity we have? He will definitely accept!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you mean…” Skrill’s eyes brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin breathed out white mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment water vapour reached the outside air, it immediately condensed into tiny crystals that fell to the ground and produced slight sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip, what’s the current temperature?” Leylin casually asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[The temperature is now -75 degrees Celsius!” The A.I. Chip immediately answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis temperature was more than deadly for regular humans, but in Leylin’s eyes, this was a mere chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he advanced deeper, he reached the very borders that Celine’s map had indicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this place that he entered the territory where the Icy Jade Scorpions were active.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath!” Fire burned in Leylin’s eyes. This material was extremely effective in suppressing the issues he had from his bloodline, and so he definitely needed to get his hands on it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the overall data and gene composition was different between Magi, this was as good as hitting the jackpot for Leylin. If he missed this opportunity, he really had no clue where he would find this material again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Discovered being that matches Host’s description. Distance: 621 metres.] The A.I. Chip prompted, causing Leylin to perk up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed in the direction the A.I. Chip indicated, and not long after, he saw the actual body of the being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the tunnels of the icy caves, there was a huge cave, on the surface of which were mosses and little bushes, forming a rather infertile area where food was produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, two groups of beings were having an intense confrontation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one end was a large, transparent, green scorpion that looked as if its entire body was made of green ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two large pincers in front constantly danced back and forth, and its venomous sting curved behind it, moving erratically and looking ready to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue, chilly air was produced occasionally, from the mouth of this Icy Jade Scorpion, and spat towards its opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith just a look, Leylin knew that this large Icy Jade Scorpion was what he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing the Icy Jade Scorpion was a group of blue ants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese ants were the size of a mature adult’s finger. Their two large and sharp saw teeth kept opening and closing, producing terrifying, ear-piercing sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a pity that in the face of the hard shell of the Icy Jade Scorpion, their attacks were futile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if they crawled all over the body of the Icy Jade Scorpion, they could not affect its movements. On the contrary, every time the Icy Jade Scorpion raised its large pincers, numerous ants were sent flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chilly air puffed out by the Icy Jade Scorpion also froze many of the ants into little crystals, which it then swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a battle where the Icy Jade Scorpion was foraging for food. It was the absolute winner here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip, scan the data of the Icy Jade Scorpion in front of me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin immediately ordered. After advancing to become a rank 2 Warlock, the A.I. Chip that was spiritually bonded to him had also gained many benefits. Besides a power up in its simulation abilities, beings like this that had force-field related innate skills could have their data taken down as long as they were below rank 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, for beings above rank 2, the A.I. Chip would be discovered and counterattack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Icy Jade Scorpion’s Strength: 15.9, Agility: 10.3, Vitality: 25, Spiritual force: 45, Special attacks: 1. Icy Breath: An attack where the Icy Jade Scorpion spits out large amounts of extreme icy air. Power: 30-45 degrees. 2. Freeze: When heavily injured, the Icy Jade Scorpion can seal itself in ice and lower its bodily needs to the minimum level until its body completely heals. 3. Icy Armour: The icy layer on the surface of the Icy Jade Scorpion’s body can effectively defend against physical and magical attacks, and also has a slight rebound effect on light magic.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip quickly sent out a row of data, and displayed a projection of that Icy Jade Scorpion in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even amongst rank 1 Magi, this is quite powerful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin judged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Magus’s strength could generally be decided based on their spiritual force. Acolytes were definitely below 20, while rank 1 Magi, which were otherwise known as official Magi, had a spiritual force between 20 and 80. As for rank 2 Magi, it was above 80. Based on Leylin’s conjectures and the simulations from the A.I. Chip, the spiritual force of peak rank 2 Magi could reach 200!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength of most rank 1 Magi’s spells was between 20 and 80 degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only were its various stats extremely high, the strength of its breath could even reach past a degree of 30. With its innate defensive spell-like icy armour, even a regular rank 1 Magus was not its opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This strength is almost that of a semi-converted Magus. I wonder what the elites or even emperors of the Icy Jade Scorpions are like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the battle had also reached an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-323\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-325\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-324","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
