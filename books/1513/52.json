It was also guarded by a black-robed man with theRedbud insignia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A.I. Chip! Initiate area scan!\" After walking out of the village, Leylin ordered after walking out of the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint light blue screen was projected in front of Leylin\u0027s eyes, clearly identifying a sneaky figure tailing him from behind. In the whole light blue projection, the red dot was extremely obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Target\u0027s identified. strength estimated at level 2 acolyte. No magic artifact detected!] The A.I. Chip\u0027s voice intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a level 2 acolyte huh? Seems like it\u0027s not any huge faction, but only an avaricious dog after some wealth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s eyes flashed coldly, \"If I didn\u0027t have other plans ......\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe level 2 acolyte tailing Leylin seemed to be extremely patient. Only after Leylin was a dozen miles away from the vicinity of the market did he make his sneak attack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Whoosh! * Suddenly two balls of mud rose beneath Leylin\u0027s feet, turning into two yellow-brown coloured hands that tightly held down Leylin\u0027s ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dagger suffused with purple light immediately stabbed towards Leylin\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Success!\" yelled the sneak attacking acolyte whose face was flushed with joy. He belatedly realised that Leylin had mysteriously dissolved, turning into a vine with thorns that coiled around his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thorns mercilessly dug into flesh. The acolyte could even feel the vine come alive and was greedily feeding on his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn! It\u0027s a golem! What is this spell! Shadow Embodiment? Leeching Vines?\" As the acolyte lost huge amounts of blood, he increasingly became muddleheaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah! You can\u0027t do this! Please......Please spare me......\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe acolyte pleaded. Alas, the immediately the vines squirmed and sealed his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! * The spell\u0027s effect disappeared, and on the ground was left the shrivelled corpse of the acolyte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst his enemies, Leylin was never merciful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second day, Leylin once again visited the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir! Do you need a guide? I only require 1 magic crystal!\" The noisy little kids were still clamouring at the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday Leylin had changed his clothes. And to conceal himself even further, he changed his appearance too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his previous face was a fake, there was no guaranteed special spell effect that could penetrate and see through the cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for energy waves and the sort, Leylin was not too worried about it. Yesterday he deliberately avoided official Magi, so his energy waves would never be recorded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo capture the energy waves generated by the spiritual force, an official Magus has to make enough preparations beforehand. There wouldn\u0027t be any Magi who had nothing better to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll do!\" Leylin randomly picked a little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you! Sir, I am extremely familiar with this place!\" The little girl was a little overjoyed. She wore a white coloured dress and looked to be somewhat thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter tossing a magic crystal to the girl, Leylin said slowly, \"I wish to enter a higher leveled area!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was modified to sound different from the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A higher leveled area? You mean......The second level?\" The little girl asked a little hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\" This was the point to the experience Leylin patiently amassed after coming to the market many times. These markets weren\u0027t very huge, and Leylin always felt that something was missing. Certain precious resources were absent in these markets too. These little children guides most likely stood here waiting for powerful customers to bring them to the more concealed areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since you know about the second level, then you should also understand that if you don\u0027t have an item worth over 1000 magic crystals or a guarantor, you will be denied entry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally I do! Lead the way!\" The little girl raised her head, yet she was unable to discern the expression behind Leylin\u0027s cloak. She could only lower her head and lead the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although there should be many official Magi on the second level, there is no choice. The two ancient formulas, Azure Potion, and Tears of Mary, plus many of their ingredients have not been collected yet. If I can\u0027t even find it here, biggest Magus market, then there is completely no chance anymore. I can only look for substitute ingredients!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s expression was rather dark. As he journeyed, he sold potions along the way and did his utmost to collect all of the ingredients of the two ancient potions. However, he was met with little success so far. Ellinel Market was the second largest gathering of Magi after Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. If he couldn\u0027t find what he needed here, then Leylin was completely helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin followed the little girl. They arrived at a rather deserted alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used a stone found on a wall corner of the wall to knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! * The alley\u0027s walls shifted, revealing an underground passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it is!\" The little girl said softly, as if very afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lead the way!\" Leylin followed the little girl and they continued walking downwards. Several minutes later, they reached a door at the end of the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo level 3 acolytes wearing blood red robes were standing guard. According to the A.I. Chip\u0027s scan, they carried magic artifacts on their bodies. This slightly startled Leylin. At the same time, he was filled with curiosity towards the market behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl went forward and exchanged a few words with the two acolytes before walking back to Leylin. She curtseyed, \"Most respected Sir, I can only lead you this far!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished speaking, she hurriedly ran back up the flight of stairs disappearing into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like there is something in this premium market that terrifies her!\" Leylin thought indifferently as he walked towards the two acolytes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An item of proof, or an item worth at least 1000 magic crystals!\" A red robed acolyte said icily. Standing before them, Leylin could somehow sense the wails of aggrieved souls hovering around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What terrifying people!\" Leylin thought inwardly. He tossed over a small sack containing 10 high-grade magic crystals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red robed acolyte opened and looked before tossing the sack back to Leylin. He then opened the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin walked in unhurriedly. Only after the large door closed behind him, was he inclined to observe the area in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis field was most likely beneath the market earlier. Its surface area was smaller, only having a street traversing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom time to time Magi walked past. Since it was not very crowded, the distance between passersby was rather far. There were almost no level 1 acolytes here. Level 2 acolytes too were very few. Most of the people here were level 3 acolytes. Their bodies all radiated strong energy waves. Official Magi too were rather common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin inhaled deeply and walked down the street......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, Leylin walked out of a stone hut with a Potion sign, his face had obvious signs of joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had the main ingredients Kroft mentioned, as well as the rest of the ingredients, \"It is indeed the largest market!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main ingredients of the two ancient potions, Azure Potion, and Tears of Mary, were the most important. As for other ingredients, they were easier to acquire. Being able to buy them all at once exceeded Leylin\u0027s expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin spent more than half of the 1000 magic crystals he prepared to purchase these ingredients. He was still satisfied, though, and felt that the expense was worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting away the ingredients, he anticipated that he had to find a safe place and begin brewing the potions. His mood was rather good. He even felt inclined to stroll around a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goods here were obviously of a higher grade than the market above. Leylin even saw a low-grade magic artifact dagger for sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the price was at least 400 magic crystals, which immediately made Leylin stop feeling lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Leylin heard noisy clamouring voices travelled over leaving Leylin a little startled. He tracked these voices and made a new discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slave market?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Leylin saw in front of him was a large fenced area. Many stark naked slaves were standing behind fences. Their faces showed either numb indifference or extreme humiliation as they let the acolytes and Magi take their pick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just right! I\u0027ll need a few slaves myself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin wanted to stay in Extreme Night Town for around 3 years. He could not manage many things by himself. Originally, he planned to recruit a few guards and servants when he got there, but a few high-grade slaves were now conveniently available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, they were all raised or controlled by Magi. This lent their owner better security and assured functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir! What do you think? Do you need a female slave for your bed?\" Look, these are all good quality ones, some are even of the nobility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slave trader looked as Leylin walked forward. The slaver hurriedly patted the ample breasts of a group of female slaves behind him, which carried a rippling wave effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him were a dozen utterly naked noblewomen. Their skin was extremely smooth, and their figures were quite vivacious. Even if they were slaves, their aura of nobility could not be stifled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they end up here? I mean, as nobles, wouldn\u0027t it be troublesome?\" Leylin was a little curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t worry, these are all nobles who fought and lost in battles. Their fiefdoms have long since been usurped and their families destroyed. They are legally under the death sentence. There will absolutely be no trouble at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trader smugly explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked behind a noblewoman who was being dragged away. There was obviously a noble young lady standing there. He could not help but think of the young noble lady he met previously in the woods. If her revenge failed, who knows if she\u0027ll be sold at this place too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are they? Buy a couple, and it\u0027s up to you how you play them! After you\u0027re sick of them, you can use them for your experiments. Even if they die, it\u0027s not a problem!\" The trader did his utmost to entice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin shook his head, \"I wish to purchase a few guards, preferably of a Knight\u0027s level. Also, I will need a few assistants for my experiments!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s like this!\" The trader stroked his chin, \"What you\u0027re looking for are premium slaves, and their price will be extraordinary! Of course, those who are able to enter here are customers with strength. Please follow me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin walked behind the trader and saw many slaves. Some of them were well-built youths while some were still children. They were all staring outside from behind the fence looking fearful. From time to time a few Magi pointed at them or even walked forward to inspect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin even saw a group of Magi surrounding a few beastmen and marine species slaves, bidding over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trader pulled Leylin to a large tent, and called a fatty over, \"This is my friend, Dylan. Right, he has some premium goods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin did not know what Dylan whispered to the trader, but after a while, the trader laughed heartily as he walked away. Only then Dylan smile towards Leylin and said, \"Most respected guest, I have already understood your requirements! We just received a new batch of premium slaves, please follow me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-51\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-53\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-52","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
