They looked to be in their twenties, and neither noticed me. The one who\u0027d bumped into me shoved the other one hard, forcing him to stagger back considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re afraid!\" yelled the guy by me. He had on green swimming trunks, and his black hair was slicked back with water. \"You\u0027re all afraid. You just want to hole up in your mansions and let the guardians do your dirty work. What are you going to do when they\u0027re all dead? Who\u0027ll protect you then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other guy wiped the blood off his face with the back of his hand. I suddenly recognized him- thanks to his blond highlights. He was the royal who\u0027d yelled at Tasha about wanting to lead Moroi to battle. She\u0027d called him Andrew. He tried to land a hit and failed; his technique was all wrong. \"This is the safest way. Listen to that Strigoi-lover, and we\u0027ll all be dead. She\u0027s trying to kill our whole race off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s trying to save us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s trying to get us to use black magic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"Strigoi-lover\" had to be Tasha. The non-royal guy was the first person outside of my little circle whom I\u0027d ever heard speak in her favor. I wondered how many others out there shared his view. He punched Andrew again, and my base instincts- or maybe the punch- made me leap into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprang forward and wedged myself between them. I was still dizzy and a bit unsteady. If they hadn\u0027t been standing so close, I probably would have fallen over. They both hesitated, clearly caught off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of here,\" snapped Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing male and Moroi, they had greater height and weight than I, but I was probably stronger than either one alone. Hoping I could make the most of that, I grabbed each of them by the arm, pulled them toward me, and then shoved them away as hard as I could. They staggered, not having expected my strength. I staggered a little too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe non-royal glared and took a step toward me. I was counting on the fact that he\u0027d be old-fashioned and not hit a girl. \"What are you doing?\" he exclaimed. Several people had gathered and were watching excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned his glare. \"I\u0027m trying to stop you guys from being any more idiotic than you already are! You want to help? Stop fighting each other! Ripping each other\u0027s heads off isn\u0027t going to save the Moroi unless you\u0027re trying to thin stupidity out of the gene pool.\" I pointed at Andrew. \"Tasha Ozera is not trying to kill everyone off. She\u0027s trying to get you to stop being a victim.\" I turned to the other guy. \"And as for you, you\u0027ve got a long ways to go if you think this is the way to get your point across. Magic- especially offensive magic- takes a lot of self-control, and so far, you aren\u0027t impressing me with yours. I have more than you do, and if you knew me at all, you\u0027d know how crazy that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two guys stared at me, stunned. I was apparently more effective than a taser. Well, at least for several seconds I was. Because once the shock of my words wore off, they went at each other again. I got caught in the crossfire and shoved away, nearly falling in the process. Suddenly, from behind me, Mason came to my defense. He punched the first guy he could- the non-royal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy flew backward, falling into one of the pools with a splash. I yelped, remembering my earlier fear about skull-cracking, but a moment later, he found his feet and rubbed water out of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed Mason\u0027s arm, trying to hold him back, but he shrugged me off and went after Andrew. He shoved Andrew hard, pushing him into several Moroi- andrew\u0027s friends, I suspected- who seemed to be trying to break up the fight. The guy in the pool climbed out, fury written all over his face, and made moves toward Andrew. This time, both Mason and I blocked his way. He glared at all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" I warned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy clenched his fists and looked as though he might try to take us on. But we were intimidating, and he didn\u0027t appear to have an entourage of friends here like Andrew-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who was shouting obscenities and being led away- did. With a few muttered threats, the non-royal backed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he was gone, I turned on Mason. \"Are you out of your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jumping into the middle of that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You jumped in too,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to argue, then realized he was right. \"It\u0027s different,\" I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward. \"Are you drunk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Of course not. I\u0027m just trying to keep you from doing something stupid. Just because you have delusions of being able to kill a Strigoi doesn\u0027t mean you have to take it out on everyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delusions?\" he asked stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to feel kind of nauseous just then. My head spinning, I continued toward the side room, hoping I didn\u0027t stumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I reached it, I saw that it wasn\u0027t some kind of dessert or drink room after all. Well, at least not in the way I\u0027d been thinking. It was a feeder room. Several humans reclined on satin-covered chaise lounges with Moroi by their sides. Jasmine incense burned in the air. Stunned, I watched with an eerie fascination as a blond Moroi guy leaned forward and bit into the neck of a very pretty redhead. All of these feeders were exceptionally good-looking, I realized just then. Like actresses or models. Only the best for royalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy drank long and deep, and the girl closed her eyes and parted her lips, an expression of pure bliss on her face as Moroi endorphins flooded into her bloodstream. I shivered, taken back to when I too had experienced that same kind of euphoria. In my alcohol-hazed mind, the whole thing suddenly seemed startlingly erotic. In fact, I almost felt intrusive- like I was watching people have sex. When the Moroi finished and licked the last of the blood away, he brushed his lips against her cheek in a soft kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to volunteer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight fingertips brushed my neck, and I jumped. I turned around and saw Adrian\u0027s green eyes and knowing smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do that,\" I told him, knocking his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you doing in here?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured around me. \"I\u0027m lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered at me. \"Are you drunk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Of course not...but ...\" The nausea had settled a little, but I still didn\u0027t feel right. \"I think I should sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my arm. \"Well, don\u0027t do it in here. Someone might get the wrong idea. Let\u0027s go somewhere quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steered me off into a different room, and I looked around with interest. It was a massage area. Several Moroi lay back on tables and were getting back and foot massages from hotel staff. The oil they used smelled like rosemary and lavender. Under any other circumstances, a massage would have sounded great, but lying on my stomach seemed like the worst idea just now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down on the carpeted floor, leaning back against the wall. Adrian walked away and returned with a glass of water. Sitting down as well, he handed it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink this. It\u0027ll help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I\u0027m not drunk,\" I mumbled. But I downed the water anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" He smiled at me. \"You did nice work with that fight. Who was the other guy that helped you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boyfriend,\" I said. \"Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mia was right. You do have a lot of guys in your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He was still smiling. \"Where\u0027s Vasilisa? I figured she\u0027d be attached to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s with her boyfriend.\" I studied him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with the tone? Jealous? You want him for yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, no. I just don\u0027t like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he treat her badly?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I admitted. \"He adores her. He\u0027s just kind of a jerk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian was clearly enjoying this. \"Ah, you are jealous. Does she spend more time with him than you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored that. \"Why do you keep asking about her? Are you interested in her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Rest easy, I\u0027m not interested in her in the same way I am you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left to fetch me more water. \"Feeling better?\" he asked, handing the glass to me. It was crystal and intricately carved. It seemed too fancy for plain water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah ... I didn\u0027t think those drinks were that strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the beauty of them,\" he chuckled. \"And speaking of beauty ... that\u0027s a great color on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted. I might not have been showing as much skin as those other girls, but I was showing more than I really wanted to with Adrian. Or was I? There was something weird about him. His arrogant manner annoyed me...but I still liked being around him. Maybe the smartass in me recognized a kindred spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the back of my drunken mind, a light clicked on. But I couldn\u0027t quite get to it. I drank more water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t had a cigarette in, like, ten minutes,\" I pointed out, wanting to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face. \"No smoking in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve made up for it in punch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile returned. \"Well, some of us can hold our liquor. You aren\u0027t going to be sick, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still felt tipsy but no longer nauseous. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought back to when I\u0027d dreamed about him. It had been just a dream, but it had stuck with me, particularly the talk about me being surrounded in darkness. I wanted to ask him about it... even though I knew it was stupid. It had been my dream, not his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his green eyes on me. \"Yes, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t bring myself to ask. \"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to retort, then tilted his head toward the door. \"Ah, here she comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa stepped into the room, eyes scanning around. When she spotted us, I saw relief break over her. I couldn\u0027t feel it, though. Intoxicants like alcohol numbed the bond. It was another reason I shouldn\u0027t have taken such a stupid chance tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are,\" she said, kneeling beside me. Glancing at Adrian, she gave him a nod. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey yourself, cousin,\" he returned, using the family terms royals sometimes used around each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Lissa asked me. \"When I saw how drunk you were, I thought you might have fallen in somewhere and drowned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not- \" I gave up trying to deny it. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian\u0027s usual expression had turned serious as he studied Lissa. It again reminded me of the dream. \"How\u0027d you find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa gave him a puzzled look. \"I, um, checked all the rooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" He looked disappointed. \"I thought you might have used your bond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth she and I stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about that?\" I demanded. Only a few people at school knew about it. Adrian had spoken about it as casually as he might have my hair color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I can\u0027t reveal all my secrets, can I?\" he asked mysteriously. \"And besides, there\u0027s a certain way you two act around each other ... it\u0027s hard to explain. It\u0027s pretty cool... all the old myths are true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa regarded him warily. \"The bond only works one way. Rose can sense what I\u0027m feeling and thinking, but I can\u0027t do it back to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" We sat in silence a few moments, and I drank more water. Adrian spoke again. \"What\u0027d you specialize in anyway, cousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked embarrassed. We both knew it was important to keep her spirit powers secret from others who might abuse her healing, but her cover story of not having specialized always bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they think you\u0027re going to? Late bloomer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably higher in the other elements, though, right? Just not strong enough to really master any?\" He reached out to pat her shoulder in an exaggerated show of comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, how\u0027d you- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant his fingers touched her, she gasped. It was as though a bolt of lightning had struck her. The strangest look crossed her face. Even drunk, I felt the flood of joy that came pouring through the bond. She stared at Adrian in wonder. His eyes were locked onto hers too. I didn\u0027t understand why they were looking at each other like that, but it bothered me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said. \"Stop that. I told you, she has a boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said, still watching her. A small smile turned his lips. \"We need to have a chat someday, cousin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" I was more confused than ever. \"You have a boyfriend. And there he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked back to reality. All three of us turned toward the doorway. Christian and the others stood there. I suddenly had a flashback to when they\u0027d found me with Adrian\u0027s arm around me. This wasn\u0027t much better. Lissa and I were sitting on either side of him, very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprang up, looking mildly guilty. Christian was regarding her curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re getting ready to leave,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she told him. She looked down at me. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and started to clamber to my feet. Adrian caught my arm as I did and helped me up. He smiled at Lissa. \"Nice talking to you.\" To me, he murmured very quietly, \"Don\u0027t worry. I told you, I\u0027m not interested in her in that way. She doesn\u0027t look as good in a bathing suit. Probably not as good out of one either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my arm away. \"Well, you\u0027ll never find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"I have a good imagination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the others, and we headed back toward the main part of the lodge. Mason gave me as strange a look as Christian had given Lissa and stayed away from me, walking toward the front with Eddie. To my surprise and discomfort, I found myself walking beside Mia. She looked miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I\u0027m really sorry about what happened,\" I said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to act like you care, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I mean it. It\u0027s horrible...I\u0027m so sorry.\" She wouldn\u0027t look at me. \"Is...that is, are you going to see your dad soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever they have the memorial,\" she said stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what else to say and gave up, instead turning my attention to the stairs as we climbed back up to the lodge\u0027s main level. Unexpectedly, Mia was the one who continued the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watched you break up that fight ...\" she said slowly. \"You mentioned offensive magic. Like you knew about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Great. She was going to make a play at blackmail...or was she? At the moment, she seemed almost civil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just guessing,\" I said. No way was I going to bust Tasha and Christian. \"I don\u0027t really know that much. Just stories I\u0027ve heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Her face fell. \"What kind of stories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, well...\"I tried to think of something neither too vague nor too specific. \"Like I told those guys...the concentration thing is big. Because if you\u0027re in a battle with Strigoi, all sorts of things can distract you. So you\u0027ve got to keep control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was actually a basic guardian rule, but it must have been new to Mia. Her eyes widened with eagerness. \"What else? What kind of spells do people use?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t really even know how spells work, and like I said, these are just...stories I\u0027ve heard. My guess is you just find ways to use your element as a weapon. Like ... fire users really have an advantage because fire\u0027ll kill Strigoi, so it\u0027s easy for them. And air users can suffocate people.\" I\u0027d actually experienced that last one vicariously through Lissa. It had been horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia\u0027s eyes grew wider still. \"What about a water user?\" she asked. \"How could water hurt a Strigoi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused. \"I, uh, never heard any stories about water users. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any ideas, though? Ways that, like, someone like me could learn to fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh. So that\u0027s what this was about. It actually wasn\u0027t all that crazy. I remembered how excited she\u0027d looked at the meeting when Tasha had talked about attacking Strigoi. Mia wanted to take revenge on the Strigoi for her mother\u0027s death. No wonder she and Mason had been getting along so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mia,\" I said gently, catching hold of the door to let her pass. We were almost at the lobby now. \"I know how you must want to ... do something. But I think you\u0027re better off just sort of letting yourself, um, grieve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reddened, and suddenly, I was seeing the normal and angry Mia. \"Don\u0027t talk down to me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m serious. I\u0027m just saying you shouldn\u0027t do anything rash while you\u0027re still upset. Besides ...\" I bit off my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe narrowed her eyes. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew it. She needed to know. \"Well, I don\u0027t really know what good a water user would be against a Strigoi. It\u0027s probably the least useful element to use on one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutrage filled her features. \"You\u0027re a real bitch, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just telling you the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let me tell you the truth. You\u0027re a total idiot when it comes to guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Dimitri. She wasn\u0027t entirely off base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mason\u0027s great,\" she continued. \"One of the nicest guys I know- and you don\u0027t even notice! He\u0027d do anything for you, and you were off throwing yourself at Adrian Ivashkov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words surprised me. Could Mia have a crush on Mason? And while I certainly hadn\u0027t been throwing myself at Adrian, I could see how it might have looked that way. And even if it weren\u0027t true, that wouldn\u0027t have stopped Mason from feeling hurt and betrayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia stared at me, so astonished I\u0027d agreed with her that she didn\u0027t say anything else for the rest of the walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the part of the lodge that split off into different wings for guys and girls. I grabbed a hold of Mason\u0027s arm as the others walked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on,\" I told him. I badly needed to reassure him about Adrian, but a tiny part of me wondered if I was doing it because I actually wanted Mason or because I just liked the idea of him wanting me and selfishly didn\u0027t want to lose that. He stopped and looked at me. His face was wary. \"I wanted to tell you I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have yelled at you after the fight- I know you were just trying to help. And with Adrian...nothing happened. I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t look that way,\" Mason said. But the anger on his face had faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but believe me, it\u0027s all him. He\u0027s got some kind of stupid crush on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tone must have been convincing because Mason smiled. \"Well. Hard not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested in him,\" I continued. \"Or anyone else.\" It was a small lie, but I didn\u0027t think it mattered just then. I was going to be over Dimitri soon, and Mia had been right about Mason. He was wonderful and sweet and cute. I would be an idiot not to pursue this ... right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand was still on his arm, and I pulled him toward me. He didn\u0027t need much more of a signal. He leaned down and kissed me, and in the process, I found myself pressed up against the wall- very much like with Dimitri in the practice room. Of course, it felt nothing like how it had with Dimitri, but it was still nice in its way. I put my arms around Mason and started to pull him closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could go ... somewhere,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed back and laughed. \"Not when you\u0027re drunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not... that... drunk anymore,\" I said, trying to pull him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving me a small kiss on the lips, he stepped back. \"Drunk enough. Look, this isn\u0027t easy, believe me. But if you still want me tomorrow- when you\u0027re sober- then we\u0027ll talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned down and kissed me again. I tried to wrap my arms around him, but he broke away once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy there, girl,\" he teased, backing toward his hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him, but he only laughed and turned around. As he walked away, my glare faded, and I headed back to my room with a smile on my face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-15.html","bookId":2061,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM"}
