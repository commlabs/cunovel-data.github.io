He was the third child of seven (three sisters and three brothers).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was described as a precocious child who obeyed his parents, had wild black hair, dark brown eyes, and an unwavering stare that unnerved most teachers and classmates alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father was a dairy farmer with no criminal record, no military background, and followed the Quaker faith with no particular zeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother was arrested once at the age of twenty-one for protesting taxes (released on one-year parole), and both her grandfathers served in the Rain Forest Wars (one surviving, received the Bronze Star—see attached report on Captain Oliver Franks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting in 2310, exploration and colony ships were built, and the best and brightest people left the safety of the Earth to make their way to the stars. This was the “Golden Age” of colonial expansion from Earth. Within 180 years, the main human colonies had been established—some becoming huge population and commerce centers such as Reach, while others would remain tiny manufacturing outposts. This collection of “close” worlds would later be called the Inner Colonies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Inner Colonies provided a surplus of raw goods, materials, and taxes that flooded back to the parent government on Earth. For most it was a time of plenty, optimism, and indolence unparalleled since second-century Rome or the financial bubble at the end of twentieth-century America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Cole family, however, tax records show his family struggling to make ends meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston Cole’s Fifth Grade Report Card\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMissouri Rain River School District\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace Fujikawa Elementary School\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomeroom Teacher: Dr. Lillian Bratton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston J.

A boy of high natural intellect, he tends to work too hard even when he plays. He overanalyzes every strategy when he plays baseball, slowing the games to a crawl. If he does not know how to do something, he looks it up, or if possible derives it (in the case of Mr. Martin‘s pre-algebra class) from first principles. These traits in and of themselves are admirable, but he also needs to cultivate his imagination. In short, Preston never seems to have fun. Everything is a task to be finished. Preston also falls asleep in class on a regular basis; I would suggest that his chores or responsibilities at home be relaxed. He is, after all, only ten years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfidential Note: Wallace Fujikawa Elementary School\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edatabase / March 12, 2481 (Military Calendar)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident in Mr. Martin‘s pre-algebra class has been settled. A makeup final exam has been given, and Preston was carefully monitored the entire time. He produced another perfect test score, proving to William (Mr. Martin) that he did not cheat, although a perfect score (let alone two perfect scores) is a feat that has never been accomplished on the standardized pre-algebra final.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston‘s father continues to defend his son‘s driven nature and his family‘s antiquated beliefs, insisting that Preston‘s education at home has far and away exceeded what is taught at school.

Cole (age 14)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreshman English / Miss Alexander\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrade received: B\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Teacher‘s comments: ―Thesis: B / Conclusions: C / Too much speculation and gratuitous use of Yeats quotation\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe metaphor of a biological system, for example a population of wolves or fungus growth in a Petri dish, is tempting to apply to colonial expansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere can be three fates for any biological system. It may grow as long as there are sufficient nutrients, a suitable environment, and no over-predation—the system can enter a balance state of growth and loss—or the system may decline from over-predation, lack of nutrients, environmental disaster, or being poisoned by its own waste products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff-world colonies similarly require a stable environment with suitable food and water, and no over-predation. It is considered an open system because there are limitless numbers of habitable planets. (Or at least a very large number within the Milky Way Galaxy. See my Drake calculation assumptions in Appendix B.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman colonies, however, differ in one critical aspect: they are, by rule, inhabited by predictably intelligent entities. The values of these entities can diverge from the parent world with each successive generation. That is, while colonies directly seeded from Earth remain very earthlike in social, economic, and political values, they change with successive generations as they adapt to local environmental pressures, and in turn send out new colonies farther in physical distance and values from the original parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch diversification in biological systems is a normal evolutionary process, but it produces offspring that are increasingly alien in nature to the parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch was the case of colonial expansion in early Earth history, most notably in the British colonies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Those colonies diverged from their parent nations and their resulting different social and economic values culminated in a schism, and in one notable case a war that resulted in a shift in the balance of power, such that one former colony became the dominant military, cultural and industrial complex on Earth for hundreds of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long can Earth and its close colonies extend without producing offspring that differ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esufficiently to want to break away from the parent? As William Butler Yeats said: ―The center cannot hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eANALYSIS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cole family farm was an anomaly. Most small Earth farms couldn‘t compete with colonial\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagro-corporations that could produce ten times the yield on worlds with constant sunlight and volcanic alluvial soils. The Cole farm, however, still exists (after eight generations) and continues to operate. This family instilled a no-nonsense work ethic and discipline in Preston Cole that made him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―anachronistic\" in comparison to the population at the time who were enjoying the benefits of the still-expansive colonial era and whose most noteworthy ability was a sense of entitlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it also gave Preston Cole a clarity which many at the time lacked. Reading his freshman essay, one cannot help but think that this must be a fabrication of ONI Section-II, a remnant fiction from an earlier propaganda campaign. And yet, it has been verified as legitimate. What would Cole have become had his teacher shared even a fraction of his insight and encouraged it? This boy whom the elementary teacher decried as lacking ―imagination\" was damn near prophetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole‘s grades, however, continually slipped in high school—we assume from the boredom of the standardized coursework and the increasing demands of his life on the farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo journals have been found from his adolescent years, and it is doubtful that his family situation would encourage such activities, so we‘re forced to speculate on his aspirations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole was surrounded by a world of excesses and opportunities that were just out of his reach. He was highly intelligent, but had no creative outlet. Given the mass media‘s predilection for romanticizing off-world adventures at that time, Cole may have seen the colonies and stellar exploration as an irresistible opportunity which he could not pass up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven his limited economic means and lack of excellence within the templates and strictures of a standardized educational system, there was only one way for him to seek his fortune off-world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECTION TWO: NONCOMMISSIONED YEARS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2488–2489 CE)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policy at that time was to allow any college graduate or promising student out of high school with superior grades (or the right connections) to enter prestigious military colleges that virtually guaranteed a commission upon graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe requirement of mandatory noncommissioned field experience before application to officer training schools was instituted only later, when it became clear that such officers would be responsible for irreplaceable military assets and personnel—and, in the Covenant War, the lives of millions of civilians on the worlds they protected. Preston Cole was one of the first admirals to implement such a policy, saying, “Those not bloodied in combat have no business leading men and women into battle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe just-graduated Preston Cole (age eighteen) had neither the grades nor the connections to attend such officer training academies. So he enlisted as a noncommissioned recruit in the Navy. He was ordered to Unified Combined Military Boot Camp (UCMB), and then shipped up-elevator for six additional weeks of vacuum and microgravity training (colloquially known, then, as now, as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“barf school”). Upon his graduation as Crewman Recruit Cole he was ordered aboard the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCMA Season of Plenty, assigned to atmospheric reclamation maintenance duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e{Excerpt} Preston J.
