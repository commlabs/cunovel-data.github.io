(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lion Prince’s overbearing aura was ferocious and unstoppable. Gripping Zhou Weiqing by the neck, the light in his eyes was gleaming with a murderous light, but he just said coldly: “I will not kill you today. Do you know why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, at this point, Zhou Weiqing was being gripped tightly by the neck and could not speak at all, naturally unable to give an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is because Tian’er’s heart has already returned to me. Killing you would only dirty my hands. This is a letter for you from Tian’er…” As he said that, a light flashed in his hands, and a letter appeared. Shoving it forward, he slammed it into Zhou Weiqing’s chest, where it stuck to the matted blood there. Next, he let go, and Zhou Weiqing’s body crumpled to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For Tian’er’s sake, I will let you go once. After all, she once liked you. However, if you let me see you again, I will rip you into shreds…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, Gu YingBing gave Zhou Weiqing a final kick, sending him flying back a dozen yards like a sack of rubbish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go.” Gu YingBing glared a final, slightly unwilling, time at the critically injured Zhou Weiqing. Waving his hands towards his two guards, he turned back and headed to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior Brother, I beg you please, I beg you. Do not kill him. I… I am willing to marry you, as long as you let him go free, alright? Otherwise, you will only get my dead body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“.......”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior Brother, I am willing to write him a letter, to let him know that I no longer love him, so that he will give up on me. In future, I will be yours, a good wife, taking good care of you. Please, I beg you. This is my last request. After all, I once loved him, and I do not want him to die because of me. Senior Brother, please, I beg you, let him go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last… “Alright. But you must do what you said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior Brother, then you must swear not to kill him. I will not see him again in the future as well...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu YingBing was after all a Prince, and he naturally would not do something like breaking his own word to the woman he loved. No matter how much he wanted to, he finally did not land the final killing blow. Despite his unwilling feelings, he finally left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty!!” Shangguan Fei’er flew to Zhou Weiqing. Alas, even though she finally reached him, she dared not touch him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s current look was extremely scary. Both his arms and left leg were clearly broken, twisted in a weird position. Blood was pouring out of all his orifices, and his chest was slightly caved in, some of his ribs and clavicle clearly broken as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at him like that, Shangguan Fei’er felt as if her heart was in such pain, almost not being able to breathe. She did not even know how to help him, not even daring to infuse Heavenly Energy into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty… Little Fatty…” She called out softly, tears streaming down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing slowly opened his eyes. They were full of anger, hate, regret and unwilling. He had lost, lost so easily to his own love rival, perhaps even losing Tian’er. The pain in his heart far surpassed the pain in his body. In fact, as his injuries were just too critical, he currently felt his entire body numb, and actually did not feel much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fei’er… open… the… letter… on… my… chest… and… read… it… to me…” Zhou Weiqing barely croaked out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are already like this, and you still want to look at some letter? You stupid playboy, if not for that, how could you…” Shangguan Fei’er almost wanted to give him another beating of her own at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Read it to me…” Zhou Weiqing’s eyes opened wide, his pale lips trembling as he said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Shangguan Fei’er could not bear to disregard his request, and she carefully picked up the letter from his chest, soaked with his blood. Opening the envelop, she took out a thin piece of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a quick glance at it, her face changed, and a hesitant expression flashed across her beautiful features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What…” Zhou Weiqing said with a trembling voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er bit her lip lightly before finally reading it out softly: “Little Fatty, when you read this letter, it is over between us. Forget about me. I realised that the person I truly love is Big Bro Gu after all, and we are about to be married. What happened in the past is me being young, foolish and rebellious, just too curious about the world that I had never seen before. I do not truly love you. This year, in the coldest day of winter, I will become Big Bro Gu’s wife. We will not meet again, farewell forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not easy for her to finish reading such a paragraph, and by the time she finished, Shangguan Fei’er flew into a rage, ripping the letter into shreds as she said: “What an undevoted and unfaithful slut…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha…” To Shangguan Fei’er’s surprise, when Zhou Weiqing heard her read the letter, he did not grow angry at all. Instead, the bloodshot eyes slowly turned back to his normal colour, the red slowly ebbing out, and even the spirit slowly returned to his eyes as he laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laugh… you’re still laughing…” Shangguan Fei’er stared at him dazedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing continued laughing heartily and said: “Why… why can’t I laugh… Tian’er… how could she… possibly… love… that… Lion Prince… Look, she… is… still… calling me… Little Fatty… she is still...calling… me... Little Fatty… she still … cares… for me… She is just… afraid… that… Gu… YingBing… kills me… that’s why… she wrote… that on purpose. Her… heart… is still… with me… Coldest day...of winter… that is...my last… chance...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, Shangguan Fei’er did not see any dejection or discouragement from the loss to the Lion Prince, instead an even stronger fighting spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really wonder what your heart is made of. You are already so terribly injured, and you can still think about fighting for women.” Since Zhou Weiqing seemed to have come out of his internal pain, Shangguan Fei’er also heaved a sigh of relief. She had been afraid that Zhou Weiqing would not be able to recover from such a huge fall. As she spoke now, her words almost seemed to have a slightly sour tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked with dove eyes at Shangguan Fei’er, his low, raspy voice saying: “You all… are my… most precious… I am willing… to pit my all… to sacrifice myself… for each and every… one of you…” His voice grew lower and lower, until he finally fell into a dead faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were speaking, Lin TianAo had taken out two long staves and some cloth from his Spatial Ring, fashioning a crude stretcher. The way Zhou Weiqing looked currently, it was vital that he was moved carefully and that his wounds were not shaken too much. It was best to bring him back to the Peerless Battalion as quickly as possible, but riding a horse would be impossible for Zhou Weiqing, even if he were conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, the Northwestern armies been deployed and were advancing to face the enemies. However, as they moved out, the returning Peerless Battalion had met them not far out, escorting the two powerful tribes back. Shen Ji had learned a single piece of news from the Peerless Battalion - the enemy had been repelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he could also clearly see that the Peerless Battalion had actually brought back several thousand Unicorn Heavenly Beasts!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding these Unicorn Heavenly Beasts, gaining them was a total delight for the Berserker Tribe, as it would be a great boon to them. These Unicorn Heavenly Beasts were considered horse type beasts, and the Berserker Tribes had inherited many ways to tame and train such horse-type Heavenly Beasts since ancient times. Although these Unicorns were not yet tamed, since their entire Tribe was mobilized to migrate away, they were confident in eventually doing so. Such stout and powerful Unicorn Heavenly Beasts, how could the Berserker Tribe Leader Ma Long let them go so easily. With the Berserker Tribe’s special whistling technique, they were able to gather the Unicorns which had fled in all directions before heading to the Peerless Battalion camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the two tribes, they numbered more than ten thousand in total, entering the Peerless Battalion camp. Shen Ji had been a little worried at first, after all, what if any of those were spies? Just as he was hesitating whether or not they had to examine all their backgrounds individually, the Peerless Battalion had given him a tight slap on his face indeed. The First Main Company of the Peerless Battalion had brought along two thousand heads to exchange for prizes. This was even after they had been forced to leave in a hurry and had not finished looting and gathering all the heads of their fallen enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two thousand heads were mostly of the Unicorn Beastmen Tribe, and that in itself spoke volumes. More importantly, Shen Ji realised that the Peerless Battalion had not suffered any losses themselves!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCould it be that teacher of Zhou Weiqing’s had taken action?! \u003c/i\u003eUpon thinking about the mysterious teacher of Zhou Weiqing’s, Shen Ji dispelled his own misgivings, heading back to the northwestern command to report about what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Zhou Weiqing’s teacher had not taken action at all. In fact, currently, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was in the midst of a violent rage...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Zhou Weiqing lying on the bed in front of him, half dead and still unconscious, Long Shiya was so angry that his entire body was trembling. Lin TianAo and Shangguan Fei’er stood by the side, and they could vaguely see that six lights were reverberating around Long Shiya’s body. As they were standing rather close, the terrifying pressure emanating from him caused their breathing to become extremely difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter bringing Zhou Weiqing back, the first thing Shangguan Fei’er did was to rush to Long Shiya and interrupt him from his cultivation in the camp. She knew that with Zhou Weiqing’s critical injuries, only Long Shiya and his powerful cultivation level would be able to help him recover as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-160-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-161-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-161-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
