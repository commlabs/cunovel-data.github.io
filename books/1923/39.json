gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thanks for yesterday, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark eyes were warm with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re here today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed a smile, despite feeling all twisted up and achy inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was right in my world when things weren\u0027t right between me and Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catch me up on what I missed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning passed swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a checklist of follow-ups waiting from the week before, and Mark had an eleven thirty deadline to turn around a request for proposal for a promotional items manufacturer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we sent the RFP off, I was back in the groove and willing to just forget Gideon\u0027s mood that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if he\u0027d had another nightmare and hadn\u0027t slept well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided call him when lunchtime rolled around, just in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I checked my inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Google alert I\u0027d set up for Gideon\u0027s name was waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the e-mail hoping to get an idea of what he might be working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words former fiancee in some of the headlines leaped out at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knot I\u0027d had in my gut earlier returned, tighter than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clicked on the first link, and it took me to a gossip blog sporting pictures of Gideon and Corinne having dinner at Tableau One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat close together in the front window, her hand resting intimately on his forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing the suit he\u0027d worn to the hospital the day before, but I checked the date anyway, desperately hoping the photos were old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy palms began to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tortured myself by clicking through all the links and studying every photo I found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smiling in a few of them, looking remarkably content for a man whose girlfriend was at a hospital with her beaten-half-to-death best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like throwing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr storming up to Gideon\u0027s office and asking him what the hell was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d blown me off when I\u0027d called him the night before - to go to dinner with his ex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped when my desk phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked it up and woodenly recited, \"Mark Garrity\u0027s office, Eva Tramell speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Megumi in reception, sounding as bubbly as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s someone asking for you downstairs -\u0026nbsp; Brett Kline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there for a long minute, letting that sink into my fevered brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forwarded the alert digest to Gideon\u0027s e-mail so he\u0027d know that I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I said, \"I\u0027ll be right down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * * I saw Brett in the lobby the minute I pushed through the security turnstiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore black jeans and a Six-Ninths T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunglasses hid his eyes, but the spiky hair with its bleached tips was eye-catching, as was his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett was tall and muscular, more muscular than Gideon, who was powerful without any bulk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett\u0027s hands came out of his pockets when he saw me coming, his posture straightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at my cap-sleeved dress with its flattering ruching and acknowledged that he\u0027d never seen me dressed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re still in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore surprised that he\u0027d looked me up, but I didn\u0027t say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad he had, because I\u0027d been worried about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sold out our Jones Beach show over the weekend, then played the Meadowlands last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skipped out on the guys because I wanted to see you before we head south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched for you online, found out where you worked, and came up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood old Google, I thought miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so stoked that everything\u0027s working out for you now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have time to grab lunch?\" \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer came quickly and fervently, which set off a little warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pissed, extremely hurt, and eager to retaliate against Gideon, but I didn\u0027t want to mislead Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I couldn\u0027t resist taking him to the restaurant where Cary and I had once been photographed together, in the hopes of getting caught by the paparazzi again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would serve Gideon right to see what it felt like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the cab ride over, Brett asked about Cary and wasn\u0027t surprised to learn that my best friend had moved across the country with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two were always inseparable,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except when he was getting laid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell him I said hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mention that Cary was in the hospital, because it felt too private to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until we were seated in the restaurant that Brett took off his shades, so that was the first time I got a glimpse of the shiner that encompassed the area from his right eyebrow down to his cheekbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I breathed, wincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makeup made it disappear on stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you\u0027ve seen me with worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, I got a couple good hits in, didn\u0027t I?\" Remembering the bruising on Gideon\u0027s jaw and back, I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused as the waiter came by and dropped off two glasses and a chilled bottle of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dating Gideon Cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered why that question always seemed to pop up at a time when I wasn\u0027t sure the relationship would last another minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been seeing each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it serious?\" \"Sometimes it seems that way,\" I said honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you seeing anyone?\" \"Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took some time to read the menu and place our orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant was busy and noisy, the background music barely heard over the hum of conversation and clatter of plates from the nearby kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked across the table at each other, sizing one another up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the thrum of attraction between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue, I knew he was aware of it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you write \u0027Golden\u0027?\" I asked suddenly, unable to hold back my curiosity a moment longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been playing it off as nothing big with both Gideon and Cary, but it was driving me crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett sat back in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I think about you a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t stop thinking about you actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had it going on for six months, Eva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the longest I\u0027ve ever been with someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we weren\u0027t with each other,\" I argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aside from sexually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth thinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand what I was to you, but that doesn\u0027t mean I didn\u0027t get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him for a long minute, my heart beating too quickly in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like I\u0027m stoned or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way I remember it, we\u0027d hook up after shows, then you\u0027d go about your business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I wasn\u0027t there to put out, you\u0027d grab someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried getting you to hang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was always asking you to stick around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a couple of quick, deep breaths to calm myself down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hardly believe that now, almost four years too late, Brett Kline was talking to me like I\u0027d once wanted him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were out in public together, having a meal, almost like a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was messing with my head, which was already confused and scattered because of Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had the biggest crush on you, Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote your name with little hearts around it like a lovesick teenager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted desperately to be your girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding me?\" He reached out and caught my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck happened, then?\" I looked down at where he was absently twirling the ring Gideon had given me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember when we went to the pool hall?\" \"Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I forget that?\" He bit his lower lip, clearly recalling how I\u0027d fucked his brains out in the back of his car, determined to be the best lay he\u0027d ever had so he wouldn\u0027t bother with other girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we were getting to the point where we\u0027d start seeing each other outside the bar, but you ditched me the minute we got inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to the bathroom,\" I said quietly, remembering the pain and embarrassment as if the incident had just happened, \"and when I came out you and Darrin were at the change machine getting quarters for the tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour back was to me so you didn\u0027t see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard you guys talking .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand laughing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled in a deep breath and tugged my hand away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his credit, Brett shifted in obvious embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t remember exactly what was said, but .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, Eva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was twenty-one years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe band was just starting to get popular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chicks were everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d been with you a few times by then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBringing you along to the pool hall made a statement to the guys that things were picking up between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed at his brow in a very familiar gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t have the balls to own up to how I was feeling about you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it about the sex, but that wasn\u0027t true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my glass and drank, forcing down the lump in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand dropped onto the armrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I screwed it up with my big mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why you bailed that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why you never went anywhere with me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was desperate, Brett,\" I admitted, \"but I didn\u0027t want to show it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter brought our food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered why I\u0027d ordered anything - I was too unsettled to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett started cutting into his steak, attacking it really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, he set his knife and fork down.
