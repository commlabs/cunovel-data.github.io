It is a card that urges concentration and focus, lest your goal be lost. And I suppose that’s meaningless, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fortune-teller’s hand hovered over the spread. Impulsively, she pulled another card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Asking a question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought it was foolish to read one’s own cards.” Josephine repeated something Agatha had told her once before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a question for myself,” she said, turning it over. “A question for you. Ah. The Magician.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that’s somebody I could use, right about now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgatha shook her head. “In this case, I think he stands for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because as you said, I know you so well.” She smiled and leaned forward, pretending to explain some arcane bit of divination, but only leaning in so that even the closest observer might not overhear. “You believe Madame Laveau? You do not think she made the zombis, or controls them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She says they Walk through no magic of hers. But she controlled them a bit. I saw her do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not think she was lying, and I do not think her control is absolute. Nor,” she added quickly, “do I think any magic is involved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did she control them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine hesitated. “I should say instead that she stopped them. She stunned them, with a very loud noise, and something about it … the timbre of it, or the tone. Something made them all stand still. But I don’t know if I could repeat her success, and I would not dare to try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s wise of you, to defer to her judgment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe in magic. I don’t believe in cards, or curses. But I believe that Madame Marie has power, and I have no interest in offending her. Besides, she saved me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believe that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that,” she confirmed. “I was trapped between the dead and the alligators, and she intervened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then she wants something from you,” Agatha said coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever it is, she can have it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fortune-teller retrieved her cards again, and resumed her slow shuffling. “If I were you, I’d be careful what I promised to the little queen. I would not offend her myself, but beware of what you offer unbidden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does that advice come from your cards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it comes from my heart—one old friend to another: Be careful of her motives, and the favors she asks of you. I believe she means well for the city, but also that she leans quite hard on the ends justifying the means. At any rate, look: you’ve used up all your tarot time, which will come as a relief, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine heard the rolling-crawlers before she saw them. She’d know them anywhere; she listened to them for the last three nights patrolling beneath the Garden Court windows every hour on the hour as the curfew that seized the city was forced into effect. Ostensibly, this new measure was meant to address the disappearance of Colonel Betters and Lieutenant Cardiff four days previously, and just this once, Josephine didn’t doubt the Texians and their sincerity. They wanted to know what had happened to their officers, and they didn’t understand anything about the Dead Who Walk, the “zombis” whose population had risen so much over the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to blame them, except that they’d failed so thoroughly to listen. Anyone could’ve told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people who worked the docks, who managed the piers, who loaded and unloaded cargo both virtuous and clandestine. The men who drove the ferries over the river, who worked the engines on the little flat boats that carried people across the bayous and into the islands in the bays; the women who separated shells from seafood in the old canneries, who mended the nets down by the shore under the heat of the sun reflected off the river, and off the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could’ve asked the rich children who were warned by bedtime stories about the zombis, or the poor children who were threatened with zombi punishment when they misbehaved. They might have asked the old folks who knew to shutter their homes against the dead as if against a storm; or they could have inquired after the young folks, who were fast enough to run and knew all the ways of escape from the in-between world down by the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone in the city could’ve said, “Yes, the men-shaped things Walk the shores and roam the abandoned spots where no one else dares to go. They moan and cough, and chase and bite. They kill, and you’d best be leaving them alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Texians had largely kept to their barracks and bases, and they did not ask about the occasional soldier or sailor who went missing … and later, perhaps, was seen again in a terribly transformed state. Desertions were not so very rare, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, the occupation had become a stable and sedentary thing. The men on top of the command chain ignored the citizens’ complaints, just as they ignored Marie Laveau and her church, and her graveyard pastimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything out of sight can be ignored, when knowing the whole story is too much trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Colonel Betters and Lieutenant Cardiff were gone, or worse than that—and if anyone but Josephine knew precisely what had become of them, no one was saying. If any bodies had been found, no one had honored them with a public burial. If anyone Walked, no one was speaking of it. Instead, the Texians went to ground like frightened animals, enforcing old rules and instituting new ones to keep people indoors at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so the rolling-crawlers came puttering on their diesel engines, around the corners and through the alleys toward the Square in front of the Saint Louis cathedral. The last of the determined fortune-tellers and corner preachers and salesmen offering boiled crawdads or knuckles of sugarcane, everyone who’d insisted on staying until the final moment … they all admitted defeat, and grumbling, they put away their stalls, their makeshift stands, and their wares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rolling-crawlers were called such because they patrolled on hard-rubber wheels that bounded independently of one another on floating axles, allowing the carriage-sized craft to climb forward over curbs and navigate the narrow streets of the old Gulf city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both better and worse than horse-drawn affairs. Better because they left no manure. Worse because they were louder, and the diesel stink of their exhalations polluted the damp, heavy air—which locked on to the best and worst of odors, keeping all smells close to the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fortune-teller said, “There’s the new fellow. He came tonight, after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard he only just arrived yesterday,” Josephine replied, scanning the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two days ago,” Agatha corrected. “I’ll say this for the Texians: They replace their own fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope they don’t replace Cardiff anytime soon.” Josephine rose to her feet and stretched, then began to help her friend break down the little station from which she earned most of her living. “I won’t be too brokenhearted if there’s no one to focus on a certain lake project anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wouldn’t break my heart either, but I won’t hold my breath. I hear Travis McCoy is more trouble than two Cardiffs and a mule. He’ll be patrolling for your prize”—she used her preferred euphemism—“sooner rather than later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine asked, “Where is he? Do you know what he looks like?” She held a hand up over her eyes, shielding them from the last of the sun’s setting glare as it bounced off the windows on the far side of the Square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over there.” Agatha tossed her head, indicating a large rolling-crawler, painted Texas dun. “Yellow-haired maniac atop the biggest brownie. That’s him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know, if he only got here the other night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s the only one I don’t recognize. The rest of these lads”—she waved in the general direction of all four corners—“I’ve seen before. Not closing down for curfew, but around the Quarter. Besides, he’s the only man being driven around, like the machine is his private cabriolet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was young for a man sent to marshal a city, probably the madam’s own age—if not younger—and he was lean inside a uniform that fit him well, and was buttoned up to the top despite the early evening warmth. He had the ramrod posture of a lifelong military peg, and the lantern jaw of someone who ought to be twice his size, though the fluffy reddish-blonde beard made his exact lines hard to determine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven what could be seen of his face, Colonel Travis McCoy possessed the kind of bone structure that’s considered “strong” on a man, and would be “unfortunate” on a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Josephine and Agatha closed up shop and sneaked glances at the rumbling machines as they puttered around the Square, the colonel lifted an amplifier to his mouth. He said something, but the words weren’t loud enough and no one heard him. He fiddled with the electric coils and turned a dial, then tried it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time his voice bellowed out—boosted by a handheld device shaped like a witch’s hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ladies and gentlemen, I can see that most of you are in the process of wrapping up your daily business, and I thank you for your promptness.” His accent leaned toward the higher-class end of the Texian spectrum. He sounded like he’d had an education someplace else, but exactly where, Josephine couldn’t pinpoint. “I do apologize for the inconvenience, and would like to remind you that this is for your own safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like hell it is,” she grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush now,” Agatha urged. “At least he’s being polite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care if he hands out five-dollar bills while he brushes my hair and calls me sweetheart, he’s closing down the Square for no good reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m trying to look on the bright side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a bright side?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgatha folded up her scarves, wrapped her cards, and gathered all the small things that were part of her trade. She then placed them inside the overturned box-table and picked it up. “There might be. Think about it this way: New Orleans has a zombi problem. It’s also occupied by the most heavily armed military in the world, and now that military is on alert. It’s a long way to go for a glimmer of light, but if nothing else good ever comes of Texas squatting here, I’d be glad if they can clear the dead out of the in-between, down by the river.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3/page-16.html","bookId":1669,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 PM"}
