Somehow, all you believers, I doubt that was in your prayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Brullyg had few allies in this chamber. Balm’s source of lust, this Captain Shurq Elalle of the privateer Undying Gratitude, and her first mate, Skorgen Kaban the Pretty. And neither seemed eager to leap to Brullyg’s side of the sandpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that Shurq, she was damned watchful. Probably a lot more dangerous than the usurper of this cruddy island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct had been explaining, in decent traders’ tongue, the new rules of governance on Second Maiden Fort, and with each statement Brullyg’s expression had sagged yet further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntertaining, if one was inclined towards sardonic humour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ships from our fleet,’ she was now explaining, ‘will be entering the harbour to resupply. One at a time, since it wouldn’t do to panic your citizens-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snort from Shurq Elalle, who had drawn her chair to one side, almost in front of where Throatslitter leaned against the wall, to permit herself a clear view of host and guests. Beside her, Skorgen was filling his prodigious gut with Brullyg’s favourite ale, the tankard in one hand, the finger of the other hand exploring the depths of one mangled, rose-red ear. The man had begun a succession of belches, each released in a heavy sigh, that had been ongoing for half a bell now, with no sign of ending. The entire room stank of his yeasty exhalations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain’s derisive expostulation drew the Adjunct’s attention. ‘I understand your impatience,’ Tavore said in a cool voice, ‘and no doubt you wish to leave. Unfortunately, I must speak to you and will do so shortly-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Once you’ve thoroughly detailed Brullyg’s emasculation, you mean.’ Shurq lifted one shapely leg and crossed it on the other, then laced together her hands on her lap, smiling sweetly up at the Adjunct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore’s colourless eyes regarded the pirate captain for a long moment, then she glanced over to where stood her retinue. ‘Banaschar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is wrong with this woman?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She’s dead,’ the ex-priest replied. ‘A necromantic curse.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you certain?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter cleared his throat and said, Adjunct, Corporal Deadsmell said the same thing when we saw her down in the tavern.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrullyg was staring at Shurq with wide, bulging eyes, his jaw hanging slack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Shurq’s side, Skorgen Kaban was suddenly frowning, his eyes darting. Then he withdrew the finger that had been plugging one ear and looked down at the gunk smeared all over it. After a moment, Pretty slid that finger into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well,’ Shurq sighed up at Tavore, ‘you’ve done it now, haven’t you? Alas, the coin of this secret is the basest of all, namely vanity. Now, if you possess some unpleasant bigotry regarding the undead, then I must re-evaluate my assessment of you, Adjunct. And your motley companions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Throatslitter’s surprise, Tavore actually smiled. ‘Captain, the Malazan Empire is well acquainted with undead, although few possessing your host of charms.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods below, she’s flirting with this sweet’Scented corpse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Host indeed,’ murmured Banaschar, then was so rude as to offer no elaboration. Hood-damned priests. Good for nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In any case,’ Tavore resumed, ‘we are without prejudice in this matter. I apologize for posing the question leading to this unveiling. I was simply curious.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So am I,’ Shurq replied. ‘This Malazan Empire of yours-do you have any particular reason for invading the Lether Empire?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was led to understand that this island is independent-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So it is, since the Edur Conquest. But you’re hardly invading one squalid little island. No. You’re just using this to stage your assault on the mainland. So let me ask again, why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Our enemy,’ the Adjunct said, all amusement now gone, ‘are the Tiste Edur, Captain. Not the Letherii. In fact, we would encourage a general uprising of Letherii-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You won’t get it,’ Shurq Elalle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not?’ Lostara Yil asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because we happen to like things the way they are. More or less.’ When no-one spoke, she smiled and continued, ‘The Edur may well have usurped the rulers in their absurd half-finished palace in Letheras. And they may well have savaged a few Letherii armies on the way to the capital. But you will not find bands of starving rebels in the forests dreaming of independence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not?’ Lostara demanded again in an identical tone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-228.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
