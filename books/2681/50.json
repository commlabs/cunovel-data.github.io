It seemed to him that he had done everything he could-but nothing had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if following Michel led nowhere? At some point, Dieter would have to cut his losses and interrogate the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how much time did he have? Tonight was the night of the full moon, but the English Channel was stormy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Allies might postpone the invasion-or they might decide to take their chances with the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few hours it might be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel had come to the station this morning in a van borrowed from Philippe Moulier, the meat supplier, and Dieter looked around for it, but could not see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guessed the van had been left here for Flick Clairet to pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now she might be anywhere within a radius of a hundred miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed himself for not setting someone to watch the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe diverted himself by considering how to interrogate Michel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s weak point was probably Gilberte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now she was in a cell at the chateau, wondering what was going to happen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would stay there until Dieter was quite sure he had finished with her; then she would be executed or sent to a camp in Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she be used to make Michel talk-and fast? The thought of the camps in Germany gave Dieter an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, he said to his driver, \"When the Gestapo send prisoners to Germany, they go by train, don\u0027t they?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Is it true that you put them in the kind of railway cars normally used for transporting livestock?\" \"Cattle trucks, yes, sir, it\u0027s good enough for those scum, communists and Jews and the like.\" \"Where do they board?\" \"Right here in Reims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train from Paris stops here.\" \"And how often do those trains run?\" \"There\u0027s one most days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt leaves Paris late in the afternoon and stops here around eight in the evening, if it\u0027s on time.\" Before he could progress his idea further, Dieter saw Michel emerge from the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen yards behind him in the crowd was Hans Hesse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey approached Dieter on the other side of the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter\u0027s driver started the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter turned in his seat to watch Michel and Hans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed Dieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, to Dieter\u0027s surprise, Michel turned into the alley alongside the cafee la Gare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans quickened his pace and turned the same corner less than a minute later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Michel trying to shake off his tail? Hans reemerged from the alley and looked up and down the street with a worried frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were not many people on the pavements, just a few travelers walking to and from the station and the last of the city center workers heading for home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans mouthed a curse and turned back into the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter groaned aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans had lost Michel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the worst foul-up Dieter had been involved in since the battle of Alam Haifa, when wrong intelligence had led Rommel to defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been the turning point of the North African war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter prayed this was not to be the turning point in Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stared despondently at the mouth of the alley, Michel emerged from the front entrance of the cafe Dieter\u0027s spirits leaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel had shaken off Hans but did not realize he had a second shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll was not yet lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel crossed the road, breaking into a run, and headed back the way he had come-toward Dieter in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter thought fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he tried to follow Michel, maintaining the surveillance, then he, too, would have to run, and that would make it obvious that he was tailing the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no good: the surveillance was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to seize Michel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel pounded along the pavement, shoving other pedestrians aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran awkwardly, because of his bullet wound, but he moved fast and rapidly approached Dieter\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter made a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Michel drew level, Dieter got out, narrowing the available pavement by holding the door wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel swerved to dodge around the obstacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter stuck out his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel tripped over his outstretched foot and went flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big man, he fell heavily on the paved sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter drew his pistol and thumbed the safety catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel lay prone for a second, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, groggily, he tried to get to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter touched the barrel of the gun to Michel\u0027s temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get up,\" he said in French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver got a pair of handcuffs from the trunk, secured Michel\u0027s wrists, and bundled him into the back of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans reappeared, looking dismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" \"He went in through the back door of the cafee la Gare and came out of the front,\" Dieter explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans was relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" \"Come with me to the station.\" Dieter turned to the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a gun?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Keep a close watch on this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he tries to escape, shoot him in the legs.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Dieter and Hans walked briskly into the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter buttonholed a uniformed railway man and said, \"I want to see the stationmaster right away.\" The man looked surly, but he said, \"I\u0027ll take you to his office.\" The stationmaster was dressed in a black jacket and waistcoat with striped trousers, an elegant old-fashioned uniform, worn thin at the elbows and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his bowler hat on even in his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was frightened by this visit from a high-powered German.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you?\" he said with a nervous smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you expecting a train from Paris with prisoners tonight?\" \"Yes, at eight o\u0027clock, as usual.\" \"When it comes, hold it here until you hear from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a special prisoner I want to board.\" \"Very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could have written authorization .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will arrange it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you do anything with the prisoners while the train is here?\" \"Sometimes we hose out the cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCattle trucks are used, you see, so there are no lavatory facilities, and frankly it becomes extremely unpleasant, without wishing to criticize-\" \"Do not clean the trucks tonight, you understand?\" \"Of course.\" \"Do you do anything else?\" The man hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\" He was guilty about something, Dieter could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, man, out with it, I\u0027m not going to punish you.\" \"Sometimes the railway men take pity on the prisoners, and give them water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not allowed, strictly speaking, but-\" \"No water will be given tonight.\" \"Understood.\" Dieter turned to Hans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to take Michel Clairet to the police station and lock him in a cell, then return here to the station and make sure my orders are carried out.\" \"Of course, Major.\" Dieter picked up the phone on the stationmaster\u0027s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me the chateau of Sainte-Cecile.\" When he got through he asked for Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a woman in the cells called Gilberte.\" \"I know,\" said Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty girl.\" Dieter wondered why Weber sounded so pleased with himself \"Would you please send her in a car to the railway station in Reims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Hesse is here, he will take charge of her.\" \"Very well,\" said Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold the line a moment, will you?\" He moved the phone away from his mouth and spoke to someone in the room, giving orders for Gilberte to be moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter waited impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeber came back on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve arranged that.\" \"Thank you-\" \"Don\u0027t hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have some news for you.\" This would be why he was sounding pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Dieter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have captured an Allied agent myself\" \"What?\" Dieter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a lucky break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" \"A few minutes ago.\" \"Where, for God\u0027s sake?\" \"Right here in Sainte-Cecile.\" \"How did that happen?\" \"She attacked a Militian, and three of my bright young people happened to witness it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had the presence of mind to capture the culprit, who was armed with a Colt automatic.\" \"Did you say \u0027she\u0027? The agent is a woman?\" \"Yes.\" That settled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackdaws were in Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chateau was their target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter said, \"Weber, listen to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she is part of a team of saboteurs intending to attack the chateau.\" \"They tried that before,\" Weber said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We gave them a hiding.\" Dieter controlled his impatience with an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed you did, so they may be more sly this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I suggest a security alert? Double the guards, search the chateau, and question all non-German personnel in the building.\" \"I have given orders to that effect.\" Dieter was not sure he believed that Weber had already thought of a security alert, but it did not matter, so long as he did so now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter briefly considered rescinding his instructions about Gilberte and Michel but decided not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might well need to interrogate Michel before the night was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will return to Sainte-Cecile immediately,\" he told Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish,\" Weber said casually, implying he could manage perfectly well without Dieter\u0027s assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to interrogate the new prisoner.\" \"I have already begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Becker is softening her up.\" \"For God\u0027s sake! I want her sane and able to speak.\" \"Of course.\" \"Please, Weber, this is too important for mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beg you to keep Becker under control until I get there.\" \"Very well, Franck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will make sure he doesn\u0027t overdo it.\" \"Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be there as fast as I can.\" Dieter hung up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-50.html","bookId":2681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM"}
