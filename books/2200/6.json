As I was reaching out for my towel with my eyes shut, I felt it being thrust into my hand. With a gasp, I opened my eyes to see Claude standing there in his altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phone\u0027s for you,\" he said, handing me the portable phone from the kitchen. He left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put it to my ear automatically. \"Hello?\" I said weakly. I didn\u0027t know what to think about first: me seeing Claude naked, Claude seeing me naked, or the whole fact that we were related and naked in the same room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie? You sound funny,\" said a faintly familiar male voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I just got a surprise,\" I said. \"I\u0027m so sorry... . Who is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, and it was a warm and friendly sound. \"This is Remy Savoy, Hunter\u0027s dad,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy had been married to my cousin Hadley, who was now dead. Their son, Hunter, and I had a connection, a connection that we needed to explore. I\u0027d been meaning to call Remy to set up a playdate for me and Hunter, and I chided myself now for putting it off. \"I hope you\u0027re calling to tell me that I can see Hunter this weekend?\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got to work Sunday afternoon, but I have Saturday off. Tomorrow, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great! I was going to ask if I could bring him over this evening, and maybe he could spend the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a lot of time to spend with a kid I didn\u0027t know; more important, a kid who didn\u0027t know me. \"Remy, do you have special plans or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. My dad\u0027s sister died yesterday, and they\u0027ve set the funeral for tomorrow morning at ten. But the visitation is tonight. I hate to take Hunter to the visitation and the funeral ... especially considering, you know, his ... problem. It might be pretty hard on him. You know how it is... . I can\u0027t ever be sure what he\u0027ll say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" And I did. A preschool telepath is tough to be around. My parents would have appreciated Remy\u0027s predicament. \"How old is Hunter now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five, just had a birthday. I was worried about the party, but we got through that okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. I\u0027d told him I\u0027d help out with Hunter\u0027s problem. \"Okay, I can keep him overnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I mean, really thanks. I\u0027ll bring him over when I get off work today. That okay? We\u0027ll be there about five thirty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would get off work between five and six, depending on my replacement being on time and how full my tables were. I gave Remy my cell number. \"If I\u0027m not home, call my cell. I\u0027ll be back here as soon as I can. What does he like to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked about Hunter\u0027s routine for a few minutes, and then I hung up. By then, I was dry, but my hair was hanging in damp rattails. After a few minutes with the blow-dryer, I set off to talk to Claude once I was securely dressed in my work clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claude!\" I yelled from the bottom of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" He sounded totally unconcerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come down here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appeared at the head of the stairs, his hairbrush in his hand. \"Yes, Cousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claude, the answering machine would have picked up the phone call. Please don\u0027t come in my room without knocking, and especially don\u0027t come in my bathroom without knocking!\" I would definitely employ the door lock from now on. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever used it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a prude?\" He seemed genuinely curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" But after a second, I said, \"But maybe compared to you, yes! I like my privacy. I get to decide who sees me naked. Do you get my point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Objectively speaking, you have beautiful points.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought the top of my head would pop off. \"I didn\u0027t expect this when I told you that you could stay with me. You like men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, I definitely prefer men. But I can appreciate beauty. I have visited the other side of the fence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I probably wouldn\u0027t have let you stay here if I\u0027d known that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaude shrugged, as if to say, \"Wasn\u0027t I smart to keep it from you, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" I said, and then stopped, because I was rattled. No matter what the circumstances, seeing Claude naked ... Well, your first reaction wouldn\u0027t be rage, either. \"I\u0027m going to tell you a few things, and I want you to take me seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, brush in hand, looking only politely attentive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Number one. I have a boyfriend, and he\u0027s a vampire, and I\u0027m not interested in cheating on him, and that includes seeing other guys naked ... in my bathroom,\" I tacked on hastily, thinking of twoeys of all sorts. \"If you can\u0027t respect that, you need to leave, and you\u0027ll just have to cry all the way home. Number two. I\u0027m having company tonight, a little kid I\u0027m babysitting, and you better act appropriate around him. You picking up what I\u0027m laying down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No nudity, be nice to the human kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the child yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he were mine, I\u0027d be raising him, you can bet your money. He\u0027s Hadley\u0027s. She was my cousin, the daughter of my aunt Linda. She was the, ah, the girlfriend of Sophie-Anne. You know, the former queen? And she became a vampire, eventually. This little boy, Hunter, is the son Hadley had before all that happened to her. His dad\u0027s bringing him by.\" Was Claude related to Hadley? Yes, of course, and therefore to Hunter. I pointed that out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like children,\" Claude told me. \"I\u0027ll behave. And I\u0027m sorry to have upset you.\" He gave a stab at sounding contrite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny, you don\u0027t look sorry. At all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m crying inside,\" he said, smiling a wicked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for goodness\u0027 sake,\" I said, turning away to complete my bathroom routine alone and unobserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d calmed down by the time I got to work. After all, I thought, Claude has probably seen a gazillion people naked in his time. Most supes didn\u0027t think nudity was any big deal. The fact that Claude and I were distantly related - my great-grandfather was his grandfather - wouldn\u0027t make any difference to him; in fact, it wouldn\u0027t make any difference to most of the supes. So, I told myself stoutly, no big deal. When I hit a slow time at work, I called Eric\u0027s cell and left a message to tell him I was expecting to babysit a child that night. \"If you can come over, great, but I wanted you to know ahead of time that someone else will be here,\" I told the voice mail. Hunter would make a pretty effective chaperone. Then I thought about my new upstairs roomer. \"Plus, I kind of forgot to tell you something the other night, and probably you aren\u0027t going to like it much. Also, I miss you.\" There was a beep. My message time was up. Well ... good. There was no telling what I would\u0027ve said next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tracker, Heidi, was supposed to arrive in Bon Temps tonight. It seemed like a year since Eric had decided to send her over to check my land. I felt a little concerned when I thought of her arrival. Would Remy think Hunter attending the funeral was so bad, if he knew who else was dropping by my house? Was I being irresponsible? Was I putting the child at risk?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was paranoid to think so. Heidi was coming to scout around in my woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had thrown off my niggling worry by the time I was preparing to leave Merlotte\u0027s. Kennedy had arrived to work for Sam again because he\u0027d made plans to take the Were girl, Jannalynn, to the casinos in Shreveport and out to dinner. I hoped she was real good to Sam, because he deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy was contorting herself in front of the mirror behind the bar, trying to discern a weight loss. I looked down at my own thighs. Jannalynn was really, really slim. In fact, I\u0027d call her skinny. God had been generous with me in the bosom department, but Jannalynn was the possessor of little apricotlike boobs she showed off by wearing bustiers and tank tops with no bra. She gave herself some attitude (and altitude) by wearing fantastic footwear. I was wearing Keds. I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a nice night!\" Kennedy told me brightly, and I straightened my shoulders, smiled, and wiggled my fingers good-bye. Most people thought Kennedy\u0027s big smile and good manners had to be put on. But I knew Kennedy was sincere. She\u0027d been trained by her pageant-queen mom to keep a smile on her face and a good word on her lips. I had to hand it to her; Danny Prideaux didn\u0027t faze Kennedy at all, and I felt like he\u0027d make most girls pretty nervous. Danny, who\u0027d been brought up to expect the world to beat him down so he better throw the first punch, lifted a finger to me to second Kennedy\u0027s farewell. He had a Coke in front of him, because Danny didn\u0027t drink on duty. He seemed content to play Mario Kart on his Nintendo DS, or to simply sit at the bar and watch Kennedy work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, lots of men would be nervous about working with Kennedy since she\u0027d served time for manslaughter. Some women would be, too. But I had no problem with her. I was glad Sam had stepped up for her. It\u0027s not that I approve of murder - but some people just beg to be killed, don\u0027t they? After all I\u0027d been through, I was forced to simply admit to myself that I felt that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got home about five minutes before Remy arrived with Hunter. I\u0027d had just enough time to pull off my work clothes, toss them in the hamper, and put on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt before Remy knocked at the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked through the peephole before I opened the door, on the theory that it\u0027s better to be safe than sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Remy!\" I said. He was in his early thirties, a quietly good-looking man with thick light brown hair. He was wearing clothes suitable for an evening visitation at a funeral home: khakis, a white-and-brown-striped broadcloth shirt, polished loafers. He\u0027d looked more comfortable in the flannel and jeans he\u0027d been wearing the first time I\u0027d met him. I looked down at his son. Hunter had grown since I\u0027d seen him last. He had dark hair and eyes like his mother, Hadley, but it was too early to say who he\u0027d favor when he grew up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squatted down and said, Hi, Hunter. I didn\u0027t say anything out loud, but I smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d almost forgotten. His face lit up. Aunt Sookie! he said. Pleasure ran through his head, pleasure and excitement. \"I have a new truck,\" he said out loud, and I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna show it to me? Come on in, you two, and let\u0027s get you settled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Sookie,\" Remy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I look like my mama, Dad?\" Hunter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Remy was startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Aunt Sookie says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy was used to little shocks like this by now, and he knew it would only get worse. \"Yes, you look like your mom, and she was good-looking,\" Remy told him. \"You\u0027re a lucky young man, Son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to look like a girl,\" Hunter said doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t. \"Not a bit,\" I said. \"Hunter, your room is right here.\" I indicated the open doorway. \"I used to sleep in this room when I was a kid,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter looked around, alert and cautious. But the low twin bed with its white bedspread and the old furniture and the worn rug by the bed were all homey and unthreatening. \"Where will you be?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here, across the hall,\" I told him, opening the door to my room. \"You just call out, and I\u0027ll come a-running. Or you can come climb in the bed with me, if you get scared in the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy stood, watching his son absorb all this. I didn\u0027t know how often the little boy had spent the night away from his dad; not too often, from the thoughts I was picking up from the boy\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bathroom\u0027s the next door down from your room, see?\" I pointed in. He looked into the old-fashioned room with his mouth hanging open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it looks different from your bathroom at home,\" I said, answering his thoughts. \"This is an old house, Hunter.\" The claw-foot tub and the black-and-white tiles were not what you saw in the rental houses and apartments Remy and Hunter had lived in since Katrina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s upstairs?\" Hunter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, a cousin of mine is staying up there. He\u0027s not home right now, and he comes in so late you may not even see him. His name is Claude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I go up there and look around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe tomorrow we\u0027ll go up together. I\u0027ll show you the rooms you can go into and the rooms that Claude is using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up to see that Remy was looking from Hunter to me, and he didn\u0027t know whether to be relieved or worried that I could talk to his son in a way he could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remy, it\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"I grew up, and it got easier. I know this is going to be tough, but at least Hunter is a bright boy with a sound body. His little problem is just ... less straightforward than most other kids\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good way to look at it.\" But Remy\u0027s worry didn\u0027t diminish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a drink?\" I said, not sure what to do with Remy now. Hunter had asked me silently if he could unpack his bag, and I\u0027d told him - the same way - that unpacking was fine with me. He\u0027d already unloaded a little backpack full of toys onto the bedroom floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you. I got to get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unpleasant to realize that I spooked Remy in the same way his son spooked other people. Remy might need my help, and I could tell he thought I was a pretty woman, but I could also see that I gave him the creeps. \"Is the visitation in Red Ditch?\" I asked. That was the town where Remy and Hunter lived. It was about an hour and a quarter\u0027s drive southeast from Bon Temps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, in Homer. So this is kind of on the way. If you run into any problems, just call my cell and I can come pick him up on the way home. Otherwise, I\u0027ll stay the night in Homer, go to the funeral at ten tomorrow, stay for the lunch at my cousin\u0027s home afterward, and pick Hunter up later in the afternoon, if that suits you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be fine,\" I said, which was sheer bravado on my part. I hadn\u0027t taken care of kids since I\u0027d sat with my friend Arlene\u0027s young \u0027uns, way back when. I didn\u0027t want to think about that; friendships that end bitterly are always sad. Those kids probably hated me now. \"I\u0027ve got videos we can watch, and a puzzle or two, and even some coloring books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Hunter asked, looking around like he expected to see a Toys \"R\" Us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say good-bye to your daddy, and we\u0027ll go looking for them,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Dad,\" Hunter said, waving a casual hand at Remy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy looked nonplussed. \"Want to give me a hug, champ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter held up his arms, and Remy picked him up and swung him around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter giggled. Remy smiled over the child\u0027s shoulder. \"That\u0027s my boy,\" he said. \"Be good for your aunt Sookie. Don\u0027t forget your manners. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" He put Hunter down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Hunter said, quite matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy had been expecting a big fuss, since he\u0027d never been away from the boy for so long. He glanced at me, then shook his head with a smile. He was laughing at himself, which I thought was a good reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how long Hunter\u0027s calm acceptance would last. Hunter looked up at me. \"I\u0027ll be okay,\" he said, and I realized he was reading my mind and interpreting my thought in his own way. Though I\u0027d had this experience before, it had been filtered through an adult\u0027s sensibility, and we\u0027d had the fun of experimenting with combining our telepathy to see what happened. Hunter wasn\u0027t filtering and rearranging my thoughts as someone older would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hugging his son again, Remy left reluctantly. Hunter and I found the coloring books. It turned out that Hunter liked to color more than anything else in the world. I settled him at the table in the kitchen and turned my attention to supper preparation. I could have cooked a meal from scratch, but I figured something that required little attention would be best the first time he stayed with me. You like Hamburger Helper? I asked silently. He looked up, and I showed him the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like that, Hunter said, recognizing the picture. He seemed to turn all his attention back to the turtle and butterfly scene he was coloring. The turtle was green and brown, approved turtle colors, but Hunter had gone to town on the butterfly. It was magenta, yellow, blue, and emerald green ... and he hadn\u0027t finished it yet. I noted that staying in the lines was not Hunter\u0027s main goal. Which was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen used to make Hamburger Helper, he told me. Kristen had been Remy\u0027s girlfriend. Remy had told me he and Kristen had broken up over her inability to accept Hunter\u0027s special gift. Not so surprisingly, Kristen had come to believe Hunter was creepy. Adults had thought I was a weird kid, too. Though I understood that now, at the time it had been painful. She was scared of me, Hunter said, and he looked up for a second. I could understand that look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just didn\u0027t understand, I said. There aren\u0027t many people like us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I the only other one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I know one other, a guy. He\u0027s a grown-up. He lives in Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what Hunter meant by \"okay\" until I looked at his thoughts a little longer. The little boy was thinking of his dad and some other men he admired - men who had jobs and wives or girl-friends, men who worked. Regular men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I answered. He found a way to make a living with it. He works for vampires. You can\u0027t hear vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never met one. Really?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang. \"I\u0027ll be back in a minute,\" I told Hunter, and I walked swiftly to the front door. I used the peephole. My caller was a young vampire female - presumably Heidi, the tracker. My cell phone rang. I fished it out of my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heidi should be there,\" Pam said. \"Has she come to the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brown ponytail, blue eyes, tall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You can let her in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was all very timely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the door open in a second. \"Hi. Come in,\" I said. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse.\" I stood aside. I didn\u0027t offer to shake hands; vampires don\u0027t do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi nodded to me and stepped into the house, darting quick looks around her, as if openly examining her surroundings were rude. Hunter came running into the living room, skidding to a stop as he saw Heidi. She was tall and bony, and possibly a mute. However, now Hunter could test my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heidi, this is my friend Hunter,\" I said, and waited for Hunter\u0027s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was fascinated. He was trying to read her thoughts, as hard as he could. He was delighted with the result, with her silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi squatted. \"Hunter, you\u0027re a fine boy,\" she said, to my relief. Her voice had an accent I associated with Minnesota. \"Are you going to be staying with Sookie for long?\" Her smile revealed teeth that were a little longer and sharper than the general run of humans\u0027, and I thought Hunter might be scared. But he eyed her with genuine fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you come to eat supper with us? he asked Heidi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut loud, please, Hunter, I said. She\u0027s different from humans, but she\u0027s not like us, either. Remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me as if he were afraid that I was angry. I smiled at him and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna eat supper with us, Miss Heidi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you, Hunter. I\u0027m here to go back in the woods and look for something we\u0027re missing. I won\u0027t disturb you any longer. My boss asked me to introduce myself to you, and then go about my work.\" Heidi stood, smiling down at the little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I saw a pitfall right in front of me. I was an idiot. But how could I help the boy if I didn\u0027t educate him? Don\u0027t let her know you can hear things, Hunter, I told the child. He looked up at me, his eyes amazingly like my cousin Hadley\u0027s. He looked a little scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi was glancing from Hunter to me, obviously feeling that something was going on that she couldn\u0027t discern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heidi, I hope you find something back there,\" I said briskly. \"Let me know before you leave, please.\" Not only did I want to know if she found anything, but I wanted to know when she was off the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This should take no more than two hours,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t tell you, \u0027Welcome to Louisiana,\u0027 \" I told her. \"I hope you didn\u0027t mind too much, moving here from Las Vegas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I go back to color?\" Hunter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, honey,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be there in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta go potty,\" Hunter called, and I heard the bathroom door close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi said, \"My son was his age when I was turned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer statement was so abrupt, her voice so flat, that it took me a moment to absorb what she\u0027d told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said, and I meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It was twenty years ago. He\u0027s grown now. He\u0027s a drug addict in Reno.\" Her voice still sounded flat and emotionless, as if she were talking about the son of a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery cautiously, I said, \"Do you go see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"I go to see him. At least I did before my former - employer - sent me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say, but she was still standing there, so I ventured another question. \"Do you let him see you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sometimes. I called an ambulance one time when I saw he\u0027d overdosed. Another night, I saved him from a vamp-blood addict who was going to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA herd of thoughts thundered through my head, and they were all unpleasant. Did he know the vampire watching him was his mother? What if he OD\u0027d in the daytime, when she was dead to the world? How would she feel if she wasn\u0027t there the night his luck finally ran out? She couldn\u0027t always be on hand. Could it be he\u0027d become an addict because his mother kept popping up when she should be dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the old days,\" I said, because I had to say something, \"vampires\u0027 makers left the area with the new vamps as soon as they were turned, to keep them away from their kin, who\u0027d recognize them.\" Eric and Bill and Pam had all told me that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left Las Vegas for over a decade, but I returned,\" Heidi said. \"My maker needed me there. Being part of the world isn\u0027t as great for all of us as it is for our leaders. I think Victor sent me to work for Eric in Louisiana to get me away from my son. I wasn\u0027t any use to them, they said, as long as Charlie\u0027s troubles were distracting me. But then again, my skill in tracking was only discovered when I was finding the man who sold bad drugs to Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled a little, and I knew what kind of end that man had met. Heidi was spooky in the extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, I\u0027ll be going to the back of your property to see what I can find. I\u0027ll let you know when I\u0027m through.\" Once she\u0027d walked out the front door, she vanished into the woods so swiftly that by the time I went to the back of the house to look out, she\u0027d melted into the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve had a lot of strange conversations, and I\u0027ve had some heart-wrenching conversations - but my talk with Heidi had been both. Fortunately, I had a couple of minutes to recover while I served our plates and monitored Hunter\u0027s hand washing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad to discover that the boy expected to say a prayer before he ate, and we bowed our heads together. He enjoyed his Hamburger Helper and green beans and strawberries. While we ate, Hunter told me all about his father, by way of table conversation. I was sure Remy would be horrified if he could hear the tell-all approach Hunter took. It was all I could do not to laugh. I guess the discussion would have seemed strange to anyone else, because half of it was mind-to-mind and half of it was spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any reminder from me, Hunter took his plate from the table to the sink. I held my breath until he slid it onto the counter carefully. \"Do you have a dog?\" he asked, looking around as if one might materialize. \"We always give our scraps to the dog.\" I remembered the little black dog I\u0027d seen running around the backyard of Remy\u0027s little house in Red Ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I don\u0027t, I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve got a friend that turns into a dog? he said, his eyes big with astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do,\" I said. \"He\u0027s a good friend.\" I hadn\u0027t counted on Hunter picking that up. This was very tricky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad says I\u0027m smart,\" Hunter said, looking rather doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you are,\" I told him. \"I know it\u0027s hard being different, because I\u0027m different, too. But I grew up to be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou sound kind of worried, though, Hunter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed with Remy. Hunter was a smart little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am. It was hard for me, growing up, because no one understood why I was different. People won\u0027t believe you. I sat down in a chair by the table and pulled Hunter onto my lap. I was worried this was too much touching for him, but he seemed glad to sit there. People don\u0027t want to know that someone can hear what they\u0027re thinking. They don\u0027t have any privacy when people like us are around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter didn\u0027t exactly get \"privacy,\" so we talked about the concept for a while. Maybe that was over the head of most five-year-olds - but Hunter wasn\u0027t the average kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo is the thing out in the woods giving you privacy? Hunter asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? I knew I\u0027d reacted with too much anxiety and dismay when Hunter looked upset, too. Don\u0027t worry about it, honey, I said. No, he\u0027s no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter looked reassured enough for me to feel that it was time to change the subject. His attention was wandering, so I let him scramble down. He began playing with the Duplos he\u0027d brought in his backpack, transporting them from the bedroom to the kitchen with his dump truck. I thought of getting him some Legos for a belated birthday present, but I\u0027d check with Remy first, get his okay. I listened in to Hunter while I was doing the dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found out that he was as interested in his anatomy as most five-year-olds are, and that he thought it was funny that he got to stand up when he peed and I had to sit down, and that he hadn\u0027t liked Kristen because she didn\u0027t really like him. She pretended to, he told me, exactly as if he\u0027d known when I was listening in to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been standing at the sink with my back to Hunter, but it didn\u0027t make any difference in our conversation, which was another strange feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you tell when I\u0027m listening to your head? I asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it tickles, Hunter told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that because he was so young? Would it have \"tickled\" in my head, too, if I\u0027d met another telepath when I was that age? Or was Hunter unique among telepaths?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that lady who came to the door dead?\" Hunter said. He\u0027d jumped up and run around the table to stand by my side while I dried the skillet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"She\u0027s a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will she bite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t bite you or me,\" I said. \"I guess sometimes she bites people if they tell her that\u0027s okay.\" Boy, I was worried about this conversation. It was like talking about religion with a child without knowing the parents\u0027 preferences. \"I think you said you\u0027d never met a vampire before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am,\" he said. I started to tell Hunter he didn\u0027t have to call me \"ma\u0027am,\" but then I stopped. The better manners he had, the easier this world would be for him. \"I never met anything like that man in the woods, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he had my undivided attention, and I tried hard not to let him read my alarm. Just as I was about to ask him careful questions, I heard the screen door to the back porch open, and then foot-steps across the boards. A light knock at the back door told me that Heidi had returned from scouting in the woods, but I looked out the little window in the door to be sure. Yep, it was the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m through,\" she said, when I opened the door. \"I\u0027ll be on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed Hunter didn\u0027t run to the door as he had last time. He was behind me, though; I could feel his brain buzzing. He was not exactly scared, but anxious, as most children are about the unknown. But he was definitely pleased that he couldn\u0027t hear her. I\u0027d been pleased when I found out vampire brains were silent to me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heidi, did you learn anything?\" I said hesitantly. Some of this might not be appropriate for Hunter to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fae tracks in your woods are fresh and heavy. There are two scents. They crisscross.\" She inhaled, with apparent delight. \"I love the smell of fae in the night. Better than gardenias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0027d already assumed she\u0027d detect the fae Basim had reported smelling, this wasn\u0027t a big revelation. But Heidi said there were definitely two fae. That was bad news. It confirmed what Hunter had said, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did you find?\" I stepped back a little, so she could see Hunter was behind me and tailor her remarks accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither of them is the fairy I smell here in your house.\" Not good news. \"Of course, I smelled many werewolves. I also smell a vampire - I think Bill Compton, though I\u0027ve only met him once. There\u0027s an old c-o-r-p-s-e. And a brand-new c-o-r-p-s-e buried due east from your house, in a clearing by the stream. The clearing is in a stand of wild plums.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this was reassuring. The old c-o-r-p-s-e, well, I\u0027d expected that, and I knew who it was. (I spared a moment to wish Eric hadn\u0027t buried Debbie on my property.) And if Bill was the vampire walking through the woods, that was all right ... though it did make me worry that he was just roaming around brooding all night instead of trying to build a new life for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new corpse was a real problem. Basim hadn\u0027t said anything about that. Had someone buried a body on my property in the last two nights, or had Basim simply left it off his list for some reason? I was staring at Heidi while I thought, and she finally raised her eyebrows. \"Okay, thanks,\" I said. \"I appreciate your taking the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of the little one,\" she said, and then she was across the back porch and out the door. I didn\u0027t hear her walk around the house to her car, but I didn\u0027t expect to. Vampires can be mighty quiet. I did hear her engine start up, and she drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I knew my thoughts might worry Hunter, I forced myself to think of other things, which was harder than it sounds. I wouldn\u0027t have to do it long; I could tell my little visitor was getting tired. He put up the expected fuss about going to bed, but he didn\u0027t protest as much when I told him he could take a long bath first in the fascinating claw-foot tub. While Hunter splashed and played and made noises, I stayed in the bathroom, looking through a magazine. I made sure he actually cleaned himself in between sinking boats and racing ducks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided we\u0027d skip washing his hair. I figured that would be an ordeal, and Remy hadn\u0027t given me any instructions one way or another on hair washing. I pulled the plug. Hunter really enjoyed the gurgle of the water as it went down the drain. He rescued the ducks before they could drown, which made him a hero. \"I am the king of the ducks, Aunt Sookie,\" he crowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They need a king,\" I said. I knew how stupid ducks were. Gran had kept some for a while. I supervised Hunter\u0027s towel usage and helped him get his pajamas on. I reminded him to use the toilet again, and then he brushed his teeth, not very thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-five minutes later, after a story or two, Hunter was in bed. At his request, I left the light in the hall on, and his door was ajar an inch or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found I was exhausted and in no mood to puzzle over Heidi\u0027s revelation. I wasn\u0027t used to tending to a child, though Hunter had been easy to care for, especially for a little guy who was staying with a woman he didn\u0027t know well. I hoped he\u0027d enjoyed talking to me brain-to-brain. I also hoped Heidi hadn\u0027t spooked him too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t let myself focus on her macabre little biography, but now that Hunter was asleep, I found myself thinking about her story. It was an awful pity that she\u0027d had to return to Nevada during her son\u0027s lifetime. In fact, she now probably looked the same age as her son, Charlie. What had happened to the boy\u0027s father? Why had her maker required her return? When she\u0027d first been turned, vampires hadn\u0027t yet shown themselves to America and the rest of the world. Secrecy had been paramount. I had to agree with Heidi. Coming out of the coffin hadn\u0027t solved all the vamps\u0027 problems, and it had created quite a few new ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would almost rather not have known about the sadness Heidi carried around with her. Naturally, since I was my grandmother\u0027s product, such a wish made me feel guilty. Shouldn\u0027t we always be ready to listen to the sad stories of others? If they want to tell them, aren\u0027t we obliged to listen? Now I felt I had a relationship with Heidi, based on her misery. Is that a real relationship? Was there something sympathetic about me that she liked, something that called this story forth? Or did she routinely tell new acquaintances about her son, Charlie? I could hardly believe that. I figured Hunter\u0027s presence had triggered her confidences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew (though I didn\u0027t want to admit it to myself) that if Heidi remained so distracted by the issue of her junkie son, one night he\u0027d get a visit from someone ruthless. After that, she\u0027d be able to focus her whole attention on the wishes of her employer. I shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I didn\u0027t think Victor would hesitate a second to do such a thing, I wondered, Would - or could\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- Eric?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could even ask myself that, I knew the answer was yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, Charlie made a great hostage to ensure Heidi\u0027s good behavior. As in: \"If you don\u0027t spy on Eric, we\u0027ll pay Charlie a visit.\" But if that ever changed ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this Heidi meditation was by way of dodging the more immediate issue. Who was the fresh corpse in my woods, and who had planted it there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Hunter hadn\u0027t been there, I would\u0027ve picked up the phone to call Eric. I would\u0027ve asked him to bring a shovel and come to help me dig a body up. That was what a boyfriend should do, right? But I couldn\u0027t leave Hunter alone in the house, and I would\u0027ve felt terrible if I\u0027d asked Eric to go out in the woods by himself, even though I knew he wouldn\u0027t think anything about it. In fact, probably he\u0027d have sent Pam. I sighed. I couldn\u0027t seem to get rid of one problem without acquiring another. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-in-the-family-sookie-stackhouse-10/page-6.html","bookId":2200,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:35 PM"}
