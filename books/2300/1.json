For one thing, she never saw her mom and dad during the day, and they never ate dinner together, the way families did on TV. As far back as Cara could remember, she had eaten all her meals in the company of her nanny, Charlotte Ray, until Charlotte retired. Cara\u0027s new nanny, Melissa Kent, had been much younger than Miss Ray, and although Cara missed her old nanny, Miss Kent quickly found a place in Cara\u0027s affections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara was homeschooled by Miss Louise Byrne until she turned twelve. On her birthday, Cara\u0027s father informed her that she would be going to public school so that she might associate with other children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara wasn\u0027t happy about that, but her father assured her that it was for her own good. She needed to learn how to get along with people her own age. To that end, Miss Byrne was dismissed and Frank Di Giorgio was hired. Mr. Di Giorgio had thick black hair going gray at the temples and gray eyes that, when he was angry, looked as cold as stone. He was built like a wrestler and had a face like a bulldog. It was his job to drive Cara to school and pick her up afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing to public school had been a trial. After spending the first twelve years of her life with adults, Cara had found it hard to relate to children her own age. It had also emphasized, once again, the differences between her parents and the parents of the other kids. Her mother and father didn\u0027t attend parent-teacher conferences or school plays or any other functions, unless they were held at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Cara went to school, she had assumed that everybody opened their Christmas presents at night and hunted for Easter eggs after the sun went down. Thanksgiving was a holiday that was never celebrated in her home. Valentine\u0027s Day meant a big candy heart from her daddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara\u0027s favorite holiday was Halloween. She always dressed up as a witch, and her mother and father always went trick-or-treating with her. Her mom dressed as a witch, too. Her dad didn\u0027t dress up, though he did wear a long black cloak that made the other kids ask if he was supposed to be a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cara turned sixteen, she was allowed to go out with boys, but only if they went out with a group or with another couple. To her chagrin, Mr. Di Giorgio was always nearby and Cara came to understand that he was no longer just her chauffeur, but her bodyguard as well, though she had no idea why she needed a bodyguard. Bodyguards were for presidents and rock stars, not for ordinary people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the question to her mom and dad the night after it occurred to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan DeLongpre considered his reply for several moments before he answered his daughter\u0027s question. He wasn\u0027t surprised by it, only amazed that it had taken her so long to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a wealthy man,\" he explained patiently, \"and I have many enemies. Frank is there to make sure that no harm comes to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of enemies?\" Cara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruthless ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe digested that a moment, then asked, \"Why don\u0027t I ever see you or Mom during the day? Why don\u0027t we eat together? Where do the two of you go every day, and why can\u0027t I ever go with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan looked at his wife, one brow arched in a silent plea for help. He and Brenna had both known this day would come sooner or later, but how did a man tell his adopted daughter that her father and mother were vampires and, more than that, that her mother was a witch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna took her daughter\u0027s hand in hers and gave it a squeeze. \"Years ago, while traveling in Africa, your father and I contracted a rare disease. The sun is like poison to us now, so we sleep during the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara nodded. She knew she was adopted. Her parents had told her that as soon as she was old enough to understand. It explained why she wasn\u0027t affected by the same disease that plagued her mom and dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we could eat dinner together?\" Cara suggested. \"Like other families. You know, like the ones on TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna and Roshan exchanged glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Due to our ailment, your father and I are on a rather strict liquid diet,\" Brenna said after a moment, \"but we\u0027ll be happy to sit at the table with you while you eat, if you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that very much,\" Cara said, smiling. \"At least once in awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do,\" her father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we very rich?\" Cara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" her father replied soberly. \"Very.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I could have a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re eighteen,\" her father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara sighed. \"Lily got a new car for her sixteenth birthday. So did Jennifer. Why can\u0027t I have a car now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna looked at her husband, one brow raised as she, too, waited for his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan glanced from his daughter to his wife and back again. \"We\u0027ll compromise,\" he said. \"You can have the car of your choice when you turn seventeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car she chose was a baby blue convertible with black interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara was twenty-two years old when she finally discovered why her parents weren\u0027t like everyone else\u0027s. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-1.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
