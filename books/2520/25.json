Our kiss had happened. Why not this, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to tell him all the details I hadn’t had the courage to tell him before. If I stayed quiet, he would stay out here. He was too stubborn for his own good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what happened in yours, but in mine, there were monsters all around us, wanting to eat us.” The words gushed out of me. “And the other night, I saw two of them, outside my window, for real and not in a vision. At the time, I thought I was crazy.” Now, I wasn’t so sure. “They were watching me and when I checked on them, there were tracks. The ones you showed me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sucked in a breath, an indication he’d heard me, but he never glanced in my direction. He kept his attention straight ahead, clearly waiting for the threat to materialize. If it did, would he see the monster or not? Would I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any idea what you just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twig snapped in the distance, and he went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour men trudged into a ray of moonlight, their clothing dirty and ripped. Their eyes sagged, their skin was pitted and their finger bones were gnarled and curled in. Hair had fallen out of their scalps in chunks, leaving them mostly bald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNausea hit me with such force I nearly doubled over. “Come with me, Cole. Please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go back to the club!” he shouted at me—and sprinted toward the monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to process the surreal fact that Cole did, indeed, see the monsters, that this wasn’t a hallucination, that my dad had always been right, that monsters had eaten him and my mom. That would come later, and I suspected I would scream and cry and rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, I had to fight, had to put the skills my dad had given me to use. I couldn’t allow Cole to face the monsters alone, whether I had a weapon or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe…in…out…as if I were part of a movie and someone controlled the stage, the world slowed around me. I watched as Cole ran and his—oh, sweet heaven. Cole multiplied. One Cole became two Coles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passage I’d read from that journal suddenly boomed inside my mind. We are spirit beings, those spirits our source of \u0026nbsp;power, and we have a soul…our logic and emotions, and we live in a \u0026nbsp;body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way. Surely not…but what other explanation was there? Cole’s spirit had just left his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were now two versions of him, and both wore the same clothes. Cole One—his body, most likely—appeared solid while some sort of mist shimmered around Cole Two. His spirit, I would bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost too much to take in. His body stood completely still while his spirit continued to surge ahead. I watched as he extended his crossbow and launched an arrow. Midair, the arrowhead grew sharp little arms and those arms sliced one of the creatures across the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no ensuing spray of blood, but there was definitely an open wound. The creature’s entire body shook, then he just sort of stopped, his head detaching from his body and both toppling to the ground. And yet, still the monster’s body moved. Still his eyes blinked and his teeth snapped in Cole’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in two pieces, he lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was that possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole launched another arrow, hit another creature, seconds later meeting the two left standing with his fists. He punched and ducked, spun, went low, reaching for another weapon stashed in his boot. A blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moan sounded from behind me. I whirled. Three more monsters had decided to join our Dance Party Massacre. Two males, one female. I knew their sexes only because the boys wore tuxes and the girl wore a lacy pink gown that belled at the waist. Though they weren’t my stalker bride and groom, they projected the same hungry menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy panic grew wings and flew throughout my entire body. These things had killed my parents. These things had killed my grandfather. I couldn’t let them attack Cole while he was busy with the others. He’d lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage simmered inside me and burned through the panic. These things killed my parents. They killed my grandfather. \u0026nbsp;They wanted to kill Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese things had to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother deep breath, and I, too, launched forward. I had a straight shot, parked cars lined up at both sides, creating a clear path for me. Black oozed from each pitted face watching me, and up close, I saw that their eyes were also black, glazed and shiny with feral yearning. And though one was hunched over and hobbling on what looked to be broken ankles and the other was actually missing a foot, they moved with surprising speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Cole, I threw punches the moment I reached them—but my fists went through their bodies. I felt only air. Well, air and a wave of revulsion that fizzed in my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creatures reached for me, too, and they, too, missed, but again that wave of revulsion turned my blood into corrosive acid. I stumbled backward, smacked into a car. The monsters kept me in their sights and closed in on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rage expounded in a starburst of energy, propelling me forward. I’d make contact this time. Nothing would stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know what? I was right. I punched and I made contact. The waves of revulsion were replaced by frigid cold. I’d never been this cold in my entire life. Tremor after tremor shook me as the creatures grabbed for me, trying to latch on to my arms, scratching me. I spun out of the way, my muscles stiff, as if I’d never before used them—and that’s when I saw myself leaning against a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was here, fighting. Wasn’t I? Or…was I like Cole? Was my spirit now, somehow, operating outside my body? But how could that be? Can’t process this, either…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe confusion cost me dearly. Fingers tangled in my hair and jerked me to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad’s advice played through my mind. If \u0026nbsp;you fall, go down swinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! I’d trained for this. I could do this. I arched my back, giving my arm more room to fly backward. My palm slammed into the creature’s nose, sending him propelling backward. I lost several strands of hair, but I was freed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened, twisted, and kicked out my leg, nailing another creature—the female—in the stomach and sending her propelling backward, too. She ghosted through a car, only to stand on the other side and shake off her disorientation. Her gaze locked on me, and I knew she planned to come back for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d have to wait her turn. The one I’d sent to the ground had turned over, was sitting up and reaching for me. My teeth chattered as I kicked his arm, then his jaw, and though he twisted with the momentum, he remained focused on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was I supposed to disable these things for good? And where was the third one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever lose sight of your enemy. You’ll \u0026nbsp;regret it. My dad had also told me that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with everything else, he’d been right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind, trunklike arms wrapped around my torso. I felt a humid puff of breath against my neck. Crap! I slammed my head back, hitting the creature with as much force as possible. His grip loosened, even as my brain protested the action with a sharp lance of pain. Spinning, I doubled tapped him in the jaw with so much power, I think I severed his spinal cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he fell, teeth flew out of his mouth like pieces of candy. But when he landed, he, too, seemed unaffected by the damage. He stood, his head remaining at an odd angle—but still he moved toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back of my mind, I knew something just as odd was happening beyond our little fight club circle, but I couldn’t yet reason out what it was. Something to consider later, I supposed. If I survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy three opponents converged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched one, then another, while kicking the third. All three extended their arms toward me, and I darted out of the way, still punching, still kicking. The more we fought, the harder my heart pounded, and the more excited they seemed to become. The more excited they grew, the faster they moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one of the males at last managed to shackle my wrist with his fingers, his grip was so strong I couldn’t bust free. He tugged me to the ground. I went down swinging, just as before, but he held on, flashing his teeth at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t let him bite me. Couldn’t die like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter how I twisted or how hard I bucked I still couldn’t free myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the female and the other monster dropped to their knees beside me. There were only three of them, but it seemed as though they possessed a thousand hands, holding me down, ripping at my clothing, their faces lowering…lowering…when they bit me, I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistering, sizzling pain struck, though it failed to melt the ice that encased me. I was a toxic mix of too hot and too cold, dying…wanting to die. Their teeth burrowed through my skin, their faces seeming to disappear inside me. It was as if they were actually gnawing on my bones without spilling a single drop of my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought and fought and fought to no avail. One of them finally stopped chewing, then the other, then the other. Though they maintained a steady grip on me, they peered down at me in horror, as if they’d tasted something disgusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly one of the males seized up, an arrow protruding from his neck. He swatted at it as he fell forward and landed beside me. Without him holding down my ankles, I was able to kick the female in the chin. She stumbled backward. The other monster released me of his own free will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole was behind the woman an instant later, reaching around and flattening his palm over her heart. A white light erupted between them, blinding in its intensity. It remained only for a moment, a single snap of fingers, but when it vanished, Cole’s arms were empty, the female gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raced to one of the males, then the other, producing the same blinding white light. A second later, he was hovering over me, and our gazes met. We were both panting, sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I…” Couldn’t speak. Hurt too badly. Could barely breathe. Darkness swallowed me whole, and I lost sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaim… The word whispered through my head, followed by another, just as bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urge to do both filled me. Maim…kill…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDestroy… \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-25.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
