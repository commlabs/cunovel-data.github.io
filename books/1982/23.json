There must’ve been a mistake. It was a joke. Jason Manning was a confirmed bachelor, wasn’t he? Despite her feelings for him, Charlotte had accepted that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t pretend you didn’t know,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I thought…I thought you wanted to stop seeing me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snickered as though he didn’t believe her and turned away. “Why would I take you to a fancy restaurant if I wanted to say something as ridiculous as that?” He turned back, glaring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To let me down easy. What did you expect me to think, when you were in such a bad mood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already told you I’m no good at this sort of thing. If you want romance and a bunch of pretty words, you’re going to have to marry someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on her feet and not quite sure how she got there. “You honestly want to marry me?” she repeated as her eyes brimmed with tears. They were tears of relief. Tears of joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit down,” he said gruffly. “If I’m going to do this, I want to do it right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte complied and was shocked when Jason got down on one knee directly in front of her. He cleared his throat. “I love you, Charlotte. I wasn’t planning to fall in love with you, but I knew it was happening, and I let it happen because—well, I don’t really know. It happened and I’m glad it did. I can’t think of spending a day without you at my side. I can’t imagine playing softball without you there. I love you. I love the chocolate chip cookies you bake. I admire you for the wonderful job you’ve done raising Carrie. I’m deeply impressed by your wisdom and courage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jase.” She blinked back her tears and brought her fingertips to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the first woman I ever dated who let me be myself. You didn’t feel obligated to clean up after me. You don’t act as if my refrigerator’s some kind of scary science experiment.” He grinned, apparently pleased with his own wit. “You even like sports.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lump in her throat made it impossible to speak. Tears ran unrestrained down her face. With all her heart she wanted to shout, “Yes, I’ll marry you,” and throw her arms around him. But she was afraid to believe Jason would continue to love her once he learned how inadequate she was, how worthless she was as a lover. She didn’t know if she could bear to disappoint him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it helps,” he said in a low voice, “I talked to Carrie, and she’s all for us getting married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte sniffed tearfully. “You mean my daughter’s given you her seal of approval?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another silence. Then he said, “I don’t mean to rush you, but I have this sore knee. I slid into first base last week and I’ve been in pain ever since. So, if you don’t mind, I’d prefer a quick answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could stop herself, before she could listen to her head instead of her heart, she nodded. It wasn’t a very enthusiastic nod, perhaps, but Jason didn’t seem to have any objections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank God,” he murmured, awkwardly rising to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You idiot. You didn’t have to get down on your knee,” she whispered through her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I did,” he said, but he sounded grateful to be off it as he sat down on the log beside her. A deep sigh rumbled through his chest. “It wasn’t the most romantic proposal, was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jase, it was perfect,” she said, touching the side of his face and gazing into his eyes. Her throat was tight and constricted. “What you said about not being able to live without me…that’s how I feel about you. Sharing cookies, going to ball games, walking the dog together—it all sounds wonderful. I guess I’m not much of a romantic, either,” she said with a shy laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t buy a diamond ring. I figured you’d want to pick a setting yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ring. Charlotte froze. Soon he’d want to discuss a wedding date. A chill worked its way through her, the same cold feeling she’d experienced whenever Tom wanted to make love. A sick sensation would build in the pit of her stomach and by the time they went to bed she’d feel encased in ice. All Tom had to do was kiss her and he’d know. Then the tirades would begin, the accusations, the ugliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason was going to kiss her, too. Now. His lips grazed hers. Briefly. Lightly. The cold fear melted as if it had never been. Charlotte groaned and slipped her arms around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again, but this time the kiss blossomed into something wild and erotic that left Charlotte panting, seeking more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drew apart, and she rested her forehead against his. When he spoke, his voice was husky and warm, as warm as heated brandy and just as intoxicating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to be very good in bed,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte tensed, panic a heartbeat away, but she forced it down, focusing instead on how gentle he’d always been with her. How patient. With Jason, she’d felt a level of pleasure she’d never realized she was capable of reaching. When he kissed her she felt hot and quivery from the inside out. Maybe it would be different this time, with this man. Maybe. She prayed that was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re worried about making love, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d never hurt you, Charlotte. I hope you understand that. Whatever the problem is, we’ll work it out together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m grateful…for that.” Despite the excitement she felt at his kisses, she had to fight back the fear that threatened to choke her every time he mentioned the physical aspects of their relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer only recourse was to insist on a long engagement. That way she could slowly, gradually, feel comfortable with their sexual relationship. After they made love…She hesitated. There’d been a time she wouldn’t have thought that was possible, but Jason had given her hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to set the wedding date?” she asked, deciding to broach the subject now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but…” He shrugged. “There’s one small problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to let my parents tell you. It’s only fair. They’re at home, waiting for us now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe this!” Jason muttered under his breath as they pulled into his parents’ driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are all these cars doing here?” Carrie asked from the backseat. Jason had insisted on going back to the apartment to pick her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll see,” he said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither his parents owned a car dealership or they were entertaining a houseful of company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is going to be a real circus.” He sighed as he helped Charlotte out of the front seat. Carrie bounded out from the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte’s nervousness, already heightened by the prospect of an audience, grew exponentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Elizabeth Manning stepped out of the house. Jason’s father and brothers, sisters-in-law and several children all crowded on the front porch behind her. The porch light revealed a variety of expressions, from amusement to elation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” his mother asked as she walked toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason slid his arm around Charlotte’s waist and slowly, sweetly smiled down at her. In those brief seconds, Charlotte was comforted and reassured by his love. Her senses sang and her heart fluttered wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason lowered his head. Charlotte wasn’t sure that kissing in front of his parents, his whole family, was the best thing to do. Oh, what the heck. She was marrying Jason. They were in love, so a simple kiss shouldn’t offend anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir lips met and she moaned a little with surprise and wonder at the ready response he never failed to evoke from her. Her hand crept up his chest and gripped the lapel of his suit jacket as his mouth made love to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he broke away, he was breathless. For that matter, so was Charlotte. She marveled that he was able to speak at all. “Does that answer your question, Mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Charlotte’s agreed to marry you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a heartbeat,” she answered for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t it great!” Carrie shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpontaneous applause broke out from the porch, followed by several earsplitting whistles. Ryan and Ronnie were pounding their feet but she doubted the little boys understood exactly what the family was celebrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening was lovely; honeysuckle and roses scented the air. The sun had almost set, casting—literally—a rosy glow over the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason bowed as though he were a knight and she his lady, accepting his family’s enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you realize you’re getting the runt of the litter,” Paul told her, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Rich put in. “Just be grateful that Charlotte’s willing to put Jason out of his misery. He’s been walking around like a lovesick puppy for weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason glowered at his brothers, but she could tell he wasn’t angry. He took their teasing in stride. From the time he’d brought her to that first softball game, Charlotte had envied him his family, especially the close relationship he shared with his brothers. The three were more than brothers; they were best friends. They looked out for one another and, just as important, they laughed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah and Jamie were best friends, too. Yet they seemed eager to extend that camaraderie to Charlotte. They’d gone out of their way to include her, to make her feel welcome, a part of the family. One of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s mother came forward, tears in her eyes as she hugged Charlotte. “I couldn’t be more pleased. Jason couldn’t have chosen better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Charlotte said, blushing. Doubt bobbed like a cork to the surface of her mind. Not that she didn’t love Jason. She did, with all her heart, but she still wasn’t sure whether she was the right woman for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so happy for you—and for us,” Jamie said, hugging her next. “The two of you are perfect for each other. Leah and I agreed on that the minute we saw you together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warmth permeated Charlotte’s heart. She wanted so badly to believe it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be sisters now,” Leah whispered, taking Charlotte’s hands and lightly squeezing her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t be marrying into a more wonderful family,” Charlotte said to Jason as they made their way into the house. Carrie followed, carrying Jeremy, while the other children raced excitedly ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brothers congratulated Jason, slapping him on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, Jason and Charlotte sat on the couch and the family gathered around them, making them the center of attention. Every eye was on Charlotte, smiling and happy, yet expectant. Puzzled, she glanced up at Jason, wondering if they wanted her to say something, to make some speech or pronouncement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does she know yet?” Paul asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-23.html","bookId":1982,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM"}
