And then there was the hair—his hair was the exact shade of brown and the precise thickness even though it was shorter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes were a carbon copy, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male didn’t look Rhage’s way, but instead, went to the reception desk, one hand lifting up to his temples as if he usually wore a hat and was reflexively trying to take it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast footsteps approached from behind Rhage, but he didn’t pay them any mind, at least not until V appeared with a gun out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck’s wrong?” the brother demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhage tried to answer. Well, he guessed he did. Something was coming out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” V demanded, looking all around and seeing nothing wrong. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that moment that the male, who was clearly a relative of Bitty’s, glanced up from the reception desk, as if he had heard Vishous’s voice. And the second V saw what he was doing, the brother cursed long and low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhage’s phone began to ring, but he didn’t even think of answering it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn slow motion, he took step after step toward the male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever the guy was, he had refocused on the receptionist and was speaking in a quiet voice with a commoner’s accent—but then he stopped and turned as Rhage halted in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhage said nothing as he stared into those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” the male said. “I don’t have an appointment. I wasn’t sure where to go. I can leave. I’ll just leave—I gave her my number. I’m not looking for any trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male lifted his fists up as if he were ready to defend himself, even against a brother—but it was clear he would prefer not to have to: His stare was level without being aggressive, his affect calm and watchful as his stance widened, and he settled his weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the classic preparation of someone used to fighting, who was also not an instigator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is your name?” Rhage asked, grimly aware that people were coming around them. V, Saxton … even Wrath himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t say it, Rhage prayed. Don’t say it, dontsayit—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruhn. My name is Ruhn. My sister died about two months ago. I’m here for my niece, Lizabitte.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary put her phone down again and lifted her hands to her face. As she stared at the computer screen, reading and rereading the short PM, she was screaming in her head even as she remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rhage …,” she moaned. “Oh, God …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack with the phone. Calling him again. Voice mail for the fourth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to be in with the King, but God! why now—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down,” she said aloud. “Breathe and relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be anything. Someone who was playing a practical joke—who just happened to have the name that Bitty had used. Somebody who had heard Mary was mated to a Brother and wanted to take advantage of that by posing as Bitty’s uncle—even though … well, she hadn’t identified herself as a foster parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it was a total mistake, a message for somebody else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, ’cuz that was likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, Rhage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were shaking so badly that she fumbled the cell phone, and had to bend over and fish around the dark foot-well of the desk to find the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downward repositioning was kind of handy, really, considering she was seriously thinking about throwing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRighting herself, she looked—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarissa was in the open doorway of her office and her boss seemed like she had seen a ghost. Great. Did the universe have a BOGO on potentially life-shattering events tonight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant she heard the grim tone of voice, Mary clamped her molars together and thought, Nope, not a two-for-one. This was about her. This was about the private message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr that Rhage had been hurt or killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary got to her feet. “Tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to get to the Audience House right now. A young male has shown up and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says he’s Bitty’s uncle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarissa came in. “Did Rhage call you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I … it doesn’t matter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary reached for her coat. Dropped it as she had the phone. Took two tries to pick the thing up. Then couldn’t get her arm through the sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zsadist is outside.” Marissa helped her with the sleeves and then pulled the lapels to order as if Mary were a child. “He’s going to drive you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Marissa handed Mary her purse. Her phone. Put her red scarf around her neck and tied it in a loose knot. “He’s going to take you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarissa stepped back so Mary could go out first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mary didn’t move. Somehow, the messages from her brain to her feet were getting lost in the pathways of her gray matter, the command to left-and-right it out of her office, to the stairs, and down to the front door scattering like autumn leaves in a cold north wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer family. Her precious little family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer and Rhage, now with Bitty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe … not with Bitty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just want to go back,” she heard herself whisper through sudden tears. “I want to run the night back, I want a reverse lever, a way to back up. I want to be at home during the day, watching movies and sleeping with them both.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-vow-black-dagger-legacy-2/page-50.html","bookId":1778,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM"}
