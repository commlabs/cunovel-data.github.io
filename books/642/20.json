The old grin was upon the other\u0027s face; and the boy realized with a sudden sinking of the heart how hard and savage he was. Finnegan was a babe in arms compared with Charlie Swift.\n\u003cbr\u003e To convert him would be a real task, a test of one\u0027s fervor and vision. Samuel resolved suddenly upon diplomacy.\n\u003cbr\u003e “They\u0027ve been very good to me,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I dare say,” responded the other indifferently.\n\u003cbr\u003e “And Dr. Vince is really a very good man,” he went on.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Humph!” commented the burglar; and then he added quickly, “You haven\u0027t been telling him anything about me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, no!” exclaimed the boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Not a word?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you forgotten that I promised you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “That\u0027s all right,” said Charlie, “only I just wanted to warn you. You can tie up with the church guys if you feel like it—only don\u0027t mention your lost brothers down in the pit. Just you remember that I got some of the doctor\u0027s silver.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The boy gave a start. “Oh!” he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Didn\u0027t you know that?” laughed the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I didn\u0027t know it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What did you suppose I was doing all that time while you were watching?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel said nothing for a minute. “Why did you pick out Dr. Vince?” he asked suddenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Him? Why not? I knew his house.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But a clergyman! Does it seem quite fair?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, that\u0027s all right,” laughed the other. “He\u0027s got a-plenty. It don\u0027t have to come out of his salary, you know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Because, he\u0027s got a rich wife. You didn\u0027t suppose he lived in that palace of a house on his own salary, did you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I hadn\u0027t thought anything about it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, he\u0027s all right—he married one of the richest girls in town. And she\u0027ll keep his nest feathered.”\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a pause. “Don\u0027t you think that Dr. Vince is a good man?” asked Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I don\u0027t know,” said the other. “I\u0027ve got no quarrel with him. But I don\u0027t like his trade.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Doesn\u0027t he do a great deal of good to people?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Maybe,” said the other, shrugging his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e “To poor people?” persisted Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I dare say,” admitted Charlie. “But you\u0027ll notice it takes all the sand out of them—makes them into beggars. And I ain\u0027t that sort.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why do you think he tries to help them?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, he gets paid for it, don\u0027t he?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But the other people in the church—the ones who pay the money. Why do you think they do it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e The burglar thought for a moment. “I reckon they do it to make themselves feel good,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “To make themselves feel good,” repeated the other perplexed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure!” said the man. “You take one of those rich women—she\u0027s got a lot of money that she never earned, and she spends all her life amusing herself and ordering servants about. And all the time she knows that most of the people—the people that do the work—are suffering and dying. And she don\u0027t want to let that make her feel bad, so she hires some fellow like your friend, the doctor, to preach to \u0027em—and maybe give \u0027em a turkey at Christmas. And that takes the trouble off her mind. Don\u0027t you see?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said the other weakly. “I see.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Or else,” added Charlie, “take some of those smooth grafters they\u0027ve got up there—the men, I mean. They spend six days in the week cutting other people\u0027s throats, and robbing the public. Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s handy for them to know they can come on Sunday and drop a five-dollar-bill in the plate, and square the whole account?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel sought for a reply to these cruel taunts. “I don\u0027t think you put it quite fairly,” he protested.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not?” demanded the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e “In the first place, men like that wouldn\u0027t go to church—”\n\u003cbr\u003e Charlie stared at him. “What!” he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” said the boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, why should they care to go? And they wouldn\u0027t be welcome—”\n\u003cbr\u003e Charlie burst into laughter. “You poor kid!” he exclaimed. “What have you been doing up there at St. Matthew\u0027s, anyhow?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I\u0027m the sexton\u0027s assistant,” said Samuel gravely.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said the other. “Evidently a sexton\u0027s assistant doesn\u0027t see much of the congregation.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I wish you\u0027d explain,” remarked the boy after a pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I hardly know where to begin,” replied the other. “They\u0027ve such a choice collection of crooks up there. Did you ever notice a little pot-bellied fellow with mutton-chop whiskers—looks as if he was eating persimmons all the time?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You mean Mr. Hickman?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, that\u0027s the chap. He\u0027s one of the pillars of the church, isn\u0027t he?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I suppose so,” said Samuel. “He\u0027s one of the vestrymen.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “And did you ever hear of Henry Hickman before?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I know he\u0027s a famous lawyer; and I was told that he managed the Lockman estate.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said Charlie, “and I suppose you don\u0027t know what that means!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” admitted Samuel, “I don\u0027t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “It means,” went on the other, “that he was old Lockman\u0027s right-hand man, and had his finger in every dirty job that the old fellow ever did for thirty years. And it means that he runs the business now, and does all the crooked work that has to be done for it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a pause. “For instance, what?” asked Samuel in a low voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e “For instance, politics,” said the other. “Steering the grafters off the Lockman preserve. Getting the right men named by the machine, and putting up the dough to elect them. Last year the Democrats got in, in spite of all he could do; and he had to buy the city council outright.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What!” gasped the boy in horror.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure thing,” laughed Charlie—“there was an independent water company trying to break in, and the Democrats were pledged to them. They say it cost Hickman forty-five thousand dollars.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But do you KNOW that?” cried the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Know it, Sammy? Why everybody in town knows it. It was a rotten steal, on the face of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel was staring at him. “I can\u0027t believe it!” he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Nonsense!” laughed the other. “Ask round a bit!” And then he added quickly, “Why, see here—didn\u0027t you tell me you knew Billy Finnegan—the barkeeper?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, I know him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, then, you can go right to headquarters and find out. His boss, John Callahan, was one of the supervisors—he got the dough. Go and ask Finnegan.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But will he tell?” exclaimed Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess he\u0027ll tell,” said Charlie, “if you go at him right. It\u0027s no great secret—the whole town\u0027s been laughing about it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel was almost too shocked for words. “Do you suppose Dr. Vince knows it?” he cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e “He don\u0027t know much if he doesn\u0027t,” was the other\u0027s reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e “A member of his church!” gasped the boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, pshaw!” laughed the other. “You\u0027re too green, Sammy! What\u0027s the church got to do with business? Why, look—there\u0027s old Wygant—another of the vestrymen!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Miss Gladys\u0027 father, you mean?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes; old Lockman\u0027s brother-in-law. He\u0027s the other trustee of the estate. And do you suppose there\u0027s any rascality he doesn\u0027t know about?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But he\u0027s a reformer!” cried the boy wildly.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure!” laughed Charlie. “He made a speech at the college commencement about representative government; I suppose you read it in the Express. But all the same, when the Democrats got in, his nibs came round and made his terms with Slattery, the new boss; and they get along so well it\u0027ll be his money that will put them in again next year.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But WHY?” cried Samuel dazed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “For one thing,” said Charlie, “because he\u0027s got to have his man in the State legislature, to beat the child-labor bill.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “The child-labor bill!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Surely. You knew he was fighting it, didn\u0027t you? They wanted to prevent children under fourteen from working in the cotton mills. Wygant sent Jack Pemberton up to the Capital for nothing at all but to beat that law.” Samuel sat with his hands clenched tightly. Before him there had come the vision of little Sophie Stedman with her wan and haggard face! “But why does he want the children in his mill?” he cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why?” echoed Charlie. “Good God! Because he can pay them less and work them harder. Did you suppose he wanted them there for their health?”\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a long pause. The boy was wrestling with the most terrible specter that had yet laid hold upon him. “I don\u0027t believe he knows it!” he whispered half to himself. “I don\u0027t believe it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Who?” asked the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Dr. Vince!” said the boy. And he rose suddenly to his feet. “I will go and see him about it,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Go and see him!” echoed Charlie.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes. He will tell me!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Charlie was gazing at him with a broad grin. “I dare you!” he cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I am going,” said the boy simply; and the burglar slapped his thigh in delight.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Go on!” he chuckled. “Sock it to him, Sammy! And come back and tell me about it!”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3245/88943.html","bookId":642,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:26:05 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:26:05 AM"}
