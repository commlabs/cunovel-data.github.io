Hold off on your plans to go into the institute until I get back to you, okay? If you move now, you may alert the folks who are behind this and they\u0027ll probably move that painting. Maybe ship it to California. We\u0027ll never find it if they take it out of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArizona munched on her cigar a couple of times and then nodded decisively. \"All right. I\u0027ll give you a few days to finish your deep background. But if you don\u0027t get anything useful out of Sullivan and Mitch, we\u0027re gonna have to go in. It\u0027s our only option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I\u0027ll be in touch.\" Nick took Octavia\u0027s arm and hauled her up out of the chair. \"Come on, we\u0027ve got work to do, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe honey bemused her a little. She got the feeling that he wasn\u0027t even conscious of having used the endearment. She thought about that while she allowed herself to be dragged from the War Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, a light summer rain was falling. The woods surrounding the fortified cabin were cloaked in a gray mist. Nick hustled her into his car, and then went around the front and got in beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him as he quickly reversed and drove back along the thin, rutted path that served as Arizona\u0027s driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deep background?\" she said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it sounded good. Had a nice military ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did seem to impress Arizona, but you only bought us a little time. What do you expect to accomplish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats me. But I didn\u0027t have much choice. I had to come up with something fast. I definitely do not want to get tangled up in one of Arizona\u0027s little clandestine recon projects at the institute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what Mitch told me, it\u0027s sort of a family tradition. Hannah and Rafe carried out a mission for Arizona and so did Lillian and Gabe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it was just damn good luck that none of them got picked up for illegal trespass.\" Nick turned the wheel and drove out onto the main road. \"I\u0027ve got no intention of following in their illustrious and heroic footsteps, thank you very much. Especially when there\u0027s no reason in hell to think that the painting has been hidden up there at the institute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer small flash of amusement faded. \"But you do believe that it\u0027s still somewhere in town, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He did not take his attention off the road. \"I think whoever took it did it for personal reasons, not for profit. That means it\u0027s probably still somewhere in town. We need to find the source of those rumors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later Nick drove into town, turned onto Bay Street, and parked in the lot at the end of the row of shops. He got out and walked with Octavia to the door of the gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flicker of unease she had experienced a short time ago when Arizona had recounted the scene at Fulton\u0027s returned. Inside the gallery, Gail stood at the counter. She was engaged in an intense conversation with Marjorie Dunne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a ridiculous rumor, Mrs. Dunne,\" Gail said forcefully. \"I can\u0027t imagine who started it, but it has absolutely no basis in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie was clearly not about to be reassured or placated. Clad in tailored slacks and a fashionable cream silk blouse and wearing a lot of gold jewelry, she was, as usual, overdressed for Eclipse Bay. Her blond hair was cut in a short, sophisticated bob that Octavia was pretty sure had not come from Carla\u0027s Custom Cut \u0026amp; Curl. The local beauty shop specialized in two distinctive looks: Very Big Hair and the Senior Citizen Helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Marjorie said, not looking particularly remorseful, just very determined, \"but regardless of whether or not the rumors are true, I must insist that you give me my daughter\u0027s picture. I can\u0027t allow Katy to participate in the art show so long as there\u0027s a cloud hanging over Octavia Brightwell and this gallery. I have to think of my husband\u0027s position in the community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia felt Nick go very still beside her. Alarmed by the anger she sensed humming through him, she stepped forward quickly to defuse the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume this is about the gossip that is going around concerning me,\" she said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail and Marjorie both turned quickly. Gail\u0027s expression was every bit as resolute as Marjorie\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie looked momentarily taken aback at the sight of Nick standing next to Octavia. She started to speak to him, but Gail overrode her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katy will be crushed if her picture isn\u0027t in the show,\" Gail said to Octavia. She gave Marjorie a brief, pointed look. \"I\u0027m sure Mrs. Dunne wouldn\u0027t want her daughter to feel left out because of some stupid gossip. You know how sensitive children are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie flushed a dull red, but she was resolved. \"I\u0027m sorry about this, Octavia. Katy may not understand why I\u0027m doing this, but it\u0027s for her own good. I\u0027m sure you can see my position here. Dunnes have been respected members of this community for three generations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must do what you feel is best for your daughter,\" Octavia agreed. \"It\u0027s unfortunate that you believe the rumor that I stole the Upsall, but that is your choice. I\u0027ll get the picture for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie\u0027s mouth tightened. \"I didn\u0027t say I believed the gossip. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s nothing to it. But it just wouldn\u0027t look good for Katy\u0027s picture to be in the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" Gail fumed. \"The best way to help us squelch that gossip is to allow your daughter\u0027s picture to be exhibited with the others. If you pull it, you\u0027ll just add fuel to the fire and you know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia was touched, but she was not about to let Gail fight this battle for her. \"It\u0027s all right, I\u0027ll get the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe circled the counter, opened the door of the back room, and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about this,\" Marjorie said coldly, \"but it really is not my problem, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends how you look at it, Marjorie,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back room, Octavia winced. Nick was in a dangerous mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie, however, apparently did not recognize the razor-sharp edge of the blade buried in the too-soft words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick.\" She was suddenly overflowing with warmth and cordiality. \"I heard you were in town for the summer. Nice to have you back in Eclipse Bay for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw your latest book on the rack at Fulton\u0027s,\" Marjorie said. \"A very intriguing cover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, indeed. I have an excellent sense of color and design, you know. I\u0027m sure the story is very good, too. I understand you\u0027ve become quite popular. Unfortunately I don\u0027t have much time to read these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I not surprised?\" Nick murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia stifled a groan and hurriedly went to work sorting through the framed paintings to find Katy\u0027s picture. If she didn\u0027t get out there fast, there would be blood on the floor of the gallery. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-52.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
