He couldn\u0027t have done it if I hadn\u0027t made the ink.\"\"What ink? Who?\"\"You shaved.\"\"Yeah. Look bad?\"\"No. You looking good.\"\"Devil\u0027s confusion. What\u0027s this I hear about you not getting out of bed?\"She smiles, lets it fade and turns her eyes back to the window.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I need to talk to you,\" he tells her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She doesn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I saw Denver. She tell you?\"\"She comes in the daytime. Denver. She\u0027s still with me, my Denver.\"\"You got to get up from here, girl.\" He is nervous. This reminds him of something.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I\u0027m tired, Paul D. So tired. I have to rest a while.\"Now he knows what he is reminded of and he shouts at her, \"Don\u0027t you die on me! This is BabySuggs\u0027 bed! Is that what you planning?\" He is so angry he could kill her. He checks himself,remembering Denver\u0027s warning, and whispers, \"What you planning, Sethe?\"\"Oh, I don\u0027t have no plans. No plans at all.\"\"Look,\" he says, \"Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I\u0027m a take care of you, youhear? Starting now. First off, you don\u0027t smell right. Stay there. Don\u0027t move. Let me heat up somewater.\" He stops. \"Is it all right, Sethe, if I heat up some water?\"\"And count my feet?\" she asks him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He steps closer. \"Rub your feet.\"Sethe closes her eyes and presses her lips together. She is thinking: No. This little place by awindow is what I want. And rest. There\u0027s nothing to rub now and no reason to. Nothing left tobathe, assuming he even knows how. Will he do it in sections? First her face, then her hands, herthighs, her feet, her back? Ending with her exhausted breasts? And if he bathes her in sections, willthe parts hold? She opens her eyes, knowing the danger of looking at him. She looks at him. Thepeachstone skin, the crease between his ready, waiting eyes and sees it — the thing in him, theblessedness, that has made him the kind of man who can walk in a house and make the women cry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Because with him, in his presence, they could. Cry and tell him things they only told each other:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　that time didn\u0027t stay put; that she called, but Howard and Buglar walked on down the railroad trackand couldn\u0027t hear her; that Amy was scared to stay with her because her feet were ugly and herback looked so bad; that her ma\u0027am had hurt her feelings and she couldn\u0027t find her hat anywhereand \"Paul D?\"\"What, baby?\"\"She left me.\"\"Aw, girl. Don\u0027t cry.\"\"She was my best thing.\"Paul D sits down in the rocking chair and examines the quilt patched in carnival colors. His handsare limp between his knees.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There are too many things to feel about this woman. His head hurts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Suddenly he remembers Sixo trying to describe what he felt about the Thirty-Mile Woman. \"She is a friend of my mind. She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back tome in all the right order. It\u0027s good, you know, when you got a woman who is a friend of yourmind.\"He is staring at the quilt but he is thinking about her wrought iron back; the delicious mouth stillpuffy at the corner from Ella\u0027s fist. The mean black eyes. The wet dress steaming before the fire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her tenderness about his neck jewelry — its three wands, like attentive baby rattlers, curving twofeet into the air. How she never mentioned or looked at it, so he did not have to feel the shame ofbeing collared like a beast. Only this woman Sethe could have left him his manhood like that. Hewants to put his story next to hers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Sethe,\" he says, \"me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　We need some kind of tomorrow.\"He leans over and takes her hand. With the other he touches her face. \"You your best thing, Sethe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　You are.\" His holding fingers are holding hers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Me? Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678/3795.html","bookId":82,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 3:39:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 3:39:39 AM"}
