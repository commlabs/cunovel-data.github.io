{"id":4944,"no":124,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"The University had been transformed and Hari Seldon could not refrain from being pleased.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The central rooms of the Project complex had suddenly sprouted in color and light, with holography filling the air with shifting three-dimensional images of Seldon at different places and different times. There was Dors Venabili smiling, looking somewhat younger-Raych as a teenager, still unpolished-Seldon and Amaryl, looking unbelievably young, bent over their computers. There was even a fleeting sight of Eto Demerzel, which filled Seldon\u0027s heart with yearning for his old friend and the security he had felt before Demerzel\u0027s departure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The Emperor Cleon appeared nowhere in the holographics. It was not because holographs of him did not exist, but it was not wise, under the rule of the junta, to remind people of the past Imperium.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It all poured outward, overflowing, filling room after room, building after building. Somehow, time had been found to convert the entire University into a display the likes of which Seldon had never seen or even imagined. Even the dome lights were darkened to produce an artificial night against which the University would sparkle for three days.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Three days!\" said Seldon, half-impressed, half-horrified.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Three days,\" said Dors Venabili, nodding her head. \"The University would consider nothing less.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The expense! The labor!\" said Seldon, frowning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The expense is minimal,\" said Dors, \"compared to what you have done for the University. And the labor is all voluntary. The students turned out and took care of everything.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; A from-the-air view of the University appeared now, panoramically, and Seldon stared at it with a smile forcing itself onto his countenance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors said, \"You\u0027re pleased. You\u0027ve done nothing but grouse these past few months about how you didn\u0027t want any celebration for being an old man-and now look at you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Well, it is flattering. I had no idea that they would do anything like this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why not? You\u0027re an icon, Hari. The whole world-the whole Empire-knows about you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"They do not,\" said Seldon, shaking his head vigorously. \"Not one in a billion knows anything at all about me-and certainly not about psychohistory. No one outside the Project has the faintest knowledge of how psychohistory works and not everyone inside does, either.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"That doesn\u0027t matter, Hari. It\u0027s you. Even the quadrillions who don\u0027t know anything about you or your work know that Hari Seldon is the greatest mathematician in the Empire.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Well,\" said Seldon, looking around, \"they certainly are making me feel that way right now. But three days and three nights! The place will be reduced to splinters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No, it won\u0027t. All the records have been stored away. The computers and other equipment have been secured. The students have set up a virtual security force that will prevent anything from being damaged.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ve seen to all of that, haven\u0027t you, Dors?\" said Seldon, smiling at her fondly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"A number of us have. It\u0027s by no means all me. Your colleague Tamwile Elar has worked with incredible dedication.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon scowled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"What\u0027s the matter with Elar?\" said Dors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"He keeps calling me `Maestro.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors shook her head. \"Well, there\u0027s a terrible crime.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon ignored that and said, \"And he\u0027s young.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Worse and worse. Come, Hari, you\u0027re going to have to learn to grow old gracefully-and to begin with you\u0027ll have to show that you\u0027re enjoying yourself. That will please others and increase their enjoyment and surely you would want to do that. Come on. Move around. Don\u0027t hide here with me. Greet everyone. Smile. Ask after their health. And remember that, after the banquet, you\u0027re going to have to make a speech.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I dislike banquets and I doubly dislike speeches.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ll have to, anyway. Now move!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon sighed dramatically and did as he was told. He cut quite an imposing figure as he stood in the archway leading into the main hall. I\u0027he voluminous First Minister\u0027s robes of yesteryear were gone, as were the Heliconian-style garments he had favored in his youth. Now Seldon wore an outfit that bespoke his elevated status: straight pants, crisply pleated, a modified tunic on top. Embroidered in silver thread above his heart was the insignia: SELDON PSYCHOHISTORY PROJECT AT STREELING UNIVERSITY. It sparkled like a beacon against the dignified titanium-gray hue of his clothing. Seldon\u0027s eyes twinkled in a face now lined by age, his sixty years given away as much by his wrinkles as by his white hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He entered the room in which the children were feasting. The room had been entirely cleared, except for trestles with food upon them. The children rushed up to him as soon as they saw him-knowing, as they did, that he was the reason for the feast-and Seldon tried to avoid their clutching fingers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Wait, wait, children,\" he said. \"Now stand back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He pulled a small computerized robot from his pocket and placed it on the floor. In an Empire without robots, this was something that he could expect to be eye-popping. It had the shape of a small furry animal, but it also had the capacity to change shapes without warning (eliciting\u0026nbsp; squeals of children\u0027s laughter each time) and when it did so, the sounds and motions it made changed as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Watch it,\" said Seldon, \"and play with it, and try not to break it.\u0026nbsp; Later on, there\u0027ll be one for each of you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He slipped out into the hallway leading back to the main hall and realized, as he did so, that Wanda was following him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Grandpa,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Well, of course, Wanda was different. He swooped down and lifted her high in the air, turned her over, and put her down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Are you having a good time, Wanda?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" she said, \"but don\u0027t go into that room.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why not, Wanda? It\u0027s my room. It\u0027s the office where I work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s where I had my bad dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I know, Wanda, but that\u0027s all over, isn\u0027t it?\" He hesitated, then he led Wanda to one of the chairs lining the hallway. He sat down and placed her on his lap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Wanda,\" he said, \"are you sure it was a dream?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I think it was a dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Were you really sleeping?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I think I was.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; She seemed uncomfortable talking about it and Seldon decided to let it go. There was no use pushing her any further.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He said, \"Well, dream or not, there were two men and they talked of lemonade death, didn\u0027t they?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Wanda nodded reluctantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"You\u0027re sure they said lemonade?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Wanda nodded again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Might they have said something else and you thought they said lemonade?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Lemonade is what they said.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon had to be satisfied with that. \"Well, run off and have a good time, Wanda. Forget about the dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"All right, Grandpa.\" She cheered up as soon as the matter of the dream was dismissed and off she went to join the festivities.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon went to search for Manella. It took him an extraordinarily long time to find her, since, at every step, he was stopped, greeted, and conversed with.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Finally he saw her in the distance. Muttering, \"Pardon me- Pardon me- There\u0027s someone I must- Pardon me-,\" he worked his way over to her with considerable trouble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Manella,\" he said and drew her off to one side, smiling mechanically in all directions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, Hari,\" she said. \"Is something wrong?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s Wanda\u0027s dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t tell me she\u0027s still talking about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Well, it\u0027s still bothering her. Listen, we have lemonade at the party, haven\u0027t we?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Of course, the children adore it. I\u0027ve added a couple of dozen different Mycogenian taste buds to very small glasses of different shapes and the children try them one after the other to see which taste best. The adults have been drinking it, too. I have. Why don\u0027t you taste it, Hari? It\u0027s great.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m thinking. If it wasn\u0027t a dream, if the child really heard two men speak of lemonade death-\" He paused, as though ashamed to continue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Manella said, \"Are you thinking that someone poisoned the lemonade? That\u0027s ridiculous. By now every child in the place would be sick or dying.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I know,\" muttered Seldon. \"I know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He wandered off and almost didn\u0027t see Dors when he passed her. She seized his elbow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why the face?\" she said. \"You look concerned.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ve been thinking of Wanda\u0027s lemonade death.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"So have I, but I can\u0027t make anything of it so far.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I can\u0027t help but think of the possibility of poisoning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t. I assure you that every bit of food that came into this party has been molecularly checked. I know you\u0027ll think that\u0027s my typical paranoia, but my task is guarding you and that is what I must do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"And everything is-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No poison. I promise you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon smiled, \"Well, good. That\u0027s a relief. I didn\u0027t really think-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Let\u0027s hope not,\" said Dors dryly. \"What concerns me far more than this myth of poison is that I have heard that you\u0027re going to be seeing that monster Tennar in a few days.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t call him a monster, Dors. Be careful. We\u0027re surrounded by cars and tongues.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors immediately lowered her voice. \"I suppose you\u0027re right. Look ;round. All these smiling faces-and yet who knows which of our friends\u0027 will be reporting back to the head and his henchmen when the night is over? Ah, humans! Even after all these thousands of centuries, to think that such base treachery still exists. It seems to me to be so unnecessary. Yet I know the harm it can do. That is why I must go with you, Hari.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Impossible, Dors. It would just complicate matters for me.

You sound exactly like Elar. He, too, is convinced that I am a helpless old fool. He, too, wants to come with me-or, rather, to go in my place. -I wonder how many people on Trantor are willing to take my place,\" he added with clear sarcasm. \"Dozens?
