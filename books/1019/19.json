THE HERMIT RECEIVES A CALL.","content":"Old Anthony was sitting in his doorway, thoughtfully smoking a pipe, when, chancing to lift his eyes, his gaze fell upon the figure of his nephew advancing towards the cabin. It was a surprise, and not a pleasant one. He could not divine Lyman\u0027s object in making this second visit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How are you getting along, Uncle Anthony?\" inquired Lyman, in a conciliatory tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you come all the way from New York to ask me that question?\" said the hermit, dryly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, not altogether. Still, I wanted to know whether you were better.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have got over my rheumatic attack,\" said Anthony, shortly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m very glad. At your age it must be uncomfortable to be sick—especially in such a place. Can\u0027t I persuade you to come to New York, and take comfortable lodgings?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why should you desire it? Perhaps you would propose to live with me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And if I did, being your only relative, it would be natural enough. With your means——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you know of my means?\" demanded the hermit, sharply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have reason to think you are better off than your position would indicate,\" announced Lyman, watching the effect of the assertion on his uncle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What reason?\" inquired Anthony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I know you were very successful in California—after I left you. You struck it rich, made a great deal of money, and then sold the claim for a good round sum.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anthony\u0027s countenance did not change, though the communication was by no means a welcome one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How much of this money do you think I have now?\" he asked, at length.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I don\u0027t propose to tell you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know you have some of it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very possibly. I cannot live for nothing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I know where you keep it,\" added Lyman, provoked by his uncle\u0027s manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I can\u0027t commend your prudence in putting your money where it is so likely to be found—and taken.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Be a little more explicit. Let me know just what you mean.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Burying money in the ground is not very wise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Anthony was taken by surprise, and showed it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you know this? Where did you obtain the information?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From some one who saw you and the boy, Mark, digging for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" said the old man, quietly, \"I know of no better place. People are honest round here, and it will not be taken.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I agree with you there, Uncle Anthony. It won\u0027t be taken for a very good reason. There is none there. The jar is empty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you know this, Lyman?\" demanded the hermit, with a searching look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman hesitated, but it seemed necessary to tell the truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because, when I learned that you had been so imprudent as to let the boy into your secret, I concluded at once that he would take advantage of his knowledge, and rob you. I therefore uncovered the place, and found it as I suspected. The jar is empty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Anthony betrayed no excitement on hearing this.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is quite true,\" he said, quietly. \"All the gold has been taken.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You knew this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly. I took the last gold piece myself. Having no occasion for the jar, I left it there. You are certainly very kind to take so much interest in the safety of my property, but it is needless. I am still able to take care of what money I have left.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman\u0027s face fell. He began to suspect that this was only too true.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53041.html","bookId":1019,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM"}
