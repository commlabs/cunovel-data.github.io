I wondered if I would ever find the smell of food appetizing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rather exciting, isn’t it?” Laura giggled as she touched my arm lightly. “Having a guard, not having enemies, that is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose.” Not long ago, I would have been completely fascinated by any woman with a personal guard. I would have been imagining all sorts of intrigues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Countess Dracula! We meet again!” Percy grinned as he held aloft a plate laden with all sorts of exotic dishes. “I hope you are hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ate earlier,” I lied, but he thrust a plate into my hand before I could protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s overwhelming!” Laura immediately set about filling her own plate while I lingered at her side with my empty one. “Oh, look! Szilvásgombóc!” She served herself a few of the dumplings that were filled with sliced plums and added two to my plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are certainly one of my favorite dishes.” Percy leaned over and placed some heavily spiced pork next to my serving of dumplings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly introduced Percy to Laura, hoping they would ignore my plate and concentrate on their own, but they immediately conspired against me. I soon had such a varied selection of food if I had still been mortal I would have been daunted. As a vampire I could not take even a bite without exposing my nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The one thing I do enjoy immensely in this city is the food. It is so different from our English fare, don’t you think?” Percy guided us to another tent where tables and chairs awaited us. We seated ourselves at a table near the corner. The air was thick with the scent of food and wax candles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is quite different,” I agreed. “Sadly, I have a delicate stomach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A pity,” Percy declared, then dug into his pork and potato dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura smiled sweetly as she tucked into a plate full of mostly desserts. I noted she avoided eating the spicy meat and settled on a potato dish, fruits and her sweets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretended to eat, bringing small portions up to my mouth, but never taking a bite. As the conversation steered away from the buffet to Laura’s recent return from abroad, I found it easier to avoid the food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After my governess married, father sent me to a finishing school,” Laura said around small bites of her dumplings. “Mother attended the same school. She felt it would help me be much more sophisticated and worldly so I could attract a good husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy studied her delicate face before saying, “Perhaps I am just far too old now, but you seem a bit young to marry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am seventeen,” Laura responded with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, a prime age for many young girls to be married off.” Percy nodded his head somberly. “My own wife, Abigail, was not that young when I married her. She was an old maid of twenty-six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did she so deftly avoid marrying for so long?” Laura wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy laughed with amusement. “I take it you dread the prospect of marriage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I desire nothing more than to be a spinster,” Laura admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A noble calling, I dare say.” I grinned at her affectionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy settled back in his chair and gestured at me with an accusing finger. “Shouldn’t you, a happily married woman, be encouraging her toward matrimony?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most certainly I should be, but I will not. A woman should be able to choose her own lot in life, whether or not society, the church, or her family agrees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy’s blue eyes gleamed with merriment and wine as he folded his arms over his chest. “I am in the presence of rebels. What are young women coming to these days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not so horrified as you pretend to be.” Laura helped herself to one of my plum dumplings and nibbled on it as her large eyes regarded Percy with open defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True, true. Abigail refused to marry for comfort. Her family tried so very hard to marry her off to an assortment of suitable types only for her to turn them away. The family was gentry, but had lost most of its money. Abigail became a governess instead of marrying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she married you.” I drew my shawl around my shoulders as I regarded him thoughtfully. I instantly liked him and the more he spoke, the more I suspected we could be friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is because she married for love. Abigail was an idealist and did not believe that marriage, such a sacred union, should be for anything other than love. She was perfectly content with her post when we met by chance while she was on a walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And why hadn’t you married yet?” Laura was clearly enraptured by his tale, her face so very pretty and flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, a man does have a bit more leeway as to when it is a proper time for him to marry, but I shall be honest. I also had no desire to marry if it was not a union based upon love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re a romantic at heart,” I teased\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Completely.” A shadow of sadness flitted over his features, but he quickly sipped his wine to hide it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I have no desire to marry at all. Not even for love. For I shall never love any man.” Laura shrugged her delicate shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should not speak rashly,” Percy warned her. “Some dashing fellow may make you a liar one day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know my mind and heart. No man shall ever take my heart.” Laura’s confidence in her words was mesmerizing. I could clearly see that she believed her words completely. “I shall never marry. I shall never have a child. And I will never love a man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That almost sounds like a curse.” Percy frowned slightly at her. “Do not curse yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am merely declaring my independence. And I don’t believe in curses.” Laura giggled and tilted her head so the moonlight rested on her face and she took on a rather angelic appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used to believe myself to be enlightened until I came to this country. Now I tend to believe in curses and all manner of monsters.” Percy’s gaze lighted upon me for a mere second, but it was long enough for a bit of dread to seep into my consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us continued to talk until Laura’s parents came to claim her and whisk her home. Percy, quite drunk, returned to the city on another boat, but not before asking if he could call on me. I agreed and, soon after, I departed with the Baroness Dosza on her private boat. Though she had not been victorious in her pursuit of Percy, she had managed to cause enough of a ruckus to be pleased with herself. I listened to her ramble on about her spiteful revenge against a reveler while Adem gazed at me solemnly from the side of the boat. I was accustomed to him being my shadow, but tonight I felt annoyed by his presence. It was a reminder that Vlad still influenced my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing that such morose thoughts only stole away my happiness, I relished my new found friendships instead. I was certain that Laura and I would be fast friends and Percy intrigued me. Despite the loss of both my mortal and vampire families, I could not allow myself to become a sad and lonely creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComforted by the prospect of fresh beginnings, I watched the stars glittering on the dark waves of the Danube and felt at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust 2, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace, Buda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI adore the spring and the early summer, but loathe the height of the summer months when the wind grows still and the heat becomes unbearable. Even though I live my life by night, the humidity and heat still linger in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was still mortal, I would have spent many afternoons walking along the Danube, picnicking, and laughing under bright blue skies. Instead, I am heavily tethered to my nighttime existence and only attend the social events that occur once the sun has set. This has made it a bit difficult to nurture my new friendships with Laura and Percy. Happily, both seem committed to forming relationships with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am glad for the camaraderie. Though Magda and Adem have proven to be valuable allies as I carve out a new life for myself in Buda, I often miss my family and friends in England. Though I am haunted while I sleep by the specter of Vlad Dracula, the nightmares fade away when Laura or Percy visits. Though I continue to be social at the encouragement of the Baroness, it is these two friendships that have begun to instill within me a semblance of normalcy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have noted that Adem approves of my mundane life as a mortal countess, and Astir sends me the occasional note of encouragement. Magda also appears content with the new state of things though she despises the baroness. Twice a week, while I sleep, she visits Astir’s haven to see her little boy. I have asked her to bring him to the palace, but she refuses. In Astir’s haven she knows her little boy is truly safe and I cannot blame her for worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy life would be wonderful and complete if Ignatius were here, and I did not have to endure nightmares filled with Vlad Dracula. Astir continues to warn me against contacting my beloved. I do not think I can endure this separation much longer. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-32.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
