But, it worried that once it reached any deeper down, there would be some strange change that would occur. In order to guarantee absolute success, it discarded its hand. If it discarded its hand it would still be able to make up for it by swallowing more essence energy in the future, but if it lost the supreme dragon bone then it was over for it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, Lin Ming felt death creeping ever closer to him.

After punching his chest, Lin Ming had forced out 30% of his blood essence. Once he burnt this, it would greatly reduce his lifespan and affect his future cultivation. But, there was nothing else he could do.

Without enough time to say a single word, the woman had already stretched out a slender white hand towards the claws that were surging with demonic energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Break.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe woman’s red lips opened and a single word emerged, light and ethereal, echoing like the commands of heavenly tribulation.

As for the Asura King, its eyes were wide with disbelief as he stared at this woman that had suddenly appeared from nowhere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You… just who are you?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Asura King was disoriented. The God Beast Mystic Realm was completely sealed off, so where had this marvelous and astonishing woman come from? And looking at her cultivation, she was only at the peak of Sevenfall, moreover, she had deliberately suppressed her cultivation at this realm. Otherwise, she would have already broken into Eightfall. This was something that only extreme cultivation talents would do, so it didn’t seem fake. In addition, this woman was so powerful that there was simply no need for her to fake her cultivation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is she really at the seventh stage of Life Destruction? How can someone at the seventh stage of Life Destruction have such formidable combat strength!

It hadn’t even seen the woman do anything just now. Well, it was more accurate to say that he hadn’t felt a single true essence fluctuation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYes, she didn’t use any true essence at all. All she used was a single thought and a single word. But with just that alone it was like she wielded the Heavenly Dao, striking out with the power of heavenly retribution. With just that, she had shattered the attack that the Asura King had summoned at the coast of discarding his hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe woman simply didn’t spare any attention for the Asura King. She faintly turned her head and glanced at Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs they met eyes, Lin Ming could finally see this woman’s facial features. Her face was indeed Yan Littlemoon’s: young, soft, beautiful, just like a 16-17 year old girl’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, her eyes were completely different.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYan Littlemoon’s eyes were clear and bright like a mountain spring, transparent enough to see the very bottom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut this woman in front of him seemed to fuse together with the space around her. Her pupils seemed to contain the endless galaxies, unfathomable and unimaginable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming even felt as if he could see the Laws of the universe through these eyes. In these eyes, there were countless stars being born and destroyed at the same time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You… are… you are…” Lin Ming stammered out, subconsciously tracing the spot on his chest where the Magic Cube was. He didn’t feel anything there. In fact, ever since the Magic Cube fused into his body, Lin Ming had never been able to feel its existence. If there was any change to the Magic Cube, Lin Ming would not have known either.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, Lin Ming could faintly feel something from this woman, as if they had met somewhere before. This feeling was the same as that white ball of light in the space of the Magic Cube that had floated in the center of the countless star-like memory fragments!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen the Magic Cube absorbed blood essence, the truth was that it had been absorbed by that ball of light!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming was 15 years old, that was when the Magic Cube first invaded his spiritual sea. He had witnessed a dreamlike scene. He saw a woman, her body slender and clothed in white. She stood proud and alone on an endless field of snow, facing 10,000 masters of the Divine Realm!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd of these masters, the worst of them were on the same level as Fairy Feng and the Demon Emperor!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd the stronger ones among them had been at the Holy Lord level!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but there were also those that had reached large success or even the peak of Holy Lord!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd there was even a black-clothed man leading them all. Although Lin Ming wasn’t able to guess his cultivation, he could vaguely make out his strength from how everyone else treated him with utter respect. That black-clothed man was likely infinitely close if not at the World King realm!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd against such a group of powerhouses, a woman, borrowing the power of the Magic Cube, had slain them all with a single move!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of their souls were twisted and shattered!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Lin Ming at that time didn’t know just how terrifying this scene was, nor did he understand the aura of that woman. But, as his strength constantly rose and he understood more and more, he began to realize just how terrifying a character that woman who sacrificed her own soul was!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, as Lin Ming met the eyes of Yan Littlemoon, he had a feeling that they had met somewhere, and the memory that Lin Ming recalled was of that white-clothed woman.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWas it her!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDid she suddenly revive? And she had even occupied Yan Littlemoon’s body!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe woman only peered into Lin Ming’s eyes for a moment. Then, without even saying a single word, she turned back to face the Asura King!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Asura King was stunned at this time. It could feel a terrifying aura from this woman that made his scalp creep. It nearly turned around and fled, but with the supreme dragon bone still in Lin Ming’s hand, it wasn’t willing to give up!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Just who are you?

But, it also didn’t believe that this dreadful woman was brought here by Lin Ming. This was because if a powerhouse wished to enter the God Beast Mystic Realm, they would be limited by the Laws of the world and would need to consume countless violet sun stones to do so. Also, if Lin Ming had prepared such a killing card beforehand, then why hadn’t he used it earlier? Why would the Asura King have been able to chase him and cause him to fall into such a miserable state?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was possible that this woman was some unknown existence in the God Beast Mystic Realm that, due to some unknown reasons, had been residing in some treasure. And, that treasure just happened to have been obtained by Lin Ming somewhere. Thus, the reason for what happened just now. Lin Ming clearly didn’t know who this woman was, so it wasn’t necessarily true that she would help him. It would be fine as long as he could hide the truth of the supreme dragon bone from her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Asura King thought of this, another bolt of fear struck it. It was afraid that Lin Ming would reveal the existence of the supreme dragon bone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the woman heard the Asura King’s words, she turned and looked at the Asura King. There was no change in her expression. She simply parted her cherry red lips again and spoke a single word.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Die.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis voice sounded light and dreamy to Lin Ming, but as it fell onto the ears of the Asura King, it was actually like a thunderclap descended from the highest heavens. The Asura King felt as if the heavens themselves had fallen down on it, causing its entire body to shake and all of its organs to flip over!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ‘Die’ word was not just a simple sound, but it contained the Laws themselves. This sound held an inerrable charm, an order that could not be disobeyed.

The world itself became a volcano that blew up within it and a terrifying buzz overwhelmed its senses, making it dizzy and blind with blood gushing out from its head!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Asura King emitted a miserable cry as it was sent flying back. It could clearly feel that when that woman just attacked, she didn’t use any energy at all. In other words, she didn’t use even a tiny bit of the seventh stage Life Destruction true essence within her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll she used was a sound attack with her battle spirit.

At this time it no longer wished to retake the dragon bone.

In that brief moment after she attacked, she frowned, as if she weren’t satisfied with the damage she had done.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Harden.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnother word, another command that could only be obeyed.
