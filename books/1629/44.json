There\u0027s not mag?ically more of them than there are of us just because they\u0027ve got Brutha, are there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony grabbed his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think logically, will you?” he said. “You\u0027re a phi?losopher, aren\u0027t you? Look at the crowd!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn looked at the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don\u0027t like it,.” Simon turned. “Look, Brutha\u0027s going to die anyway. But this way it\u0027ll mean something. People don\u0027t understand, really under?stand, about the shape of the universe and all that stuff, but they\u0027ll remember what Vorbis did to a man. Right? We can make Brutha\u0027s death a symbol for peo?ple, don\u0027t you see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn stared at the distant figure of Brutha. It was naked, except for a loin-cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A symbol?” he said. His throat was dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered Didactylos saying the world was a funny place. And, he thought distantly, it really was. Here people were about to roast someone to death, but they\u0027d left his loin-cloth on, out of respectability. You had to laugh. Otherwise you\u0027d go mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” he said, turning to Simony. “Now I know Vorbis is evil. He burned my city. Well, the Tsorteans do it sometimes, and we burn theirs. It\u0027s just war. It\u0027s all part of history. And he lies and cheats and claws power for himself, and lots of people do that, too. But do you know what\u0027s special? Do you know what it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” said Simony. \"It\u0027s what he\u0027s doing to-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s what he\u0027s done to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He turns other people into copies of himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony\u0027s grip was like a vice. “You\u0027re saying I\u0027m like him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once you said you\u0027d cut him down,” said Urn. \"Now you\u0027re thinking like him . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we rush them, then?” said Simony. “I\u0027m sure of-maybe four hundred on our side. So I give the signal and a few hundred of us attack thousands of them? And he dies anyway and we die too? What difference does that make?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn\u0027s face was gray with horror now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean you don\u0027t know?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the crowd looked round curiously at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t know?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was blue. The sun wasn\u0027t high enough yet to turn it into Omnia\u0027s normal copper bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha turned his head again, towards the sun. It was about a width above the horizon, although if Didactylos\u0027s theories about the speed of light were correct, it was really setting, thousands of years in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was eclipsed by the head of Vorbis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hot yet, Brutha?” said the deacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Warm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will get warmer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a disturbance in the crowd. Someone was shouting. Vorbis ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing you want to say?” he said. “Can\u0027t you manage even a curse? Not even a curse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never heard Om,” said Brutha. “You never believed. You never, ever heard his voice. All you heard were the echoes inside your own mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? But I am the Cenobiarch and you are going to burn for treachery and heresy,” said Vorbis. “So much for Om, perhaps?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be justice,” said Brutha. “If there is no justice, there is nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was aware of a small voice in his head, too faint yet to distinguish words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Justice?” said Vorbis. The idea seemed to enrage him. He spun around to the crowd of bishops. “Did you hear him? There will be justice? Om has judged! Through me! This is justice!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a speck in the sun now, speeding toward the Citadel. And the little voice was saying left left left up up left right a bit up left-The mass of metal under him was getting uncomfortably hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He comes now,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis waved his hand to the great facade of the temple. “Men built this. We built this,” he said. “And what did Om do? Om comes? Let him come! Let him judge between us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He comes now,” Brutha repeated. “The God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople looked apprehensively upward. There was that moment, just one moment, when the world holds its breath and against all experience waits for a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-up left now, when I say three, one, two, THREE-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vorbis?” croaked Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” snapped the deacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re going to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hardly a whisper, but it bounced off the bronze doors and carried across the Place . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made people uneasy, although they couldn\u0027t quite say why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eagle sped across the square, so low that people ducked. Then it cleared the roof of the temple and curved away towards the mountains. The watchers relaxed. It was only an eagle. For a moment there, just for a moment . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one saw the tiny speck, tumbling down from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t put your faith in gods. But you can believe in turtles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of rushing wind in Brutha\u0027s mind, and a voice . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-obuggerbuggerbuggerhelpaarghnoNoNoAarghBuggerNONOAARGH-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Vorbis got a grip of himself. There had been just a moment, when he\u0027d seen the eagle-but, no . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended his arms and smiled beatifically at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne or two people, who had been watching Vorbis closely, said later that there was just time for his expression to change before two pounds of tortoise, traveling at three meters a second, hit him between the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that does something to people watching. For a start, they believe with all their heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha was aware of feet running up the steps, and hands pulling at the chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a voice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI. He is Mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great God rose over the Temple, billowing and changing as the belief of thousands of people flowed into him. There were shapes there, of eagle-headed men, and bulls, and golden horns, but they tangled and flamed and fused into one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour bolts of fire whirred out of the cloud and burst the chains holding Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eII. He Is Cenobiarch And Prophet of Prophets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of theophany rumbled off the distant mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIII. Do I Hear Any Objections? No? Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloud had by now condensed into a shimmering golden figure, as tall as the Temple. It leaned down until its face was a few feet away from Brutha, and in a whisper that boomed across the Place said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIV. Don\u0027t Worry. This Is Just The Start. You and Me, Kid! People Are Going To Find Out What Wailing and Gnashing Of Teeth Really Is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shaft of flame shot out and struck the Temple doors. They slammed shut, and then the white-hot bronze melted, erasing the commandments of the centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eV. What Shall It Be, Prophet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha stood up, unsteadily. Urn supported him by one arm, and Simony by the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm?” he said, muzzily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVI. Your Commandments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought they were supposed to come from you,” said Brutha. \"I don\u0027t know if I can think of any . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about `Think for Yourself\u0027?” said Urn, staring in horrified fascination at the manifestation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” said Simony. “Try something like `Social Cohesiveness is the Key to Progress.\u0027 ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can\u0027t say it rolls off the tongue,” said Urn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I can be of any help,” said Cut-Me-Own-Hand-Off Dhblah, from the crowd, “something of benefit to the convenience food industry would be very welcome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not killing people. We could do with one like that,” said someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027d be a good start,” said Urn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at the Chosen One. He shook himself free of their grip and stood alone, swaying a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No-oo,” said Brutha. “No. I thought like that once, but it wouldn\u0027t. Not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, he said. Only now. Just one point in history. Not tomorrow, not next month, it\u0027ll always be too late unless it\u0027s now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” said Simony. “What\u0027s wrong with it? You can\u0027t argue with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s hard to explain,” said Brutha. “But I think it\u0027s got something to do with how people should behave. I think . . . you should do things because they\u0027re right. Not because gods say so. They might say something different another time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVII. I Like One About Not Killing, said Om, from far above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIII. It\u0027s Got A Good Ring To It. Hurry Up, I\u0027ve Got Some Smiting To Do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You see?” said Brutha. “No. No smiting. No commandments unless you obey them too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm thumped on the roof of the Temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIX. You Order Me? Here? NOW? ME?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eX.

That part of the crowd that hadn\u0027t managed to stampede from the Place redoubled its efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXI. There Must Be Punishment!

And, perhaps, not for long. It will all happen again. It\u0027s happened before. It happens all the time. That\u0027s why gods die. They never believe in people. But you have a chance. All you need to do is . . . believe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXIII. What? Listen To Stupid Prayers? Watch Over Small Children? Make It Rain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes. Not always.
