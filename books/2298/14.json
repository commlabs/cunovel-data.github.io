Just let me grab my handbag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood on the porch feeling like a teenager on his first date. \"So,\" he said when she reappeared. \"Where would you like to go for dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sea Crest is nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and took his hand. \"That\u0027s okay, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the car door for her, closed it behind her. Walking around to the driver\u0027s side, he suddenly wished he was driving a new convertible instead of a beat-up black Camaro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked about the weather and the possibility of rain on the ride to the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan had the feeling she was holding something back, that she was dying to ask him something but didn\u0027t know how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sea Crest was a nice place. The tables were covered in crisp white cloths. The lighting was soft enough to encourage lovers but not so dark as to discourage families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were paintings of seascapes and tall-masted ships on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hostess, apparently pegging them as lovers, showed them to a small table in a corner. She handed them each a menu, smiled, and left the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan looked around. \"Do you come here often?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki shook her head. \"I\u0027ve only been here once before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A special occasion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A good friend of mine from high school had her wedding supper here two years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reserved the whole place. Must have cost a fortune, but her family could afford it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she still live in Pear Blossom Creek?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they moved to Los Angeles. I keep thinking I\u0027ll go there for a visit one of these days, but… \" She sighed. \"You know how that goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever think about leaving here?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure, all the time, but… \" She shrugged. \"I guess I\u0027m just a small-town girl. All I really want is to get married and settle down. What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been giving that some thought myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that like you\u0027re confessing to some horrible crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, let\u0027s just say it\u0027s not something I ever really planned on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to change the subject, he glanced at the menu. For a restaurant in a town that was only a speck on the map, the Sea Crest had big-city prices. But money was only money, and when he ate, he liked to have the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steak and lobster for me,\" he said. \"How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shrimp and rice,\" Vicki said, closing her menu. \"And a Diet Coke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress appeared a few minutes later and Duncan placed their orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the waitress left, Vicki leaned forward, her arms crossed on the table. \"Can I ask you something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really a bounty hunter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you hunt escaped criminals, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment, debating the wisdom of telling her the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there some reason you don\u0027t believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not.\" She grinned, thinking what a good laugh they would have when she told him what Mrs. Heath had said. \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m telling you this, but a friend of mine thinks she knew a relative of yours who claimed to be a vampire hunter. Isn\u0027t that the silliest thing you\u0027ve ever heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to laugh. When he didn\u0027t, a cold chill ran up her spine. \"Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drummed his fingers on the tabletop, wondering how she would react to the truth. As much as he\u0027d like to tell her a nice lie, she needed to be armed with the truth, to realize that her life was in danger. \"Listen, Vicki… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord, it\u0027s true! You believe in vampires, too, don\u0027t you? You\u0027re as loopy as Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ramona Heath?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking dumbfounded, Tom sat back in his chair. \"My great-grandfather used to talk about her.\" He shook his head. \"I thought the name of the town sounded familiar. I can\u0027t believe she\u0027s still alive. She must be, what, over ninety?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a vampire hunter, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t deny it. \u0027\"Do you want me to take you home?\" She wouldn\u0027t be the first person to shun his company once they found out what he really did for a living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. No. I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. He didn\u0027t look like someone who went around staking vampires or cutting off their heads. He was an ordinary-looking man with broad shoulders and a craggy face and eyes… She looked deep into his eyes and knew that he was telling her the truth. Chat least the truth as he perceived it. He truly believed he was hunting vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why you\u0027re here, isn\u0027t it?\" she asked. \"You think a vampire killed Sharlene and those other women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his expression somber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I saw him. The killer. He didn\u0027t look like a vampire, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan \u0027s whole demeanor changed. She had taken him for a nice, easygoing guy but now she saw the steel beneath his laid-back exterior. His eyes narrowed. A muscle worked in his jaw. \"Where? When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the Blue Horse Tavern on Saturday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a little taller than I am, kind of slim, with blond hair. And yellow eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan swore under his breath. \"Falco. Listen to me, Vicki, whether you want to believe it or not, he\u0027s a vampire. A very old vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki sat back, her mind reeling, not only because of what he was telling her, but because she believed him. In that instant her whole world and much of what she had believed in turned upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But… What\u0027s he doing here, in Pear Blossom Creek?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shrugged. \"Happenstance, maybe. Who the hell knows what a vampire thinks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027s dangerous, I can tell you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he have against redheads?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t say for sure. The story goes that when he was a mortal man, he was engaged to a red-haired woman. It\u0027s said that while they were engaged, she had several lovers and when he found out about it, he killed her and cut off a lock of her hair. Soon after that, there was a string of murders. All the victims had red hair. Soon after that, he was turned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long ago was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. A thousand years ago, give or take a century or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s been killing women all that time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why he\u0027s got to be stopped. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only vaguely aware of the arrival of the waitress with their dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might as well eat,\" Duncan said with a wry grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stared at her plate. Eat? How could he think of food when there was a vampire loose in Pear Blossom Creek? One who had a fondness for killing redheaded women?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Duncan cut into his steak. Juice oozed in the wake of the knife, reminding her of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling suddenly nauseous, she glanced out the window, felt her insides go cold when she saw a pair of glowing yellow eyes staring back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki gasped, one hand flying to her throat. He was here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Duncan asked, his gaze darting around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out there! He\u0027s here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s here?\" Duncan asked. And then he knew. Swiveling around in his chair, he stared out the window. \"I don\u0027t see anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was there. I saw him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan reached for her hand. \"It\u0027s all right, Vicki. Take a deep breath. That\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re safe in here with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took several deep breaths, her gaze constantly darting to the window. She wanted to believe she had imagined it, but she hadn\u0027t. Those horrible yellow eyes had been watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan handed her a glass of water. \"Here, drink this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what good drinking a glass of water would do, but she was too upset to argue. Surprisingly, doing something so ordinary calmed her a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to… to… \" She couldn\u0027t say the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as soon as I find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that shouldn\u0027t be too hard. He\u0027s right out there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s probably long gone by now. Besides, hunting vampires after dark is a risky business. I prefer to do it when the sun\u0027s up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where he stays during the day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027ll find him. It\u0027s just a matter of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, time,\" she murmured, and hoped that Tom found the vampire before the vampire found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll get him.\" Duncan squeezed her hand. \"Do you want to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he crazy? The way she felt right now, she wasn\u0027t leaving this place until the sun was up. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom regarded her for a moment, then picked up his knife and fork and began to eat his dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing out a breath, Vicki speared one of the shrimp on her plate, thinking that if this was going to be her last meal, at least it would be a good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they finished dinner, Tom asked if she would like to take a walk, but Vicki shook her head. She was never going to feel safe out on the streets after dark again, not as long as that fiend was somewhere out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go back to my place for dessert,\" she suggested. \"I made a cake today.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-14.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
