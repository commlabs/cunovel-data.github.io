Why? Did Cousin Snotty say I did? Listen, there were vicious dogs chasing me--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at the mutt who hasn\u0027t figured out my feet aren\u0027t his personal playground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that one?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake the thing off my leg. \"No. Yes. Well, they looked like him, but were a lot bigger. And so I ran and sort of fell on Snotty\u0027s boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is O. S. N. A. T. Osnat. It\u0027s a beautiful name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not where I come from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just...just give her a chance. Don\u0027t judge her before you get to know her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to argue, to tell SD Snotty hated me before she knew me, but I\u0027m keeping silent. Right now I\u0027ll attribute my lack of ability to argue to sleep deprivation because usually I\u0027m ready for a good knockdown-dragout verbal war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And stop calling her Snotty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeez, you give the guy a little and like a vacuum cleaner he wants to take up all the dirt, not just the little pieces of lint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Where\u0027s Sofia?. I\u0027m ready to meet her now if there aren\u0027t any spectators around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s resting in her room. No spectators, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be about the time I have the urge to hug the SD. But it would feel weird because I haven\u0027t hugged him in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSD stands and I follow him into the house. Once we enter, the smell of fresh baked bread wafting from the kitchen makes my stomach growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come eat,\" Dodo Yucky says. She\u0027s lost a bit of her cheery disposition. Is it because she thinks I kissed O.S.NAT\u0027s boyfriend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, but I\u0027m not hungry.\" I\u0027m too nervous to eat. Ron leads me to a small room at the back of the house and I peek in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSofia is lying down on her bed. When she sees me enter, she sits up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard and close the door behind me. The room is small, the floor is made of tile, and the walls are stark white cement. The drapes are closed, so it\u0027s a little dark. But that\u0027s the way I want it now, because I don\u0027t want the world peeking into my conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Sofia. I\u0027m Amy,\" I say. My voice cracks while I\u0027m saying it and I feel a little foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and pats the side of the bed. \"Come over here, Amy. Sit with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take small, slow steps to her bed. When I reach it, I carefully sit on the edge. To my surprise, she takes my hand in hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really sick?\" I ask tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine. You know doctors, they like to make a big fuss about nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron thinks you\u0027re real sick,\" I say, and then want to suck those words right back in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"Your father needs to have his cup examined. That means \u0027head\u0027 in Yiddish. Imagine, keeping my granddaughter from me for sixteen years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say, urging her on. I like Safta immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your mother like?\" she asks, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I describe Mom?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s pretty, for a mom,\" I say. \"And she has a job that pays her a lot of money. She doesn\u0027t have a lot of friends, though, \u0027cause she\u0027s always working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as Safta takes this all in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tell me about yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do okay in school, I guess. My best friend\u0027s name is Jessica ...she\u0027s Jewish,\" I add to make some connection to Safta on the religious end. \"And I like to play tennis, ski, and shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods her head. \"I\u0027m going to like getting to know you, Amy. You sound like a very energetic, interesting girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should add I don\u0027t have the most positive attitude,\" I say while biting my bottom lip nervously. I mean, the lady\u0027ll figure it out sooner or later so I might as well give it to her straight up front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe your trip here will change that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI highly doubt it but I say, \"I guess so,\" just to make her think this trip might miraculously change my outlook on life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was like you when I was your age,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Were you illegitimate, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says, still holding my hand. \"But my family fell on some tough times and we didn\u0027t have a home for a few years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the beach. It was a long time ago. Life changes when you least expect it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs this information sinks into my brain, Sofia tells me to go relax and unpack. And she smiles at me as if she\u0027s been my grandmother forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t keep blaming her for not being there for me the past sixteen years. The poor woman didn\u0027t even know I existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s my suitcase?\" I ask Ron after my enlightening talk with Sofia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s in O\u0027snot\u0027s room,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t just hear right. I couldn\u0027t have. \"You\u0027re kiddin\u0027 me, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only a few rooms here,\" SD explains. \"You\u0027ll be sleeping in O\u0027snot\u0027s room. I\u0027m getting the sofa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the little guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matan? He sleeps on a bed in his parents\u0027 room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to suggest I sleep on the floor, but I see three ants crawling across the tile. Gross. And when I look over at Doda Yucky, she has this pathetic look on her face as if she\u0027ll win the lottery if my happy meter reaches a certain level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a little smile and it apparently worked because she heads back to the kitchen humming a cheerful tune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut seriously, if there\u0027s one thing an American teenage girl needs, it\u0027s privacy. Can I tell O\u0027snot to leave the room? It is, in fact, HER room so I think not. Thank goodness I\u0027m not a twin. There are these twins at my school, Marlene and Darlene, and they have to not only share a room with each other, but their older sister, Charlene too. Don\u0027t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSD leads me to a bedroom in the back of the house. I walk in the room and Snotty is putting on makeup while sitting on her bed. She knows I\u0027m there, but she hasn\u0027t acknowledged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sperm Donor stands beside me. \"Do you need help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m fine,\" I say back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes this as his cue to leave. I would have liked him to stay. Only to pose as a buffer between me and Snotty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, I\u0027m sorry about your boyfriend,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up and I see she\u0027s overdone the makeup on her eyes. It\u0027s as if she\u0027s outlined her eyes in black charcoal and now my cousin looks like she\u0027s in her twenties instead of a teenager. How old is she, anyway? She could use a few tips on makeup application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my mom\u0027s clients is a cosmetic company. They actually used me in one of the shoots for their teen line. I learned a lot about how makeup should enhance your best features and not look all gloppy and dark (like Snotty). After my picture appeared in most of the teen magazines, my group of friends kind of dubbed me the guru of makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go over to my suitcase on the bed I suppose is mine for the next three months and pick out some clothes to change into that aren\u0027t caked with mud and straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi isn\u0027t my boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s Snotty talking, or my imagination playing with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI face my cousin. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points her charcoal eye-circle bull\u0027s-eyes in my direction. \"I don\u0027t have a boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a pair of red shorts out of my suitcase. The word BITCH is printed across the butt in big white letters. Jessica got me the shorts for my birthday as a joke along with an anklet that wasn\u0027t a joke. I never thought I\u0027d ever wear the shorts but then again, I never thought I\u0027d find myself on a farm on top of a mountain in the middle of a war zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, to be perfectly honest with myself, Israel doesn\u0027t actually feel or look like a war zone. Well, except for the heavily armed guards at the airport and the minefield I stepped on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at my shorts. I didn\u0027t think anyone here would be able to speak English so I packed them. I\u0027m tempted to offer them to Snotty but instead ask, \"Does Avi have a girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, now if I wouldn\u0027t gag from the grossness of it, I\u0027d insert my foot into my mouth. I don\u0027t care whether the guy has a girlfriend or not, but here I am asking Snotty about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes my mouth gets me going in a direction I have no intention of heading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s worse is my cousin ignores my question. So even if I didn\u0027t mean to ask the question, I\u0027m more curious than ever to know the answer. But I\u0027d never give her the satisfaction of asking her about Avi twice. She\u0027s already been spreading false rumors I\u0027ve been mashing with the guy. It would suck if she really thought I cared what his girlfriend status was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my clothes out on the bed, and head for the ONE bathroom in the whole house. I\u0027m trying not to think about living for the next three months in a house with seven people and one bathroom. Scary, isn\u0027t it? At home we have three bathrooms ...and it\u0027s only me and mom living there (along with Marc with a \"c\" when he stays over).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have this friend, Emily. She\u0027s obsessed with smelling EVERYTHING. Like, when she eats she smells each bite before she puts the food into her mouth. I hate having meals with her because every time I hear her sniff-eat-sniff-eat-sniff-eat I get extremely irritated. Nobody really likes me when I\u0027m irritated, except maybe Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I enter the bathroom, my gag meter indicates low readings of any smells other than the ones emanating from my own body. Man, Emily would have a field day with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am SO looking forward to getting clean. Thinking about how long it\u0027s been since I took a shower is making me dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the door to the bathroom and look on the handle for a lock. But the problem is there isn\u0027t one. Just a hole, as if there was a lock at one point in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t funny. There are seven people living in this house and no lock on the bathroom door. And the damn door has a peephole where a lock should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to get into bed fast so this day can be over. I don\u0027t want to undress in front of a peephole so I step into the tub, close the curtain, and take my clothes off. I figure out how to turn on the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully a spray of hot water comes hard and fast. I can\u0027t stop the moan from escaping my mouth. Hot showers rock. I\u0027m so tired I can hardly stand so I quickly wash myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shower I head back to Snotty\u0027s room, wondering why I didn\u0027t bring a change of clothes with me to the bathroom-that-doesn\u0027t-lock. I sure as hell don\u0027t want to change in front of Snotty. As I\u0027m thinking about where to change into pjs, I wrap the towel tightly around myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to make eye contact with her, \u0027cause I want to avoid having to make any positive facial gestures, like smiling. I don\u0027t have any positive facial gestures left, at least not any today. In fact, all my positive gestures are probably used up for tomorrow, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I look down at the floor as I enter the room, close the door, and head straight for my suitcase. I know Snotty is still in the room, I can hear her breathing. I pull a tank top and underwear out of my suitcase. I can go back to the bathroom and feel like a big dork that I\u0027m embarrassed to change in front of her or I can just suck it up and change right here with my back turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop the towel and put my underwear on. Then I put on the BITCH shorts. When I reach for my white tank top, the door opens. I quickly cover my large breasts with my tank and get ready to yell at the intruder. The intruder, I assume, is none other than SD. \"Do you mind?\" I say. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-6.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
