A wizard, if you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought… you said you were a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did, didn\u0027t I? I\u0027m afraid I lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. West, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve told lies from time to time. It\u0027s a fact of life that we sometimes have to lie to get what we want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest glanced at the front door. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You. For a little experiment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way! I\u0027m outta here!\" With a shake of his head, Roger West started toward the front door, only to find that he no longer had control over his body. He looked back at Loken, his eyes wild and scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come along,\" Loken said, beckoning to him with his forefinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest shook his head. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere with you,\" he retorted, but his feet were following the warlock down a long dark hall, down a flight of stairs, into the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Climb up on the table,\" Loken said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you!\" West cried as he obeyed the warlock\u0027s bidding. \"Let me go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie down. This won\u0027t take long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger West stretched out on the table, his heart pounding. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u0027t move, had no control over his own movements. Sweat broke out across his brow, gathered under his arms. \"Please, let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late.\" Loken pulled a vial out of his coat pocket and removed the seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling a syringe from the drawer of a large tool chest, he filled it with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest stared at him in horror. \"What… what are you going to do with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a test. For all I know, it just might turn you into a vampire. Then again, it might kill you,\" he said with a wicked grin. \"Or give you eternal life. But we won\u0027t know until we try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken wrapped a strip of rubber around West\u0027s upper arm, then poked around for a vein. Finding a good one, he inserted the needle and pushed the plunger home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest stared at the blood flowing into his arm, and then looked at Loken. And then he screamed, his body writhing in agony as the vampire\u0027s blood seeped into his bloodstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Loken said. \"Tell me what you feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It burns, it burns,\" the young man said, whimpering. \"Make it stop… make it… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up at Loken, saliva dripping from a corner of his mouth. His body convulsed one last time and then lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit!\" Grabbing the boy\u0027s wrist, Loken felt for a pulse. It was strong but irregular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping the boy\u0027s arm, Loken sat down to wait for the final outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan prowled the outside of the warlock\u0027s laboratory, his senses testing the night. Loken had been there earlier that evening but there was no indication that Roger West had been with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had Loken taken the boy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, he dissolved into mist and entered the building. The laboratory was empty. Jimmy Dugan\u0027s body was gone, though the smell of fear and blood and death lingered in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the building, Roshan regained his own shape. If Loken wasn\u0027t here, then he must have taken Roger West home. But why there and not here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought took him to the warlock\u0027s house. As soon as he neared the front door, he caught the heavy scent of the boy\u0027s fear. They were here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wondering how he might gain access to the house when he heard a faint scream from the direction of the basement. Roshan cursed softly as a second scream reached his ears. It was a cry of such torment that it seared his soul. And then it came again, a wordless cry of agony, a heartrending plea for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven knowing he couldn\u0027t enter the warlock\u0027s house without an invitation, Roshan couldn\u0027t resist the urge to go to the boy\u0027s aid. Using his preternatural powers to unlock and open the door, he took a step forward, only to be repelled by the power of the threshold and the wards the warlock had set around the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan swore softly; then, knowing there was nothing he could do to save the boy, he transported back to the Nocturne and called the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger West\u0027s head rocked back and forth as Loken\u0027s knife cut into his flesh. The stink of his own waste filled his nostrils, mingling with the scent of his blood. Nausea roiled in West\u0027s stomach. So much blood. So much pain. He tried to summon the energy to move, the strength to free himself from the warlock\u0027s power, but it was futile. He could only lay there, helpless and afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken watched through unblinking eyes as blood flowed from the deep gash he had made in the boy\u0027s forearm. \"The wound isn\u0027t healing. It appears an injection doesn\u0027t work,\" he said, thinking aloud. \"Perhaps the blood has to be ingested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling another vial out of his coat pocket, he lifted the boy\u0027s head and held the vial to his lips. \"Drink this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to resist, Roger West opened his mouth and swallowed the thick red fluid, only to vomit it up again. It ran down his chin and chest, sprayed over Loken\u0027s shirt, dripped from the table to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCursing, Loken jumped out of the way. \"You will drink this and you will keep it down,\" he said, and pulling a third vial from his pocket, he held it to the boy\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you,\" West said weakly. But he drank the contents of the vial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll give it a chance to work,\" Loken said, glancing at his watch. \"Perhaps an hour or two.\" Tearing a strip of cloth from the boy\u0027s shirt, he used it to gag the boy, then strapped his arms and legs to the table. \"Rest while you can,\" Loken said, and turning off the lights, he left the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the living room, he was about to go into the kitchen for a bottle of beer when he felt a draft. Walking toward the entry, he saw that the front door was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, he gathered his power and murmured an incantation. A moment later, a shadowy image took shape on the porch. He recognized it instantly. Roshan DeLongpre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken grunted softly. What had DeLongpre been doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still considering the possibilities when a police car pulled up in the driveway. Two policeman, both young, got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken stepped out onto the porch. \"Good evening, officers,\" he said with a congenial smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Anthony Loken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a report that screams were heard coming from this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be mistaken. I\u0027ve been here all night and I\u0027ve heard nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you live alone, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\" He smiled again. \"The only screams heard here tonight came from my television set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind if we look around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken shook his head. \"Help yourself.\" He took a step back, allowing them entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the officers went to search the house. The second policeman stayed with Loken, one hand resting on the butt of his revolver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I offer you something to drink?\" Loken asked. \"A cup of coffee, or a soda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoken nodded. He listened to the footsteps of the first officer as he moved through the house. There was nothing to worry about. The door to the basement was invisible, protected by a recent enchantment no mere mortal could detect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps five minutes passed before the first officer returned to the living room. \"Let\u0027s go, Frank, there\u0027s nothing here. Sorry to have bothered you, Mr. Loken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s quite all right.\" Anthony followed the two officers to the front door and watched them leave. He even waved as they pulled away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he closed and locked the door. Something would have to be done about Mr. Roshan DeLongpre, he mused. Something permanent. And painful. And then he smiled. Perhaps Mr. DeLongpre could take the boy\u0027s place in the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhistling softly, he went downstairs to see how his latest experiment was coming along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna waited up until after midnight and still Roshan didn\u0027t come home. It never took him this long to feed. Where was he? She didn\u0027t like the answer that came to mind. He was a handsome man gifted with the preternatural allure of a vampire. Women looked at him wherever they went… She shook her head, refusing to entertain the thought that he might be with another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving through the rooms downstairs, she turned off all the lights but one, then went upstairs to get ready for bed. Morgana trailed at her heels, meowing reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndressing, Brenna pulled her nightgown over her head, then slipped into bed. Morgana curled up beside her, one paw resting on her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning on her side, Brenna gazed out the window, one hand idly stroking Morgana\u0027s head. Even though she was growing used to life in this century, Brenna sometimes wished she were back home. Life had been so much simpler there. Harder in many ways, but simpler nevertheless. There was still so much in this century that she didn\u0027t fully understand. Wars in places she had never heard of. Diseases that were unknown in her time. Inventions like the washing machine that made doing the laundry easier but somehow robbed her of the satisfaction of washing her clothes by hand. The dryer dried her clothes quickly but they lacked the fresh smell of clothing dried in the sun. With so little to do, the days seemed longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps she needed to find a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more she thought about it, the more she liked the idea of earning her own money. But what could she do? She wasn\u0027t qualified to work in an office. She didn\u0027t have a college education, but surely there was something she could do. \"What do you think, Morgana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of her head, Morgana rolled onto her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps Myra would give me a job at the bookstore,\" Brenna said, thinking aloud. \"Maybe I could sell books or wait tables. Of course, he would not like it\" She scratched Morgana\u0027s tummy for a few minutes, and then smiled a conspiratorial smile. \"Of course, there is no need for us to tell Mr. DeLongpre.\" Her smile faded. \"Perhaps the bookstore is not the right place to look for employment. Mr. Loken visits there all too often.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-33.html","bookId":2299,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM"}
