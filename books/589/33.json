{"id":30715,"no":33,"title":"THE JUDGMENT OF BABOON","content":"One day, it is said, the following story happened:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mouse had torn the clothes of Itkler (the tailor), who then went to Baboon, and accused Mouse with these words:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In this manner I come to thee: Mouse has torn my clothes, but will not know anything of it, and accuses Cat; Cat protests likewise her innocence, and says, \u0027Dog must have done it\u0027; but Dog denies it also, and declares Wood has done it; and Wood throws the blame on Fire, and says, \u0027Fire did it\u0027; Fire says, \u0027I have not, Water did it\u0027; Water says, \u0027Elephant tore the clothes\u0027; and Elephant says, \u0027Ant tore them.\u0027 Thus a dispute has arisen among them. Therefore, I, Itkler, come to thee with this proposition: Assemble the people and try them in order that I may get satisfaction.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus he spake, and Baboon assembled them[119] for trial. Then they made the same excuses which had been mentioned by Itkler, each one putting the blame upon the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Baboon did not see any other way of punishing them, save through making them punish each other; he therefore said,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mouse, give Itkler satisfaction.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mouse, however, pleaded not guilty. But Baboon said, \"Cat, bite Mouse.\" She did so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He then put the same question to Cat, and when she exculpated herself, Baboon called to Dog, \"Here, bite Cat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In this manner Baboon questioned them all, one after the other, but they each denied the charge. Then he addressed the following words to them, and said,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wood, beat Dog.\n\u003cbr\u003e Fire, burn Wood.\n\u003cbr\u003e Water, quench Fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e Elephant, drink Water.\n\u003cbr\u003e Ant, bite Elephant in his most tender parts.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They did so, and since that day they cannot any longer agree with each other.[120]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ant enters into Elephant\u0027s most tender parts and bites him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Elephant swallows Water.\n\u003cbr\u003e Water quenches Fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e Fire consumes Wood.\n\u003cbr\u003e Wood beats Dog.\n\u003cbr\u003e Dog bites Cat.\n\u003cbr\u003e And Cat bites Mouse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Through this judgment Itkler got satisfaction and addressed Baboon in the following manner:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes! Now I am content, since I have received satisfaction, and with all my heart I thank thee, Baboon, because thou hast exercised justice on my behalf and given me redress.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Baboon said, \"From to-day I will not any longer be called Jan, but Baboon shall be my name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Since that time Baboon walks on all fours, having probably lost the privilege of walking erect through this foolish judgment.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65532.html","bookId":589,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 2:31:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 2:31:50 AM"}
