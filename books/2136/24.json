A girl. I told her to get help. She stared at me for a moment, then took off running, her feet pounding along the polished tiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to my CPR, doing all I could to get Cal\u0027s heart beating, to get him breathing again, and by the time the first adults arrived - Junior and his wife, followed shortly by Tara and Allison - I was certain that Cal was quite dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, Sam, what happened? asked Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all sitting in the great room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll seventeen of us. Cal was still in the library, lying under a sheet. Further attempts to resuscitate him had gone for naught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre your thoughts protected? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething killed him. I watched it kill him. I\u0027m seriously freaked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison snapped her head around and stared at me. She wasn\u0027t the only one who stared at me. Most people in the room were looking at me. Also in the room was Tara. I\u0027d been too busy and shaken to notice when she\u0027d returned. Edwin hadn\u0027t stopped looking my direction. The sky beyond the big windows was a nasty gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the day\u0027s raindrops had begun to splatter against the glass. Jagged bolts of lightning occasionally lit up the underbelly of the heavy clouds. Junior, who had been on his cell phone in the hallway, came into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Island County Sheriff can\u0027t make it out today,\" he reported. He looked ten years older than when I\u0027d last seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had, after all, just lost his uncle. \"Nor can the paramedics, nor anyone else, for that matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" asked a little girl. She was, I knew, one of Junior\u0027s granddaughters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the storm, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was holding my phone. I wanted to text Fang. To text Kingsley even. I didn\u0027t feel comfortable texting Russell yet. The poor guy was just beginning to know me. I couldn\u0027t lay something like this on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was I supposed to say? That I\u0027d seen some dark entity strangle a man? For a new relationship, that might be a deal breaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang would have understood, and so would\u0027ve Kingsley. Hell, so would have Detective Sherbet. For now, I was left with only Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGee thanks, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops, I thought. You know what I mean. The others are, you know...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreaky like you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the wind had clearly picked up. The tall evergreens were once again swaying and bending. Rain splattered harder, driven into the window. A lawn chair outside scuttled over the grounds, rolling like a tumbleweed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you really watch him die, Sam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, and I\u0027m still shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a glimpse of my own memory of the event, reliving the moment the darkness appeared from his aura and reached up to his throat. I relived his last few words, too: \"It has us all, Samantha. It controls us all. We are not free. We are never free...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, came Allison\u0027s reply. Was he poisoned?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe, I thought. But I suspected it was something else, something that I didn\u0027t entirely understand, but it had to do with his last words to me: It controls us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison, who\u0027d been following my train of thought as best she could, formulated the words that I had been searching for: Sam, you think that, on some level, that whatever has control over Edwin, also had control over Cal? But not just the two of them, I thought grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them? asked Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior turned his attention to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Samantha, I can\u0027t express to you how thankful I am for your efforts on behalf of my uncle. I\u0027m sure that you did all you could to save his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t do more,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, exactly, did you do?\" asked Patricia, Junior\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aura, I noted, was not rippled with the same black ribbon I had seen in some of the others. Her aura was a biting green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to speak, but instead, looked around me. Junior, I noted, had a black ribbon woven through his aura. I looked again at Edwin: the same black ribbon. I looked at the kids. They all had black ribbons, some thicker than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them. I\u0027d never seen this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot like this, and not in the same pattern, and not with so many people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was going on? I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Standard CPR,\" I said, finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you learn this standard CPR?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over at Tara. She was holding her breath. I glanced over at Edwin. He was grinning knowingly. The jig, I was quite certain, was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"At the FBI Academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a federal agent, Samantha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior, who had been standing, stepped threateningly before me, arms crossed. \"Then what the hell are you, Samantha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at Tara, who was standing near the arched opening into the great room. Her aura, I noted, was still rippled with the same black ribbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a private investigator,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my name\u0027s Samantha Moon.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-24.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
