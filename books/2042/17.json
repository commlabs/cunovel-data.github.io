In fact, I nearly forgot that I was supposed to be taking us to Wolfe\u0027s and showing Adrian how to use a stick shift. Instead, I was caught up in the way the engine hummed around us and in the scent of the leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving his neighborhood, I had to restrain myself from flooring it in the crowded streets of downtown Palm Springs. This was a car screaming to be let loose on the open road. I had admired Brayden\u0027s Mustang, but I worshipped this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like I\u0027ve just crashed someone\u0027s date,\" Adrian remarked, once we were getting on the highway. No one had tailed us out of downtown, making me feel much safer. \"Like I\u0027m intruding on you two. If you want to drop me off somewhere, I\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been paying careful attention to the way the car built up to higher speeds, both through sound and feel. The Mustang was in stunning shape. People often have the idea that classic cars are expensive. They are - if they\u0027re in good condition. Most aren\u0027t. When something\u0027s sat around for years without care, it inevitably falls apart, which is why so many older cars are fixer-uppers. Not Adrian\u0027s. This had been maintained and restored throughout the years and had probably never left the state of California - meaning it hadn\u0027t faced harsh winters. That all added up to a high price tag, making it that much more ludicrous that Adrian had bought something he couldn\u0027t drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned. \"I\u0027m sorry... I don\u0027t know what I was thinking.\" Well, I kind of knew. I\u0027d been wondering what my odds of a ticket would be if I broke the speed limit to see how fast we could go. \"I should\u0027ve been walking you through this as soon as I started the car. I promise I will when we leave Wolfe\u0027s, all the steps. For now, I guess we can recap the basics. This is the clutch...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian didn\u0027t seem annoyed by my neglect. If anything, he looked amused and simply listened to my explanations with a small, quiet smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfe looked just as disreputable as he had last time, complete with the eye patch and what I suspected were the same Bermuda shorts as before. I hoped he\u0027d done laundry since then. Despite his appearance, he was ready to go when our class assembled and seemed competent in his subject matter. Although he reminded us again about the importance of avoiding conflicts and being aware of one\u0027s surroundings, he quickly moved past those points and focused on actually practicing more physical ways of protecting oneself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering how much Adrian had complained last time about the \"boring\" safety talk, I figured he\u0027d be excited that we were pretty much jumping right into some action. Instead, that amused look from the car vanished, and he grew increasingly tense as Wolfe explained what he wanted us to do in our partnered practice sessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the time actually came to practice, Adrian looked blatantly unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" I asked. I suddenly remembered last time, when Adrian had freaked out over my \"attack.\" Maybe he hadn\u0027t really expected he\u0027d have to work here. \"Come on, these are simple. You won\u0027t get dirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when teaching more combative actions, Wolfe was still an advocate of keeping things fast and simple. We weren\u0027t trying to learn to beat someone up. These maneuvers were effective means of distracting an assailant so that we could escape. Most were done with the dummies, since we could hardly try to stick fingers in each other\u0027s eyes. Adrian went through those motions diligently, if silently. It was working directly with me that he seemed to have a problem with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfe noticed it too as he made his rounds. \"Come on, boy! She can\u0027t try to escape if you don\u0027t try to hold her. She\u0027s not going to hurt you, and you won\u0027t hurt her.\" The maneuver in question was actually one that would\u0027ve been helpful the night I\u0027d been grabbed in the alley. So, I was eager to practice it and frustrated that Adrian kept only halfheartedly helping. He was supposed to put an arm around my torso and attempt to cover my mouth. Unfortunately, his efforts were so weak and his hold so loose that I didn\u0027t need any special techniques to escape. I could have simply walked right out of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Wolfe there, Adrian made a slightly better showing as an assailant but immediately resorted to his former ways once we were alone. \"Let\u0027s switch,\" I said at last, nearly wanting to pull my hair out. \"You try to escape me. Make up for last time.\" I couldn\u0027t believe that Adrian\u0027s sluggish attitude had turned out to be the problem here. I\u0027d expected the hang-up would be me not wanting to touch a vampire, but it didn\u0027t bother me at all. I wasn\u0027t thinking of him as a vampire. He was Adrian, and my partner in this class. I needed him to learn the move. It was all very pragmatic. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d almost say that Adrian was afraid to touch me, which made no sense. Moroi didn\u0027t have those hang-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas something wrong with me? Why wouldn\u0027t Adrian touch me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" I demanded, once we were in the car and headed back to the city. \"I get that you\u0027re not an athlete, but what happened in there?\" Adrian refused to meet my eyes and instead stared pointedly out the window. \"I don\u0027t think this is really my thing. I was all about playing action hero before, but now... I don\u0027t know. This is a bad idea. It\u0027s more work than I thought.\" There was a flippant, dismissive tone in his voice that I hadn\u0027t heard in a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you finishing things you started?\" I asked. \"You told me you had changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was for art,\" said Adrian quickly. \"I\u0027m still in those classes, aren\u0027t I? I didn\u0027t jump ship on those. I just don\u0027t want to do this one anymore. Don\u0027t worry. Now that I\u0027ve got more money, I\u0027ll pay you back the class fee. You won\u0027t be out anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter,\" I argued. \"It\u0027s still a waste! Especially since what Wolfe\u0027s showing us isn\u0027t really that difficult. We\u0027re not ripping ourselves apart like Eddie and Angeline would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this so hard for you to stick with and learn?\" My earlier self-doubt returned. \"Do you just not want to work with me? Is there... is there something wrong with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Of course not. Absolutely not,\" said Adrian. In my periphery, I saw him finally look at me. \"Maybe there are only so many things I can learn at once. I mean, I\u0027m supposed to also be learning to drive a stick shift. Not that I see that happening.\" I wanted to slap myself on the forehead. In my frustration over class, I\u0027d completely forgotten again about showing Adrian how to drive. I felt like an idiot, even though I was still mad at him for giving up on Wolfe. I checked the time. I had things to do tonight at Amberwood but felt obligated to make up for my shoddy teaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll practice once we\u0027re back in your neighborhood,\" I promised. \"We\u0027ll start slow, and I\u0027ll show you everything you need to do. I might even let you try driving around the block tonight if you seem like you\u0027re paying attention to the lesson.\" The transformation in Adrian was remarkable. He went from sullen and uncomfortable to cheerful and energetic. I couldn\u0027t figure it out. Sure, I found cars and driving fascinating, but technically speaking, there was a lot more detail to learn about manual transmission than there was in Wolfe\u0027s evasive techniques. Why were those difficult for him, but the clutch was easy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck around for about an hour when we got back. To his credit, Adrian paid attention to every word I said, although his results were inconsistent whenever I quizzed him or actually let him try something. Sometimes he\u0027d respond like a pro. Other times, he\u0027d seem totally lost on things I could have sworn he\u0027d picked up. By the end of the hour, I felt safe enough with him driving the car at low speeds on empty streets. He was a long way from the highway or stop-and-go traffic of a busy city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like we\u0027ve got more lessons in our future,\" I told him when we finished. I\u0027d parked the car behind his building, and we were walking back toward the main entrance and Latte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not take that car beyond a half-mile radius. I checked the odometer. I\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noted,\" he said, still wearing that smirky smile. \"When\u0027s the next lesson? You want to come back tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going out with Brayden.\" I was surprised at how much I was looking forward to it. Not only did I want to make things up to him after the dance, but I also just wanted a dose of normality - well, at least the kind of normality Brayden and I had together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, things with Adrian were feeling really weird...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Adrian\u0027s smile fell. \"Well. I understand. I mean, love and romance and all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to the textile museum,\" I said. \"It\u0027s cool, though I\u0027m not sure how much love and romance there\u0027ll really be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian nearly came to a halt. \"There\u0027s a textile museum here? What do people do there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they look at... um, textiles. There\u0027s actually a great exhibit on - \" I stopped as we reached the front of the building. There, behind Latte, was a familiar car, the rental that Sonya and Dimitri were using. I looked questioningly at Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you expecting them tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, resuming his walk to the door. \"They\u0027ve got a key, though, so I suppose they can make themselves at home anytime. They do it a lot, actually. He eats my food, and she uses my hair stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him. \"Hopefully it\u0027s just Dimitri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter our recent revelations about the hunters, Sonya was pretty much under house arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr so I thought. When we walked into the apartment, she was sitting on the couch. No Dimitri in sight. She glanced up at us from her laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank goodness you\u0027re here,\" she said, directing her words to me. \"Jill said you two were out and I was hoping to catch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething told me no good would come out of her wanting to \"catch\" me, but I had greater concerns. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, half-expecting hunters to come through the door. \"You\u0027re supposed to be at Clarence\u0027s until you leave town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Day after tomorrow,\" she confirmed. She stood; eyes alight with whatever had driven her here. \"But I needed to talk to you now - face-to-face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would\u0027ve come to you,\" I protested. \"It\u0027s not safe for you to be out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" she said. \"I made sure I wasn\u0027t followed. This was too important.\" She was breathless and excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore important than being caught by wannabe vampire hunters? Debatable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian crossed his arms and looked surprisingly disapproving. \"Well, it\u0027s too late now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got the results back from Sydney\u0027s blood,\" explained Sonya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stopped. No, I thought. No, no, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like with Dimitri\u0027s blood, nothing physiological showed up,\" she said. \"Nothing unusual with proteins, antibodies, or anything like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief poured through me. I\u0027d been right. Nothing special about me, no inexplicable properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet... at the same time, I felt a tiny pang of regret. I wasn\u0027t the one who would fix everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sent it to a Moroi lab this time, not an Alchemist one,\" Sonya continued. \"One of the researchers - an earth user - felt a hum of earth magic. Just like how Adrian and I felt spirit in Dimitri\u0027s blood. The technician had other types of magic users examine your sample, and all four basic elements were detected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat panic returned. She had me on an emotional roller coaster, one that left me nauseous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magic... in my blood?\" A moment later, I understood. \"Of course there is,\" I said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched my cheek. \"The tattoo has vampire blood and magic in it. That\u0027s what it is. There are different degrees of charms in it from different users. That would show up in my blood.\" I shivered. Even with a logical explanation, it was a scary thing accepting that there was magic in my blood. Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s spells were still anathema to me, but at least there was some comfort in knowing they drew magic from outside of me. But knowing I had something internal? That was terrifying. And yet, I couldn\u0027t be surprised at this finding, not with the tattoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya nodded along. \"Yes, of course. But there must be something about that combination that\u0027s repulsive to Strigoi. It may be the key to all of our work!\" To my surprise, Adrian took a few steps toward me, and there was a tension in his stance that was fiercely protective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you know Alchemist blood has magic in it,\" he said. \"That\u0027s no surprise. Case closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you want from her now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another sample to start,\" said Sonya eagerly. \"There\u0027s none left in the original vial I took, once all the testing was done. I know this sounds strange, but it\u0027d also be useful if a Moroi could... well, taste your blood and see if it has the same repulsive quality as it did to Strigoi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh blood would be ideal, but even I\u0027m not deluded enough to ask you to submit to a feeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe should simply be able to use your sample and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. I stumbled backward, horrified. \"Absolutely not. Whether it\u0027s from a neck or a vial, there\u0027s no way I\u0027m giving my blood for anyone to taste. Do you know how wrong that is? I know you do it all the time with feeders, but I\u0027m not one of them. I should never have given you the first sample. You don\u0027t need me for any of this. Spirit\u0027s the key. Lee\u0027s proof that former Strigoi are the ones you need to examine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya wasn\u0027t cowed by my outburst. She pushed forward, though her tone was gentler. \"I understand your fear, but think of the applications! If something in your blood makes you resistant to Strigoi, then you could save countless lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alchemists aren\u0027t resistant,\" I said. \"That tattoo isn\u0027t protecting us, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re getting at. Do you think that in all our history, there haven\u0027t been Alchemists who were turned Strigoi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course,\" she said. Her words were hesitant, encouraging me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, the magic you sensed in me is irrelevant. It\u0027s just the tattoo. All Alchemists have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe ours tastes bad, but Alchemist blood has nothing to do with Strigoi turning. It still happens to us.\" I was rambling but didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya grew perplexed, her mind running through the implications of this news. \"But do all Alchemists have bad-tasting blood? If so, how would a Strigoi be able to drain them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it varies by person,\" I said. \"Or maybe some Strigoi are tougher than others. I don\u0027t know. Regardless, we aren\u0027t the ones to focus on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless there\u0027s just something special about you,\" mused Sonya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I didn\u0027t want that. I didn\u0027t want to be scrutinized, locked behind glass like Keith. I couldn\u0027t be. I prayed she wouldn\u0027t see how scared I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s plenty that\u0027s special about her,\" said Adrian dryly. \"But her blood\u0027s not up for dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are you pushing this again after last time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya glared at Adrian. \"I\u0027m not doing this for selfish reasons, you know that! I want to save our people. I want to save all our people. I don\u0027t want to see any new Strigoi added to the world. No one should live like that.\" A haunted look shone in her eyes, as a memory seized her. \"That kind of bloodlust and complete lack of empathy for any other living creature... no one can imagine what it\u0027s like. You\u0027re hollow. A walking nightmare, and yet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou just don\u0027t care...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny attitude,\" said Adrian, \"seeing as you purposely chose to become one.\" Sonya paled, and I felt torn. I appreciated Adrian\u0027s defense but also pitied Sonya. She\u0027d explained to me in the past about how spirit\u0027s instability - the same instability Adrian feared - had driven her to turning Strigoi. Looking back at her decision, she regretted it more than anything else in her life. She would\u0027ve submitted herself for punishment, but no court knew how to handle her situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing that was a mistake,\" she said coldly. \"One I\u0027ve learned from - which is why I\u0027m so anxious to save others from that fate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then find a way to do it without dragging Sydney into it! You know how she feels about us...\" Adrian faltered as he glanced at me, and I was surprised to almost detect bitterness in his voice. \"You know how the Alchemists feel. Keep involving her, and you\u0027ll get her in trouble with them. And if you\u0027re so convinced they\u0027ve got the answers, ask them for volunteers and do experiments that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d help with that,\" I offered. \"Getting authorized subjects for you. I\u0027d talk to my superiors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d like to see an end to Strigoi as much as you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Sonya didn\u0027t answer right away, Adrian guessed why. \"She knows they\u0027d say no, Sage. That\u0027s why she\u0027s appealing to you directly and why they didn\u0027t send your blood to an Alchemist lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t you both see how important this is?\" asked Sonya, a desperate longing to do good in her eyes. It made me feel guilty and conflicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" said Adrian. \"You think I don\u0027t want to see every single one of those bastard Strigoi wiped from the face of the earth? I do! But not at the cost of forcing people to do things they don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya gave him a long, level look. \"I think you\u0027re letting your personal feelings interfere with this. Your emotions are going to ruin our research.\" He smiled. \"Well, then. Be glad you\u0027ll be free of me in two days.\" Sonya glanced between the two of us, looked like she was about to protest, and then thought better of it. Without another word she left, her face defeated. Again, I felt torn. In theory, I knew she was right... but my gut just couldn\u0027t agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to upset her,\" I said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian\u0027s face showed no sympathy. \"She shouldn\u0027t have upset you. She knows how you feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still felt a little bad, yet I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that if I gave this, I\u0027d be asked to give more and more. I recalled the day Eddie and Dimitri had been coated in spirit magic. No way could I risk getting involved to that level. I was already pushing my limits too far. \"I know... but it\u0027s hard,\" I said. \"I like Sonya. I gave her the first vial, so I can see why she thought the second would be easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" he said. \"No is no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really will mention it to the Alchemists,\" I said. \"Maybe they\u0027ll want to help.\" I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get in too much trouble for the first vial. The Alchemists endorsed the initial experiments after all, and I\u0027d probably get points for standing up to vampire peer pressure for the other sample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"If they do, great. If not, it\u0027s not your responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thanks for gallantly coming to my defense again,\" I teased. \"Maybe you\u0027d be more into Wolfe\u0027s training if you got to protect someone else instead of yourself?\" The earlier smile returned. \"I just don\u0027t like seeing people bullied, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you should come back to Wolfe with me,\" I urged. \"You need a chance to try to get at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike that, he was serious again. He looked away. \"I don\u0027t know, Sage. We\u0027ll see. For now, we\u0027ll just focus on the driving - when you can get away from your boyfriend, of course.\" I left shortly after that, still confused about his weird behavior. Was that some of spirit\u0027s crazy effects on the mind? One minute, he was brave and defensive. The next, he was down and obstinate. Maybe there was a pattern or some type of reasoning behind it all, but it was beyond my analytical abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at Amberwood, I immediately headed for the library to get a book for my English class. Ms. Terwilliger had lightened up on my usual work so that I could \"devote more time\" to crafting her spells. Since her independent study - which was supposed to be my easy elective -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etook up more time than my other classes, it was refreshing to focus on something else for a change. As I was leaving the British Lit section, I caught sight of Jill and Eddie studying together at a table. That wasn\u0027t weird, exactly. What was weird was that Micah wasn\u0027t with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys,\" I said, slipping into a seat. \"Hard at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how weird it is to be repeating my senior year?\" asked Eddie. \"I can\u0027t even blow it off either. I have to get decent grades to stay here.\" I grinned. \"Hey, all knowledge is worth having.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the papers in front of him. \"Yeah? You got any knowledge on the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in fiction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edith Wharton,\" I said automatically. He scrawled something onto his paper, and I turned to Jill. \"How are things with you? Where\u0027s Micah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill had her chin propped in her hand and was gazing at me with the weirdest look. It was almost... dreamy. It took her a few moments to snap out of her daze and respond. The dreamy look became embarrassed and then dismayed. She glanced down at her book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I was just thinking how good you look in taupe. What did you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Micah?\" I prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Right. He\u0027s got... stuff to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretty sure that was the shortest explanation she\u0027d ever given me. I tried to remember what I\u0027d last heard on their status. \"You guys patched things up, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I guess. He understood about Thanksgiving.\" She brightened. \"Hey, Eddie and I were talking about that. Do you think we could all have a big family-style Thanksgiving at Clarence\u0027s? Do you think he\u0027d mind? We could all help, and it\u0027d be lots of fun. I mean, aside from the cover, we really are like a family. Eddie says he can make the turkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Clarence would love that,\" I said, happy to see her cheery again. Then, I replayed her words. I turned to Eddie incredulously. \"You know how to make a turkey? How would you have learned that?\" From what I knew, most dhampirs stayed nearly year-round at their schools from an early age. Not a lot of culinary time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he said, straight-faced. \"All knowledge is worth having.\" Jill laughed. \"He wouldn\u0027t tell me either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Angeline claims she can cook,\" said Eddie. \"We were talking about it at breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says she knows about cooking turkey too, so if we tag-team, we can pull it off. Of course, she\u0027ll probably want to hunt and kill her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" I said. It was amazing that he was talking about working with her on anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was even amazing that he could speak about her fondly, without a grimace. I was beginning to think more and more that her display at the assembly had been a good thing. We didn\u0027t need animosity in this group. \"Well, I got what I came for, so I\u0027m heading back. I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you,\" said Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill said nothing, and when I glanced over, I saw that she was watching me again with that weird, enraptured look. She sighed happily. \"Adrian had a great time with you at your class tonight, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly rolled my eyes. \"The bond leaves no secrets. He didn\u0027t always seem to be having a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he really did,\" she assured me. A dopey smile crossed her features. \"He loves that you love the car more than he does and thinks it\u0027s awesome you\u0027re getting so good in your defense class. Not that that\u0027s a surprise. You\u0027re always so good at everything, and you don\u0027t even realize it. You don\u0027t even realize half the things you do - like how you watch out for others and never even think about yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Eddie looked a little astonished by that. He and I exchanged puzzled looks. \"Well,\" I said awkwardly, really unsure how to handle this Sydney lovefest. I decided escape was my best option. \"Thanks. I\u0027ll see you later and - hey. Where\u0027d you get that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" she asked, blinking out of her enraptured haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill was wearing a silk scarf painted in rich jewel tones, almost reminding me of a peacock\u0027s tail. It also reminded me of something else, but I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on it. \"The scarf. I\u0027ve seen it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She ran her fingers over the smooth material. \"Lia gave it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? When did you see her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She stopped by the dorm yesterday to give the dresses back again. I didn\u0027t tell you because I knew you\u0027d want to return them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" I said adamantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill sighed. \"Come on, let\u0027s just keep them. They\u0027re so pretty. And you know she\u0027ll just bring them back anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll deal with that later. Tell me about the scarf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no big deal. She was trying to pitch me on this scarf collection - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, she told me too. How she could make it so no one recognized you.\" I shook my head, feeling a surprising amount of anger. Was nothing under my control anymore? \"I can\u0027t believe she went behind my back! Please tell me you didn\u0027t sneak off with her to do a photo shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" said Jill quickly. \"Of course not. But you don\u0027t think... I mean, you don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way she could pull it off? Hide me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep my tone gentle. After all, I was mad at Lia, not Jill. \"Maybe. Maybe not. You know we can\u0027t take the chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill nodded, face sad. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left feeling annoyed and was so distracted that I nearly ran into Trey. When he didn\u0027t respond to my greeting, I realized he was even more distracted than I was. There was a haunted look in his eyes, and he seemed exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe managed a weak smile. \"Yeah, yeah. Just feeling the pressure of everything. Nothing I can\u0027t handle. What about you? Don\u0027t they usually have to throw you out of this place? Or did you finally get tired of being here for eight hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just needed one book,\" I said. \"And I was actually only here ten minutes. I was out most of the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile fell, replaced by a frown. \"Out with Brayden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s tomorrow. I had, um, family stuff tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frown deepened. \"You go out a lot, Melbourne. You have a lot of friends outside school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that many,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not living a party lifestyle, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re getting at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well. Be careful. I\u0027ve heard about some scary stuff going on out there.\" I remembered him being concerned for Jill too. I usually kept up on all the local news and had heard nothing alarming recently. \"What, is there a crime ring in Palm Springs I should know about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just be careful,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started to part ways, and then I called to him, \"Trey? I know it\u0027s your own business, but whatever\u0027s going on... if you want to talk, I\u0027m here.\" It was a huge concession for me, seeing as I wasn\u0027t always the most socially adept person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrey gave me a wistful smile. \"Noted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was kind of reeling as I went back to my dorm. Adrian, Jill, Trey. I suppose if you counted Eddie and Angeline getting along, everyone in my life was behaving weirdly. All part of the job, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I was back in my room, I called Donna Stanton with the Alchemists. I never could be sure what time zone she was in, so I wasn\u0027t too concerned about the late hour. She answered right away and didn\u0027t sound tired, which I took as a good sign. She hadn\u0027t responded to my e-mail about the Warriors, and I was anxious for news. They posed too big a threat to us to be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Sage,\" she said. \"I was planning on calling you soon. I trust everything\u0027s okay with the Dragomir girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jill? Yeah, she\u0027s fine. I wanted to check in on some other things. You got the info I sent you about the Warriors of Light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanton sighed. \"That\u0027s what I was going to call you about. Have you had any more runins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And they don\u0027t seem to have been following us anymore either. Maybe they gave up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unlikely.\" Her next words took a long time to get out. \"Not from what we\u0027ve observed in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze, momentarily speechless. \"In the past? Do you mean... you\u0027ve run into them before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping they were just some... I don\u0027t know. A crazy, localized group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, no. We\u0027ve encountered them before. Sporadically, mind you. But they pop up everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still in disbelief. \"But I was always taught that any hunters had disappeared centuries ago. Why has no one ever talked about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly?\" asked Stanton. \"Most Alchemists don\u0027t know. We want to run an efficient organization, one that deals with the vampire problem in an organized, peaceful way. There are some people in our group who might want to take more extreme action. It\u0027s best then if the existence of our radical offshoot is kept secret. I wouldn\u0027t have even told you, but with all the contact you\u0027re having, you need to be prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Offshoot... then they are related to Alchemists!\" I was sickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for a very long time.\" She sounded equally disgusted. \"There\u0027s almost no resemblance anymore. They\u0027re reckless and savage. The only reason we let them be is because they usually just go after Strigoi. This situation with Sonya Karp is more difficult. She hasn\u0027t had any more threats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I just saw her tonight... which brings up the other reason I called...\" I gave Stanton a rundown of the various blood experiments, including my own donation. I painted it in very scientific terms, how it had seemed useful as extra data. I then made sure to sound properly appalled by the second request - which wasn\u0027t that difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not,\" said Stanton. No hesitation. Often, Alchemist decisions went through chains of command, even with someone as high up as her. It was a sign of how much this went against Alchemist beliefs that she didn\u0027t even have to consult anyone. \"Human control-blood is one thing. The rest she\u0027s suggesting is out of the question. I will not allow humans to be used in these experiments, especially when the evidence clearly shows the former Strigoi need to be the focus - not us. Besides, for all we know, this is some ploy on the Moroi part to get more of our blood for personal reasons.\" I didn\u0027t believe that last part at all and tried to find a tactful way of saying so. \"Sonya seems to sincerely believe this would help protect against Strigoi. She just doesn\u0027t seem to grasp how we feel about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she wouldn\u0027t,\" said Stanton dismissively. \"None of them do.\" She and I returned our focus to the vampire hunters. The Alchemists were doing some investigating on any sightings in the area. She didn\u0027t want me to do any active investigation myself, but I was to report in immediately if any other information came my way. She was assuming the Warriors of Light were operating nearby, and once she found out where, the Alchemists would \"deal with them.\" I wasn\u0027t entirely sure what that meant, but her tone made me shiver. As she\u0027d pointed out earlier, we weren\u0027t a particularly aggressive group... though we were excellent at getting rid of problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said, just as we were wrapping up. \"Did you ever find out anything about Marcus Finch?\" I\u0027d tried locating Clarence\u0027s mysterious human, who\u0027d helped against the hunters, but had found nothing. I\u0027d hoped Stanton might have more connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But we\u0027ll keep looking.\" A slight pause. \"Miss Sage... I can\u0027t emphasize enough how pleased we are with the work you\u0027re doing. You\u0027ve run into a few more complications than any of us expected, yet you handle them all efficiently and properly. Even your conduct with the Moroi is outstanding. A weaker person might have yielded to Karp\u0027s request. You refused and contacted me. I\u0027m so proud I took the chance on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a tightening in my chest. So proud. I couldn\u0027t remember the last time someone had said they were proud of me. Well, my mother did a lot, but no one tied to my work among the Alchemists did. For most of my life, I\u0027d hoped my father would say he was proud. I\u0027d finally given up on expecting that. Stanton was hardly a parental figure, but her words triggered happiness in me I hadn\u0027t known was waiting to come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" I said, when I could finally speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it up,\" she said. \"When I can, I\u0027ll get you out of that place and into a position that doesn\u0027t involve so much contact with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd like that, my world came crashing down. I suddenly felt guilty. She really had given me a chance, and now I was deceiving her. I was hardly like Liam, ready to sell my soul to the Strigoi, but I also wasn\u0027t staying objective with my charges. Driving lessons. Thanksgiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would Stanton say if she knew about that? I was a sham, reaping glory I didn\u0027t deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was truly a dedicated Alchemist, I\u0027d change my life here. I\u0027d stop all extraneous activities with Jill and the others. I wouldn\u0027t even attend Amberwood - I\u0027d accept the offer of outside accommodations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d only come here and see the gang when I absolutely was required to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could do those things, then I\u0027d truly be a good Alchemist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, I realized, I\u0027d also be terribly, awfully lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the only response I could give. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-17.html","bookId":2042,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM"}
