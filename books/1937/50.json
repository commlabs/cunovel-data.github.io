The ones who remained were the original members of the widows’ group—with the addition of Mark and Hector. It was hard to believe nearly a year had passed since that bleak Valentine’s evening, when they’d started their lists of Twenty Wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d completed her list last spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19.

To live happily ever after\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty wishes, nearly all of them a reality now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie had found a pair of red cowboy boots in a secondhand store for a fraction of the cost. They fit perfectly and she wore them often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen one Sunday in July, shortly after Anne Marie had begun attending church with Ellen, she’d spontaneously sung a hymn. She was well into the second verse before she remembered that she couldn’t sing anymore and yet here she was…. Now not a day went by without her belting out one song after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie’s gaze fell on Barbie, who sat next to Mark, holding his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie had met him only half a dozen times, but Barbie had spoken of him often enough to make her feel as if she knew him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we made our lists of wishes, did you ever dream it would come to this?” Elise asked, joining the circle of friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t talked about our lists recently,” Lillie said, sitting in the overstuffed chair with Hector standing behind her, his hands on her shoulders. “Has anyone completed any wishes lately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have,” Elise said, looking down at her plastic glass of champagne. “I’ve set up a charitable foundation in memory of Maverick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elise, that’s wonderful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman struggled to hide her emotion. “That’s not all. I took my two grandsons on a hot-air balloon ride. That was something Maverick and I always intended to do. We put it off—and then it was too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it as exciting as you thought it would be?” Anne Marie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise smiled warmly. “Even better than I imagined. When I closed my eyes, I could almost feel Maverick’s arms around me again,” she said in a low voice. “It was the most thrilling sensation to be that high above the ground. He would’ve loved it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I completed one of my wishes, too,” Barbie volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one?” Lillie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes dancing, she glanced at Mark. “I went skinny-dipping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillie frowned. “I have a feeling you weren’t alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbie giggled like a schoolgirl. “As it happens, I wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark shifted uncomfortably in his wheelchair. “I believe that falls under the heading of too much information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You went with Mark.” Lillie feigned shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbie laughed and leaned over to kiss his cheek. “I’m not telling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark couldn’t quite restrain a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you, Anne Marie?” Barbie asked, diverting attention away from her and Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m about to accomplish one of my most heartfelt wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About to?” Hector asked. “I thought the adoption was finalized this afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was, and Ellen’s now my daughter in the eyes of the law. But this is another wish.” She opened her purse and removed a thick envelope and showed it to the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen dashed over to her side. “Can I tell everyone?” she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead,” Anne Marie told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom,” she said, and looked at Anne Marie. “Is it okay to call you Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom bought tickets for us to fly to Paris for our first Christmas together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paris,” Elise repeated slowly. “What a perfect idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie slipped her arm around Ellen. “I’m going to Paris with someone I love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbie’s eyes were soft. “That’s just beautiful.” She glanced at Mark, who grumbled something about not getting any ideas. She ignored him and reached for the brochure Anne Marie handed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Barbie, I’m warning you right now, I’m not going to Paris.” Mark hesitated. “Go if you like. I’ll even encourage it. But I’m staying right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean it, Barbie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you do.” Apparently she had no intention of arguing with him. “I’m perfectly capable of traveling to Europe for two weeks on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two weeks?” Mark said, frowning. “That long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would hardly be worth my while to travel all that way for less than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark groaned. “Why do I have the feeling that I’m going to be staring up at the Eiffel Tower and wondering how I got there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen walked over to where Anne Marie was sitting and climbed onto her lap. “One of my wishes came true, too,” she told the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one was that?” Hector asked kindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I found a mom,” Ellen announced. “I thought Anne Marie would just be my Lunch Buddy but now she’s my mom. Forever and ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forever and ever,” Anne Marie repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a solemn moment, broken only by Ellen’s happy shout. “Hey, Mom! You have to start a new list of Twenty Wishes now, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie smiled. This truly wasn’t the end but a new beginning for them all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5/page-50.html","bookId":1937,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM"}
