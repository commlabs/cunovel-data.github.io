In six months you have accomplished as much as I did at boarding school in two years, when at your age.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you really mean it, Mr. Spencer?” said Tony, gratified.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am quite in earnest.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am very glad of it,” said Tony. “When I began I was almost discouraged. I was so much behind boys of my age.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And now your attainments raise you above the average. Your tutor told me so yesterday, when I made inquiries.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am rejoiced to hear it, Mr. Spencer. I was very much ashamed of myself at first, and did not like to speak before your friends for fear they would find out what sort of a life I had led. That is what made me work so hard.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Tony, you may congratulate yourself on having succeeded. I think you can venture now to take a little vacation.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A vacation! I don’t need one.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Suppose it were spent in Europe?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What!” exclaimed Tony, eagerly, “you don’t think of our going abroad?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes. The house with which I am connected wants me to go abroad on business. If I go you may go with me if you would like it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Like it!” exclaimed Tony, impetuously. “There is nothing I would like better.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So I supposed,” said George Spencer, smiling. “I may as well tell you that our passage is taken for next Wednesday, by the Coronia.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And this is Friday evening. How soon it seems!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There won’t be much preparation to make—merely packing your trunk.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mr. Spencer,” said Tony, “I want to ask a favor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have told you about being employed at a country hotel, just before I came to the city and found you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I would like to go back there for a day, just to see how all my old friends are.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You don’t mean to apply again for your old place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not unless you turn me off, and I have to find work somewhere.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Turn you off, Tony! Why, I shouldn’t know how to get along without you. You are like a younger brother to me,” said the young man, earnestly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thank you, Mr. Spencer. You seem like an older brother to me. Sometimes I can hardly believe that I was once a tramp.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It was your misfortune, Tony, not your fault. So you want to go back and view your former home?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, Mr. Spencer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then you had better start to-morrow morning, so as to be back in good time to prepare for the journey.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you know, Mr. Spencer,” said Tony, “I’ve got an idea. I’ll go back wearing the same clothes I had on when I left there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you got them still?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, I laid them away, just to remind me of my old life. I’ll take my other clothes and after a while I can put them on.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is your idea in doing this, Tony?” asked the young man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I want to give them a surprise.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Very well, do as you please. Only don’t stay away too long.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony proceeded to carry out the plan he had proposed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He traveled by rail to a village near by, and then with his bundle suspended to a stick, took up his march to the tavern.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He entered the familiar stable yard. All looked as it did the day he left. There was only one person in the yard, and that one Tony recognized at once as his old enemy, Sam Payson, who appeared to be filling his old position, as stableboy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hello, Sam!” said Tony, whose entrance had not been observed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sam looked up and whistled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What! have you come back?” he said, not appearing overjoyed at the sight of Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, Sam,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where have you been all the time?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In New York part of the time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What have you been doing for a living?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I lived with a gentleman there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did you do—black his boots?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not exactly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did he turn you off?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No; but he’s going to Europe next Wednesday.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So you’re out of a place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have no employment.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What made you come back here?” demanded Sam, suspiciously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I thought I’d like to see you all again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That don’t go down,” said Sam, roughly. “I know well enough what you’re after.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What am I after?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re after my place. You’re hoping Mr. Porter will take you on again. But it’s no use. There ain’t any chance for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How long have you been back again, Sam?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Three months, and I am goin’ to stay, too. You got me turned off once, but you can’t do it again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t want to.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, no, I presume not,” sneered Sam. “Of course, you don’t. You’ve got on the same clothes you wore away, haven’t you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, it’s the same suit, but I’ve got some more things in my bundle.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess you haven’t made your fortune, by the looks.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The fact is, Sam, I haven’t earned much since I went away.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I knew you wouldn’t. You ain’t so smart as people think.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn’t know anybody thought me smart.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “James, the hostler, is always talking you up to me, but I guess I can rub along as well as you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You talk as if I was your enemy, Sam, instead of your friend.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t want such a friend. You’re after my place, in spite of all you say.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then James, the hostler, came out of the stable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What! is it you, Tony?” he asked, cordially.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, James; I hope you’re well.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Tiptop; and how are you?” asked the hostler, examining Tony, critically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m well.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you been doing well?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I haven’t wanted for anything. I’ve been with a gentleman in New York.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here Mr. Porter appeared on the scene.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He, too, recognized Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What! back again, Tony?” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I thought I’d just look in, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you want a place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What sort of a place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your old place.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sam heard this, and looked the picture of dismay. He took it for granted that Tony would accept at once, and privately determined that if he did he would give him a flogging, if it were a possible thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was both relieved and surprised when Tony answered:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am much obliged to you, Mr. Porter, but I wouldn’t like to cut out Sam. Besides, I have a place engaged in New York.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I would rather have you than Sam, any day.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank you, sir, but I’ve made an engagement, and can’t break it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How long are you going to stay here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If you’ve a spare room, I’ll stay over till to-morrow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All right. Go into the office, and they’ll give you one.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I say, Tony,” said Sam, after the landlord had gone, “you’re a better fellow than I thought you were. I thought you’d take my place when it was offered you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You see you were mistaken, Sam. I’ll see you again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony went into the hotel—went up to a small chamber that had been assigned him, changed his clothes for a handsome suit in his bundle, took a handsome gold watch and chain from his pocket and displayed them on his vest, and then came down again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he entered the yard again, Sam stared in amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It can’t be you, Tony!” he said. “Where’d you get them clothes? and that watch?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I came by them honestly, Sam.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But I can’t understand it,” said Sam, scratching his head. “Ain’t you poor, and out of work?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m out of work, but not poor. I’ve been adopted by a rich gentleman, and am going to sail for Europe on Wednesday.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Cracky! who ever heard the like? Wouldn’t he adopt me, too?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I believe there is no vacancy,” said Tony, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was that the reason you wouldn’t take my place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “One reason.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “James!” called Sam, “just look at Tony, now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James stared, and when explanation was made, heartily congratulated our hero.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sam,” said Tony, producing a couple of showy neckties, “to prove to you that I am not your enemy, I have brought you these.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They’re stunning!” exclaimed the enraptured Sam. “I always thought you was a good fellow, Tony. Are they really for me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To be sure they are, but I’m afraid, Sam, you didn’t always think quite so well of me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I do now. You’re a trump.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And, James, I’ve brought you a present, too.” Here Tony produced a handsome silver watch with a silver chain appended. “It’s to remember me by.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’d remember you without it, Tony, but I’m very much obliged to you. It’s a real beauty.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the landlord was told of Tony’s good fortune, he was as much surprised as the rest. Our hero was at once changed to the handsomest room in the hotel, and was made quite a lion during the remainder of his stay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is something in success after all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good-by, Tony,” said Sam, heartily, when our hero left the next day. “You’re a gentleman, and I always said so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank you, Sam. Good luck to you!” responded Tony, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’m a much finer fellow than when I was a tramp,” he said to himself. “Sam says so, and he ought to know. I suppose it’s the way of the world. And now for Europe!”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2019/57616.html","bookId":622,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:05 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:05 AM"}
