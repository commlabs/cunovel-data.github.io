I bit my bottom lip as Connor put the Ranger in park. He put his hand on top of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be nervous, my family will love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and took Connors arm as we walked up the steps to the grand house. He opened the front door and we stepped inside. The smell of turkey and stuffing filled the elegantly decorated home. There was laughter coming from the other room as a brown-haired boy peeked around the corner of the wall. He took one look at Connor and ran to him jumping in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey buddy, how are you?” Connor smiled. The boy hugged him tight. “Camden, this is my special friend Ellery.” Camden looked at me with his blue eyes and just stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi Camden,” I smiled and held out my hand. He continued to stare, unsure of me, and then looked back at Connor. He put both hands on Connors cheeks and smiled. My heart melted at that moment, it was obvious this boy loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s ok Camden, you can touch Ellery.” He looked back at me and slowly put his hand in mine as I gently shook it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Connor darling,” a woman emerged from the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother, this is Ellery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me and took my hands, “You are just as beautiful as Connor said you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed, “Thank you, it’s nice to meet you Mrs. Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call me Jenny dear,” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was a beautiful woman who Connor resembled a great deal. She was tall and thin and with her light brown bob style hair and green eyes, she didn’t look her age, she looked much younger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamden was struggling to be put down as Connor and I walked towards the living room. Everyone in the room stopped talking and turned to stare at us as we walked in. Connor put down Camden as he ran over to a young woman. I felt like I was on display the way everyone was staring at me. The young woman jumped up and gave Connor a big hug, “Happy Thanksgiving brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and kissed her on the cheek, “Cassidy, this is Ellery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and hugged me, “I’m so happy to finally meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and hugged her back. Her smile was big and her green eyes were full of light. She was exactly my height and she wore her black hair short and stylish. Connor took me around the room and introduced me to the rest of his family and friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassidy took my hand, “Come on let’s see if mom needs help in the kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Connor and he nodded for me to go with a big smile on his face that made me miss him already. It surprised me to find Mrs. Black in the kitchen cooking Thanksgiving dinner; usually the rich have their own personal chefs to do that for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So Ellery, Connor says you’re an artist,” Jenny said as she basted the turkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I paint pictures for a small art gallery in New York.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassidy smiled, “I bought one, but I didn’t know my brother was dating the artist. You paint beautiful pictures Ellery; you are very talented.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was starting to feel more relaxed as she handed me a glass of red wine. As Jenny pushed the turkey back in the oven, she turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Connor hasn’t really told us anything about you, why don’t you fill us in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic started to set in; how could I tell these people, whom I just met less than 30 minutes ago, about my past and present life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to excuse my mother,” Cassidy said. “It’s just you’re the first girl Connor has ever brought home and we just want to get to know the woman who finally managed to steal his heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I took a sip of wine. Just as I was about to say something, an older woman walked into the kitchen. She was in her late 60’s with black hair and grey streaks running through it. Cassidy ran to her and hugged her tight, “Aunt Sadie, you made it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I did, I couldn’t wait to see my favorite niece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m your only niece Aunt Sadie,” Cassidy frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that’s why you’re my favorite,” Sadie smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to me, “Now who might this young pretty woman be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her name is Ellery and she’s Connors girlfriend,” Jenny spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and gently hugged me, “Nice to meet you dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away and looked at me with serious eyes, like she was looking into my soul. “You’re sick,” she said. My eyes widened and fear started running through my body. What did she mean by that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked at her sister, “Sadie, that’s rude.” Sadie looked at me and grabbed my hands, turning my wrists over and staring at my tattoos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forgive my sister Ellery, she has a bit of a gift and sometimes she can be very bold with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sick Ellery, like do you have a cold or something?” Cassidy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s more than a cold,” Sadie answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh god, here we go and thank you Connor for not telling your family ahead of time and for not telling me that Aunt Sadie has a gift. I took another sip of my wine and looked at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have cancer,” I blurted out. Just like that, no hesitation nothing, I just let the words fall out. They stood there and stared at me, I couldn’t have been placed in the most awkward position even if I tried. Sadie finally spoke up to break the tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t your first bout with it, is it?” Holy mother of pearl, I bet she’s going to bring up my suicide attempt; great first impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heavily sighed, “No it isn’t. I was first diagnosed with cancer when I was sixteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point Connor decided to make an appearance. He heard what I said as he came from behind and wrapped his arms around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It came back recently, but she’s in a trial study program in California so everything is good at the moment. She’s doing fine and she’s going to be fine, so there’s nothing more to discuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone was commanding and everyone knew it. I smiled as I pulled him out of the kitchen and into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could you not tell me about Aunt Sadie?” I asked furiously as I hit him in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch Elle, that hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not the only thing that’s going to hurt Connor Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smug smirk blew across his face as he looked at me, “Promise baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh you make me so mad,” I whispered as I turned the opposite way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his arms around me and whispered, “I’m sorry, I never took much stock in what Aunt Sadie had to say, I always thought she was kind of crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your family must think I’m a walking disaster of a human being and probably wondering what the hell you’re doing with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed me tight, “They love you, I can tell and it doesn’t matter what they think about our relationship, I love you for all that you are, nothing less, and for the record, I think you’re a beautiful disaster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid my head back on his chest and looked up as he leaned down to kiss me. I bit his lip for that beautiful disaster comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch, you really need to save this shit for the bedroom Ellery; you have no idea how much you’re turning me on with all your hitting and biting.” I couldn’t help to laugh and turn around to gently lick his bitten lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner was exceptional and the rest of the day went smooth. Cassidy and I talked about our jobs while Connor sat on the floor and played with Camden. We both stared at them as Camden was teaching Connor how to stack the blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have never seen my brother as happy as he is right now,” she said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and looked over at him, “He’s a very special man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Jenny interrupted, “Ellery how did you and my son meet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile spread across my face as Connor looked at me with fear in his eyes. I decided to spare him the embarrassment and replied, “We met at a club.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, “Well, lucky for him you were there.” I smiled back and looked at the relief that washed over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was leaning over the bathroom sink washing my face as Connor was getting undressed. “I loved watching you with Camden today; it was so special and sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well he’s a pretty special kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded the wash cloth and put it on the sink. “It made me think of some things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked out of the bathroom and I opened the drawer to take out my nightshirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What things?” he asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know; just how good you are with him and…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly he cut me off, “I can’t have children Elle; I took care of that years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy back was turned to him and his words shredded their way through my body. I took in a deep breath and continued to undress and get into my night-shirt. The air that surrounded us changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you going to respond to that?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around, “Ok, why didn’t you tell me that before?” I was feeling a little betrayed that he wouldn’t have told me that sooner in our relationship. Maybe he thought it wasn’t necessary to because I was going to die anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know it just didn’t seem to ever be appropriate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it came, the words only my mouth would say, “Was it because you thought I was going to die and it didn’t matter if I never knew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on his face broke and anguish washed over him, “How could you say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to face the window, “I’m sorry I didn’t mean it, and anyway, I don’t want kids; with my f**ked up family genes the kid wouldn’t stand a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to me and put his arms around me and pulled me into him. “Don’t say things like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the truth. My mother dying of cancer, father an alcoholic, me having cancer twice; think about it Connor, the child would be doomed the minute it was conceived.” It killed me to say those words, but it was the truth and I was being honest with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wrong and I don’t want you talking like that ever again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loosened myself from his grip, “Well, it doesn’t matter anyway because neither of us wants kids, so end of discussion.” I walked across the room over to the dresser and grabbed the lotion bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does it bother you that I can’t have children?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, like I said, it’s for the best anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lying, it did bother me, and it bothered me that he didn’t tell me. I braced myself as I asked the next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you do it Conner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took in a sharp breath, “Do you really want to hear the answer to that Elle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t, but I did. I needed to hear him say it. “Yes I do, since we’re being honest and not keeping secrets, tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed hard and didn’t say anything; I don’t think the words would come out of his mouth, but my mouth had no problems at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you can’t say anything, let me say it for you. You were never going to fall in love and that meant never having kids, so why torture yourself with only experiencing half pleasure every time you f**ked a woman when you could experience the whole natural pleasure and not have a worry in the world, except being ignorant about STD’s.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-30.html","bookId":1821,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:11 PM"}
