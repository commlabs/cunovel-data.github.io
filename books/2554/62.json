At least he assumed it was warm. He\u0027d lost all feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, you\u0027re all but frozen. I hope you don\u0027t mind, but I\u0027m going to have to cut you out of those wet clothes. There\u0027s not much left to them anyway. Mostly charred rags.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the next few minutes he felt himself rolled left and right as he assumed his tattered clothing was being ripped or cut away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you worry about me staring at your bum or your privates. I got what they call wet AMD - macular degeneration. You\u0027re mostly a blur to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t worried about that. Survival was his concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left him, then returned. He felt a blanket fall over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re gonna have to stay there on the rug for now, I\u0027m afraid. No way we\u0027re gonna get you up on the couch. But this here\u0027s an electric blanket. It\u0027ll warm up shortly and start raising your temperature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Warmth. He\u0027d thought he\u0027d never be warm again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you? I heard an explosion and saw something light up out on the water. That you? Your boat blow up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly what had happened, but he could not imagine how. He\u0027d been free. The burning house had been a glow fading in his wake when something shot out of the darkness and struck the rear of the boat, hurling him through the air and into the water. He remembered nothing until he washed up on this shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, whatever happened, you need a doctor and a hospital, especially for that hand. From what I can see it\u0027s all charred, and I guess that\u0027s good because it\u0027s not bleeding, but that stump\u0027s gonna need specialist care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! He was too weak. He\u0027d be vulnerable in a hospital. Defenseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no way you\u0027re gonna get to one tonight. The phone\u0027s not working worth a damn, and even if it was, I don\u0027t see anyone coming out in this storm. So we\u0027re gonna have to ride it out together tonight and see what the morning brings. I\u0027ll get the boat out here as soon as it can make the trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not allow her to call for help, but how could he stop her? He fought to stay conscious, but it slipped away ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... until he felt himself rolled onto his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" she was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head was propped on pillows or cushions. He knew only that they were soft. He felt a straw pressed between his swollen lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink some of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew on the straw. Hot salty liquid filled his mouth. He swallowed and greedily sucked more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heated you up a can of chicken broth. Drink as much as you can. With the electric blanket cooking you on the outside and this working from the inside, we\u0027ll have you warmed up yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cow ... if he survived this, she would be rewarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed more and took a breath. He tried his voice. He had to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where...?\" was all he could manage. His voice sounded like sandpaper on concrete. He must have inhaled smoke, perhaps even a little flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so you can speak. Well, your voice don\u0027t sound too good. Maybe you better save it. As for where you are - little place called Sadie\u0027s Island, in the middle of Gardiner\u0027s Bay. And me? I\u0027m Sadie. Sadie Swick. I own this little hunk of rock and I\u0027m its sole resident. And how about you? What are you called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat name to use? He\u0027d had so many of them. He chose an old one at random.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roma,\" he croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the quarterback? Any relation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many people had asked him those questions when he\u0027d started using the name. He had no idea what they were talking about at first, but he\u0027d soon learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rome-AH,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the city then. Got a first name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A real Italian, ay? You don\u0027t look Italian, but then I\u0027ve known a bunch of Italians who don\u0027t. Welcome to Sadie\u0027s Island, Sal. Wish it could have been under better circumstances but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe talked on but her voice faded with his consciousness. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-62.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
