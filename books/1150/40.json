{"id":16623,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX RISE OF A NEW SCHOOL","content":"In poetry the external form, or framework, or setting of the poetic thought—the word-building in which the thought is enshrined—has varied vastly from age to age and from nation to nation. There is the system of the Greeks and Romans, according to which every syllable of every word is, as it were, hall-marked with its own \"quantity,\" counted, that is, (often almost independently of the pronunciation) to be in itself either short or long, and their verse was made by special collocations of these short or long syllables—a form highly artistic and beautiful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then there is the principle of the Anglo-Saxon, Icelandic, and Teutonic peoples, which prevailed in England even down to the time of Chaucer, in which verse is marked only by accent and staff-rhyme, in other words is alliterative as in the \"Book of Piers Ploughman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lastly, there is the rhymed poetry of the later Middle Ages, of which outside of Wales and Ireland there probably exists no example in a European vernacular language older than the ninth century. This system, apparently invented by the Celts, assumed in Ireland a most extraordinary and artificial form of its own, the essence of which was that they divided the consonants[Pg 540] into groups,[1] and any consonant belonging to a particular group was allowed to rhyme with any other consonant belonging to the same. Thus a word ending in t could rhyme with a word ending in p or c, but with no other; a word ending in b could rhyme with one ending in g or dy but with no other, and so on. Thus \"rap\" would have been considered by the Irish to make perfect rhyme with \"sat\" or \"mac\" but not with \"rag\"; and \"rag\" to make perfect rhyme with \"slab\" or \"mad,\" but not with \"cap,\" \"sat\" or \"mac.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This classification of the consonants which was taught in the Irish schools for very many hundred years, and which forms the basis of the classical poetry which we spoke of in the last chapter, is to a considerable extent—I do not quite know how far—founded upon really sound phonological principles,[2] and the ear of the Irishman was so finely attuned to it that no mistake was ever made, for while such rhymes as \"Flann\" and \"ram\" fell agreeably on his ear, any Irish poet for a thousand years would have shuddered to hear \"Flann\" rhymed with \"raff.\" This accurate ear for the classification of consonants is now almost a lost sense, but even still traces of it may be found in the barbarous English rhymes of the Irish peasantry, as in such rude verses as this from the County Cavan—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By loving of a maiD,\n\u003cbr\u003e One Catherine Mac CaBe,\n\u003cbr\u003e My life it was betrayeD,\n\u003cbr\u003e She\u0027s a dear maid on me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 541]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or this—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I courted lovely Mary at the age of sixteeN\n\u003cbr\u003e Slender was her waist and her carriage genteeL.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or this from the County Dublin—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When you were an acorn on the tree toP\n\u003cbr\u003e Then was I an aigle[3] coCK,\n\u003cbr\u003e Now that you are a withered ould bloCK\n\u003cbr\u003e Still am I an aigle cock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or this from the County Cork—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sir Henry kissed behind the bush\n\u003cbr\u003e Sir Henry kissed the QuaKer;\n\u003cbr\u003e Well and what if he did\n\u003cbr\u003e Sure he didn\u0027t aTe her!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upon the whole, however, that keen perception for the nuances of sound, and that fine ear which insisted upon a liquid rhyming only with a fellow liquid, and so on of the other classes, may be considered as almost wholly lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We now come to the great breaking up and total disruption of the Irish prosody as employed for a thousand years by thousands of poets in the bardic schools and colleges. The principles of this great change may be summed up in two sentences; first, the adoption of vowel rhyme in place of consonantal rhyme; second, the adoption of a certain number of accents in each line in place of a certain number of syllables. These were two of the most far-reaching changes that could overtake the poetry of any country, and they completely metamorphosed that of Ireland.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was only on the destruction of the great Milesian and Norman families in the seventeenth century, that the rules of poetry, so long and so carefully guarded in the bardic schools, ceased to be taught; and it was the break up of these schools which rendered the success of the new principles[Pg 542] possible. A brilliant success they had. Almost in the twinkling of an eye Irish poetry completely changed its form and complexion, and from being, as it were, so bound up and swathed around with rules that none who had not spent years over its technicalities could move about in it with vigour, its spirit suddenly burst forth in all the freedom of the elements, and clothed itself, so to speak, in the colours of the rainbow. Now indeed for the first time poetry became the handmaid of the many, not the mistress of the few; and through every nook and corner of the island the populace, neglecting all bardic training, burst forth into the most passionate song. Now, too, the remnant of the bards—the great houses being fallen—turned instinctively to the general public, and threw behind them the intricate metres of the schools, and dropped too, at a stroke, several thousand words, which no one except the great chiefs and those trained by the poets understood, whilst they broke out into beautiful, and at the same time intelligible verse, which no Gael of Ireland and Scotland who has ever heard or learned it is likely ever to forget. This is to my mind perhaps the sweetest creation of all Irish literature, the real glory of the modern Irish nation, and of the Scottish Highlands, this is the truest note of the enchanting Celtic siren, and he who has once heard it and remains deaf to its charm can have little heart for song or soul for music. The Gaelic poetry of the last two centuries both in Ireland and in the Highlands is probably the most sensuous attempt to convey music in words, ever made by man. It is absolutely impossible to convey the lusciousness of sound, richness of rhythm, and perfection of harmony, in another language. Scores upon scores of new and brilliant metres made their appearance, and the common Irish of the four provinces deprived of almost everything else, clung all the closer to the Muse. Of it indeed they might have said in the words of Moore—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Through grief and through danger thy smile has cheered my way\n\u003cbr\u003e Till hope seemed to bud from each thorn that round about me lay.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 543]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is impossible to convey any idea of this new outburst of Irish melody in another language. Suffice it to say that the principle of it was a wonderful arrangement of vowel sounds, so placed that in every accented syllable, first one vowel and then another fell upon the ear in all possible kinds of harmonious modifications. Some verses are made wholly on the á sound, others on the ó, ú, é, í sounds, but the majority on a wonderful and fascinating intermixture of two, three, or more. The consonants which played so very prominent a part under the old bardic system were utterly neglected now, and vowel sounds alone were sought for.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Scottish Gaels, if I am not mistaken, led the way in this great change, which metamorphosed the poetry of an entire people in both islands. The bardic system, outside of the kingdom of the Lord of the Isles, had apparently scarcely taken the same hold upon the nobles, in Scotland as in Ireland, and the first modern Scotch Gaelic poet to start upon the new system seems to have been Mary, daughter of Alaster Rua MacLeod, who was born in Harris in 1569, and who appears to have possessed no higher social standing than that of a kind of lady nurse in the chief\u0027s family. If the nine poems in free vowel metres, which are attributed to her by Mackenzie in his great collection,[4] be genuine, then I should consider her as the[Pg 544] pioneer of the new school. Certainly no Irishman nor Irishwoman of the sixteenth century has left anything like Mary\u0027s metres behind them, and indeed I have not met more than one or two of them used in Ireland during that century.[5] No one, for instance, would have dreamt of vowel-rhyming thus, as she does over the drowning of Mac\u0027Illachallun:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My grief my pain,\n\u003cbr\u003e Relief was vain\n\u003cbr\u003e The seething wave\n\u003cbr\u003e Did leap and rave,\n\u003cbr\u003e And reeve in twain,\n\u003cbr\u003e Both sheet and sail,\n\u003cbr\u003e And leave us bare\n\u003cbr\u003e And FOUNDERING.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas, indeed,\n\u003cbr\u003e For her you leave\n\u003cbr\u003e Your brothers grief\n\u003cbr\u003e To them will cleave.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was on Easter\n\u003cbr\u003e Monday\u0027s feast\n\u003cbr\u003e The branch of peace\n\u003cbr\u003e Went DOWN WITH YOU.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The earliest intimations of the new school in Ireland which I have been able to come across, occur towards the very close of the sixteenth century, one being a war ode on a victory of the O\u0027Byrnes,[6] and the other being an abhran or[Pg 545] song addressed by a bard unknown to me, one John Mac Céibhfinn to O\u0027Conor Sligo, apparently on his being blockaded by Red Hugh in the country of the Clan Donogh in 1599.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for the classical metres of the schools they were already completely lost by the middle of the eighteenth century, and the last specimen which I have found composed in Connacht is one by Father Patrick O\u0027Curneen,[7] to the house of the O\u0027Conors, of Belanagare, in 1734, which is in perfect Deibhidh metre.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She who Rules the Race is one\n\u003cbr\u003e SPrung from the sparring Ternon,\n\u003cbr\u003e MARY MILD of MIEN O\u0027Rorke,\n\u003cbr\u003e Our FAIRY CHILD QUEEN bulwark.[8]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 546]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let me Pray the puissant one\n\u003cbr\u003e To Mark them in their Mansion,\n\u003cbr\u003e Guard from FEAR their FAME and wed\n\u003cbr\u003e Each YEAR their NAME and homestead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In Munster I find the poet Andrew Mac Curtin some time between the year 1718 and 1743,[9] complaining to James Mac Donnell, of Kilkee, that he had to frame \"a left-handed awkward ditty of a thing,\" meaning a poem of the new school; \"but I have had to do it,\" he says, \"to fit myself in with the evil fashion that was never practised in Erin before, since it is a thing that I see, that greater is the respect and honour every dry scant-educated boor, or every clumsy baogaire of little learning, who has no clear view of either alliteration or poetry,[10] gets from the noblemen of the country, than the courteous very-educated shanachy or man of song, if he compose a well-made lay or poem.\" Nevertheless, he insists that he will make a true poem, \"although wealthy men of herds, or people of riches think that I am a fool if I compose a lay or poem in good taste, that is not my belief. Although rich men of herds, merchants, or people who put out money to grow, think that great is the blindness and want of sense to[Pg 547] compose a duan or a poem, they being well satisfied if only they can speak the Saxon dialect, and are able to have stock of bullocks or sheep, and to put redness [i.e., of cultivation] on hills—nevertheless, it is by me understood that they are very greatly deceived, because their herds and their heavy riches shall go by like a summer fog, but the scientific work shall be there to be seen for ever,\" etc. The poem which he composed on that occasion was, perhaps, the last in Deibhidh metre composed in the province of Munster.[11]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In Scotland the Deibhidh was not forgotten until after Sheriffmuir, in 1715. There is an admirable elegy of 220 lines in the Book of Clanranald on Allan of Clanranald, who was there slain.[12] It is in no way distinguishable from an Irish poem of the same period. There are other poems in this book in perfect classical metres, for in the kingdom of the Lord of the Isles the bards and their schools may be said to have almost found a last asylum. Indeed, up to this period, so far as I can see,—whatever may have been the case with the spoken language—the written language of the two countries was absolutely identical, and Irish bards and harpers found a second home in North Scotland and the Isles, where such poems as those of Gerald, fourth Earl of Desmond, appear to have been as popular as they were in Munster. We may, then, place the generation that lived between Sheriffmuir and Culloden as that which witnessed the end of the classical metres in both countries, over all Ireland and Gaelic-speaking Scotland, from Sutherland in the North, to the County Kerry in the South, so that, from that day to this, vowel-rhyming accented metres which had been making their way in both[Pg 548] countries from a little before the year 1600, have reigned without any rival.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wonderful metres these were. Here is an example of one made on the vowels é [?] and ó, but while the arrangement in the first half of the verse is o/é, é/o, é/o, o; the arrangement in the second half is o é, o é, o é, é. I have translated it in such a way as to mark the vowel rhymes, and this will show better than anything else the plan of Irish poetry during the last 250 years. To understand the scheme thoroughly the vowels must not be slurred over, but be dwelt upon and accentuated as they are in Irish.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The pOets with lAys are uprAising their nOtes\n\u003cbr\u003e In amAze, and they knOw how their tOnes will delight,\n\u003cbr\u003e For the gOlden-hair lAdy so grAceful, so pOseful,\n\u003cbr\u003e So gAElic, so glOrious enthrOned in our sight\n\u003cbr\u003e UnfOlding a tAle, how the sOul of a fAy must\n\u003cbr\u003e Be clOthed in the frAme of a lAdy so bright,\n\u003cbr\u003e UntOld are her grAces, a rOse in her fAce is\n\u003cbr\u003e And nO man so stAid is but fAints at her sight.\"[13]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here is another verse of a different character, in which three words follow each other in each line, all making a different vowel-rhyme.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"O swan brightly GLEAMING o\u0027er ponds whitely BEAMING,\n\u003cbr\u003e Swim on lightly CLEAVING and flashing through sea,\n\u003cbr\u003e The wan night is LEAVING my fond sprite in GRIEVING\n\u003cbr\u003e Beyond sight, or SEEING thou\u0027rt passing from me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 549]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here is another typical verse of a metre in which many poems were made to the air of Moreen ni [nee] Cullenáin.

The Scotch Gaels, like the Irish, produced about the same time a wonderful outburst of lyric poetry worthy to take a place in the national literature beside the spirited ballads of the Lowlands. Unlike the Lowlands, however, neither they nor the Irish can be said to have at all succeeded with the ballad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To a fAR mountain hARbour\n\u003cbr\u003e Prince ChARlie came flYing,\n\u003cbr\u003e The wInds from the HIghlands\n\u003cbr\u003e Wailed wIld in the air,\n\u003cbr\u003e On his breast was no stAR,\n\u003cbr\u003e And no guARd was besIde him,\n\u003cbr\u003e But a girl by him glIding\n\u003cbr\u003e Who guIded him there.\n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 550]\n\u003cbr\u003e Like a rAy went the mAiden\n\u003cbr\u003e Still fAithful, but mOurning,\n\u003cbr\u003e For ChARlie was pARting\n\u003cbr\u003e From heARts that adOred him,\n\u003cbr\u003e And sIghing besIde him\n\u003cbr\u003e She spIed over Ocean\n\u003cbr\u003e The Oarsmen befOre them\n\u003cbr\u003e ApprOaching their lair.\"[15]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These beautiful and recondite measures were meant apparently to imitate music, and many of them are wedded to well-known airs. They did not all come into vogue at the same time, but reached their highest pitch of perfection and melody—melody at times exaggerated, too luscious, almost cloying—about the middle of the eighteenth century, at a time when the Irish, deprived by the Penal laws of all possibility of bettering their condition or of educating themselves, could do nothing but sing, which they did in every county of Ireland, with all the sweetness of the dying swan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Geoffrey Keating, the historian, himself said to have been a casual habitué of the schools of the bards, and a close friend of many of the bardic professors, was nevertheless one[Pg 551] of the first to wring himself free from the fetters of the classical metres, and to adopt an accented instead of a syllabic standard of verse. We must now go back and give some account of this remarkable man, and of some of his contemporaries of the seventeenth century.\n\u003cbr\u003e ********\n\u003cbr\u003e [1] Their classification was as follows:—\n\u003cbr\u003e S stood by itself because of the peculiar phonetic laws which it obeys.\n\u003cbr\u003e P.C.T. called soft consonants [really hard not soft].\n\u003cbr\u003e B.G.D. called hard consonants [these are in fact rather soft than hard],\n\u003cbr\u003e F.

That he did not do so, and that none of the straight-verse or classical poets attempted it, long after they had become acquainted with the other system, seems to me a strong proof that they did not intend it, and that they really possessed no system of \"metrical accent\" at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is noticeable that O\u0027Curneen wrote this poem in the difficult bardic dialect, so that Charles O\u0027Conor of Belanagare, whose native language was Irish, was obliged in his copy to gloss over twenty words of it with more familiar ones of his own. These uncommon bardic terms were wholly thrown aside by the new school.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [9] His poem with its prose Irish preface is addressed to Sorley Mac Donnell, and Isabel, his wife, who was an O\u0027Brien.

He wrote this poem in his youth, before his muse gave itself up, as it did in later days, to wholly religious subjects. In the original the rhymes are on é and ú.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Taid éigse \u0027gus úghdair go trúpach ag pléireacht\n\u003cbr\u003e So súgach, go sgléipeach \u0027s a ndréachta dá snígheam\n\u003cbr\u003e Ar Spéir-bhruinnioll mhúinte do phlúr-sgoth na h-éireann\n\u003cbr\u003e Do úr-chriostal gAOlach a\u0027s réiltion na righeacht;\n\u003cbr\u003e Ta fiúnn-lil ag pléireacht mar dhúbha ar an éclips,\n\u003cbr\u003e Go clúdaighthe ag Phoébus, le AOn-ghile gnaoi,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Sgur\u0027na gnúis mhilis léightear do thúirling Cupid caémh-ghlic\n\u003cbr\u003e Ag múchadh \u0027sag milleadh lAOchra le trEan-neart a shaoighid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [14] \"D\u0027 easgadh an pheacaidh, fóríor,\n\u003cbr\u003e Do sheól sinn faoi dhlighthibh námhad,\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan flathas Airt, ag pór Gaoidheal,\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan seóid puinn, gan cion gan áird,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Sgach bathlach bracach beól-bhuidhe\n\u003cbr\u003e De\u0027n chóip chríon do rith thar sáil\n\u003cbr\u003e I gceannas fla?th \u0027s i gcóimh-thigheas\n\u003cbr\u003e Le Móirín ni Chuillionáin.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is a verse from the same poem, but not the one above translated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [15] See \"Eachtraidh a\u0027 Phrionnsa le Iain Mac Coinnich,\" p. 270.
