Damn Americans! No sense of punctuality!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have called North Dakota himself, but he didn\u0027t have a phone number for him. Numataka hated doing business this way-with someone else in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought had crossed Numataka\u0027s mind from the beginning that the calls from North Dakota could be a hoax-a Japanese competitor playing him for the fool. Now the old doubts were coming back. Numataka decided he needed more information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe burst from his office and took a left down Numatech\u0027s main hallway. His employees bowed reverently as he stormed past. Numataka knew better than to believe they actually loved him-bowing was a courtesy Japanese employees offered even the most ruthless of bosses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka went directly to the company\u0027s main switchboard. All calls were handled by a single operator on a Corenco 2000, twelve-line switchboard terminal. The woman was busy but stood and bowed as Numataka entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I received a call at four forty-five on my personal line today. Can you tell me where it came from?\" Numataka kicked himself for not having done this earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator swallowed nervously. \"We don\u0027t have caller identification on this machine, sir. But I can contact the phone company. I\u0027m sure they can help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumataka had no doubt the phone company could help. In this digital age, privacy had become a thing of the past; there was a record of everything. Phone companies could tell you exactly who had called you and how long you\u0027d spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" he commanded. \"Let me know what you find out.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-34.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
