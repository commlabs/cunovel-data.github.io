I push her against the shower wall and kiss her with so much conviction, I know she could never for a second doubt how much I love her. I slide my hands down her thighs and lift her up until she wraps her legs around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press myself against her and continue kissing her, wanting to feel her, rather than the pain that’s trying to take over. I want nothing but to be a part of her right now and let everything else in our lives just fade away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me this is okay,” I say as I pull away from her mouth and search her eyes. “Tell me it’s okay to want to be inside you right now . . . because after everything we’ve been through today, it feels wrong to need you like I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe throws her arms around my neck and grasps my hair, pulling my mouth back to hers, showing me that she needs this just as much as I do. I groan and pull her away from the shower wall, then walk her out of the bathroom and into the bedroom. I drop her down onto the bed, then grab her panties and pull them down her legs. I crash against her mouth and pull off my boxers, which are now soaking wet. All I can think about is how much I need to be inside her right now. I pull apart from her long enough to get a condom on, then I grab her hips and pull her to the edge of the bed. I lift her leg to my side and slide my other arm underneath her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me and I look down at her. I grip her leg and her shoulder and keep my eyes trained on hers, then push into her. The second I’m inside her, it doesn’t feel like enough. I press my lips to hers and try to search for whatever it is that’s missing from the moment. I move in and out of her, more and more frantic with each thrust, trying desperately to reach a feeling that I don’t even know exists. She relaxes her body against mine, following my movements, allowing me to be in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t want that right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what’s wrong with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind is so exhausted and so tired and my heart hurts so much right now. I just need her to help me figure out how to stop trying to be the hero for once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull away from her and she looks up at me, never questioning why I’ve drastically slowed against her. She just brings her hands to my face and gently runs her fingers over my eyes and my lips and cheeks. I turn my mouth toward the inside of her palm and I kiss it, then drop down on top of her, stopping completely. I keep my gaze locked with hers and I pull her to me, then lift her up as I stand. I’m still inside her and she’s wrapped around me, so I turn my back to the bed and slide down to the floor. I lean forward and kiss her bottom lip softly, then her whole mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring a hand to her cheek and drop the other to her hip. I begin to move beneath her, slowly guiding her with my hand, wanting her to just take control. I need her to want to comfort me the same way that I always want to comfort her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know how I feel about you,” I whisper, staring into her eyes. “You know how much I love you. You know I would do whatever I could to take away your pain, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, never pulling her gaze from mine, even for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need that from you so fucking bad right now, Sky. I need to know you love me like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression grows soft and her eyes fill with compassion. She laces our hands together and places them over our hearts. She strokes her thumb against my hand and lifts up slightly, then slowly glides back down me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incredible sensation that rushes through my body causes my head to collapse against the mattress behind me. I groan, unable to keep my eyes open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open your eyes,” she whispers, still moving against me. “I want you to watch me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head and watch her. It’s the easiest thing I’ve ever been asked to do, because she’s fucking beautiful right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look away again,” she says, lifting herself up. When she slides back onto my lap, I can barely keep my head up. Especially when that moan escapes her lips and she squeezes my hands even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The first time you kissed me?” she says. “That moment when your lips touched mine? You stole a piece of my heart that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou stole a piece of mine, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The first time you told me you lived me because you weren’t ready to tell me you loved me yet? Those words stole another piece of my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did love you. I loved you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my hand and press it flat against her heart. “The night I found out I was Hope? I told you I wanted to be alone in my room. When I woke up and saw you in my bed I wanted to cry, Holder. I wanted to cry because I needed you there with me so bad. I knew in that moment that I was in love with you. I was in love with the way you loved me. When you wrapped your arms around me and held me, I knew that no matter what happened with my life, you were my home. You stole the biggest piece of my heart that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t steal it. You gave it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowers her mouth to mine and I drop my head back against the mattress and let her kiss me. “Keep them open,” she whispers, pulling away from my lips. I do what she says and somehow open my eyes again, looking directly into hers. “I want you to keep them open . . . because I need you to watch me give you the very last piece of my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis moment. Right now. It’s almost worth every ounce of pain I’ve ever had to endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tighten my grip on her hands and lean into her, but I don’t kiss her. We get as close as we possibly can and we keep our eyes open until the very last second. Until she completely consumes me and I completely consume her and I have no idea where my love ends and hers begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I begin to tremble and moan beneath her, my head falls against the mattress and she allows me to close my eyes this time. She continues to move on top of me until I’m completely and utterly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give my heart a second to calm down, then I lift my head and look at her. I remove my hands from hers and I slide them through her hair to the back of her head. My lips connect with hers and I kiss her, pushing her off me and onto the floor beneath me. I slide my hand between us and flatten my palm against her stomach, then slowly lower my hand until I find the exact spot that makes my favorite sound escape her mouth. I drink in every single moan and breath that passes her lips. And I let her keep her eyes closed, but I keep mine open and watch her steal the very last piece of my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have so much I want to say, but I don’t even know how to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything with Sky couldn’t have turned out better. She’s back home with Karen now where she belongs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Karen wouldn’t have harmed Sky. I could tell just from the little time I spent with them that Karen loved her as much as I did. It turns out, I was right. Karen took Sky from her father because Karen knew what he was doing to her. Karen was his sister . . . Sky’s aunt. And she had been through every single thing that Sky went through. She took her because she couldn’t just sit back and allow it to continue to happen. Now that Sky knows the whole truth, she’s decided to stay with Karen. Karen risked her entire life for that girl. She risked her entire future and I could never thank her enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said this to Sky and I’ll say it to you. The only thing I wish Karen would have done differently, is I wish she could have taken you, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know, Les. I had no idea what he was doing to you and I’m so sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll tell you more tomorrow, but tonight I just needed to tell you that I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappy Halloween. Sure hope you decide to wear something sexy for once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit send and set the phone on my nightstand, then climb out of bed. I didn’t leave Sky’s house until after four o’clock this morning, then I came home and wrote Les a note before I crawled into bed. It’s been days of little sleep and high emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the closet and grab a T-shirt, then pull it on over my head. My phone sounds off so I walk to it and pick it up to read her text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi, Holder. It’s Karen. Still haven’t returned Sky’s phone to her, but I’ll relay the message. Or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. I laugh and text Karen back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elol . . . sorry about that. But while I’m texting you, how is she today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait for her response, which doesn’t take long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s okay. She’s been through a lot and I know it’ll take time. But she’s the bravest girl I know, so I have complete faith in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and text her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. She kind of reminds me of her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe texts back a heart. I set my phone on the bed and sit down beside it. I pick it back up and scroll through it, finding my father’s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, Dad. Miss you. I’m thinking about bringing my girlfriend to visit during Thanksgiving break. I want you to meet her. Tell Pamela I promise to stay off her couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit send, but I know the text wasn’t enough, so I text him one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the phone down and look across the room to the notebook still lying on the floor where I threw it. The one that contains the majority of my notes to Les.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still don’t want to read it, but I feel like I owe it to her. I stand up and walk to it. I bend over and pick it up at the same time I lower myself to the floor. I lean against the wall and pull my knees up, then open the notebook and flip to the back of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-seven-and-a-half\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Holder,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re reading this, I’m so, so sorry. Because if you’re reading this, then I know what I did to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I really hope you never find this letter. I’m hoping whoever finds this notebook doesn’t see much use for it and throws it out, because I don’t want to break your heart. But I have so much I need to say to you that I’ll never be able to tell you face to face, so I’m doing it here, instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to start with what happened when we were kids. With Hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know how much you blamed yourself for walking away from her. But you need to realize that you weren’t the only one, Holder. I walked away from her, too. And you were doing what any other child in that situation would do. You were trusting that the adults in her life were doing what was right for her. How could you have anticipated what was going to happen when she walked to that car? You couldn’t have, so just stop thinking you could have done something differently. You couldn’t have and frankly, you shouldn’t have. Hope climbing into that car was the best thing that ever happened to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few weeks after she was taken, her father asked me if I wanted to help him make some flyers. Of course I wanted to help him. I would have done anything that would have helped bring Hope back to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked into his house, I could feel something wasn’t right. He walked me to her bedroom. He told me the materials for the flyers were in Hope’s room. Then he shut the door behind us and completely shattered my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt went on for years after that. It went on until the day I couldn’t bear it anymore and finally told Mom..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe immediately went to the police. That same day I was interviewed by a therapist and my confession was documented. I was only nine or ten years old, so I don’t remember a lot about it. I just remember that weeks went by and Mom and Dad had to go to the police station several times. The whole time all of this was going on, Hope’s father never once returned home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-hope-hopeless-2/page-41.html","bookId":2778,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:07 PM"}
