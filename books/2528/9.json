Berkfield immediately tried to sit up, but realized instantly that his hands and feet were strapped to a cold metal table. He tried to cry out, but his vocal cords were frozen. White-masked men in green surgeon\u0027s gowns peered down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the key ready?\" an eerily distant, accented voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the masked men around the table nodded and held up a huge needle containing a silvery red fluid. Terror seized Berkfield as he stared at the epidural-sized syringe. He shook his head no, wildly resisting in vain. That only produced strange, out-of-body laughter from an unknown source within the sterile lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inject him,\" the voice said. \"Then bring him to my chambers for the ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated comfortably in the rec room around the poker table, seven guardians sat in a circle, hands joined, eyes closed. Four members of the Covenant stood watch, each positioned in the four earth directions, north, south, east, and west. The men at the Guardians\u0027 backs kept vigil to prevent evil from attacking from all directions, murmuring prayers in different languages. Marlene\u0027s mouth moved, her silent meditation calling down the Light to watch over them, requesting discernment to open their eyes, to sharpen their gifts, and to locate their baby girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see her and I can\u0027t feel her,\" Marlene said quietly, her voice tight with frustration, \"and I\u0027ve been trying for nearly an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeads of sweat dotted her brow, and she dabbed at the offending moisture with the back of her forearm, not breaking the human circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re obviously blinding both the seers in the group to their whereabouts,\" Father Patrick said. \"But they can\u0027t block all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene nodded. \"We\u0027ll have to track them through a back door. If one of the other members at the table can pick up a sensitivity, then we might have a chance. One of us will eventually feel their vibrations, or hear them, perhaps pick up a scent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up to now, Marlene, you\u0027ve been trying to get an immediate sightline on them. Let\u0027s see if we can redirect that energy to the olfactory sensors, or the tacticals. Maybe Mike can hear something that will clue us in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s worth a shot, Mar,\" Rider said. \"If Jose and I can pick up some kinda tracer, then Father Pat\u0027s crew can trail it. We\u0027ll talk them through on walkie-talkie while keeping the circle connection going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, people,\" Marlene said on a weary sigh. \"Let\u0027s clear our thoughts, stretch our minds. We know she mentioned a lair in Beverly Hills, so envision the environment, the surroundings, the streets, feel the trees, and see the colors, close your eyes, open up your minds, hear the traffic, smell the freshly cut lawns, let your gifts guide you and send those impressions to each other then to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the sound of deep, steady inhales could be heard. Air-conditioner compressors around the compound hummed in the distance. A wall clock ticked ever so slightly. Water from a faucet in the next room dripped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jose breathed in deeply and tilted his head at the same moment Father Lopez did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to us, Jose,\" Marlene said, her voice low, melodic, calm. \"Impression... scent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJose took a deeper breath and squeezed Rider\u0027s hand harder. \"Smells so good,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rider,\" Marlene said, keeping the group steady, \"you picking up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mar. The young buck got this one. I\u0027m not picking up anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jose shuddered, everyone opened their eyes and stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay focused everybody, keep hands joined, stay relaxed. Jose, where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA palpable tension could be felt in the room. The squat white candle in the center of the ring of hands sputtered and flickered as an energy charged the atmosphere around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hurt?\" Marlene asked quickly, but her voice was still low and controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jose murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you by yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head no. His breathing deepened as his T-shirt became damp from sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The scent, is it vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jose said on a heavy exhale. \"Female, straight up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mar,\" Rider said. \"He found Damali. Think he\u0027s got a lock with our girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, bro,\" Jose said, slowly. \"Roses... blood ... oh, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene stiffened. \"Roses... are they outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jose whispered. \"Red everywhere...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s picking up tactical senses, which is beyond his gift range. Mar, pull him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Shabazz,\" she said through clenched teeth. \"He saw a color, which means that he\u0027s got a visual, something we haven\u0027t been able to get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShabazz eased back in his chair, casting a concerned glance around the team. Father Lopez stepped forward, bringing the other three Covenant members to the table with him, walking almost in lockstep with them so they wouldn\u0027t lose their protective directional position. Father Lopez laid his hand on Jose\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll connect with him directly, stay with his spirit to guide him and to be a second source of strength.\" Father Lopez looked away shyly. \"I feel things... and no offense, but I picked it up before Shabazz and J.L. did. I guess I\u0027m a tactical sensor, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Rider said, nodding. \"We almost lost our brother once before to some freak accident and I don\u0027t want to go there again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No he,\" Big Mike said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Father Lopez was squarely at Jose\u0027s back, Marlene began her inquiry again, pushing harder for answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red,\" she told Jose, \"concentrate on red. Is it blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, soft...\" he said and sighed. \"Satin and roses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I not surprised?\" Rider asked, blowing his breath out hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rider, please,\" Marlene warned. \"Jose, baby, open your mind\u0027s eye wider. Let Father Lopez\u0027s energy help you. Work with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all in the air... Neteru,\" Jose said, taking in a deep breath and shuddering. \"Her skin is like butter... and her throat.\" He licked his lips, and squeezed his shut eyes tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Marlene\u0027s voice was strained. Her gaze bore into Jose as sweat coursed down the sides of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Patrick put his hand on Marlene\u0027s shoulders. \"Steady, Mar. You\u0027ll lose the connection if you panic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the mansion - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden Father Lopez dropped his hands from Jose\u0027s shoulders and backed away from the group, hugging his arms about himself. \"I cannot do it,\" he said, shaking his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you feel, or see?\" Father Patrick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t what I saw,\" Father Lopez said quietly. \"It was what I felt.\" He staggered over to the wall, and leaned against it. The front of his black robe had a darkening stain that spread down his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team watched horrified as blood splattered the top of his shoe and oozed out onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s his femoral artery! Break circle! Now!\" Rider yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShabazz and Big Mike leapt forward and caught Father Lopez before he hit the ground. They slowly laid him on the floor. Two Guardians held their hands against the wound, applying pressure to the young cleric\u0027s inner thigh. J.L. ripped off his belt, and tossed it to Shabazz. Rider held the cleric\u0027s head up from the floor as his Guardian brothers worked to stop the hemorrhage. Marlene kept one hand on Jose\u0027s shoulders, Imam Asula kept one hand on the other. Father Patrick and Monk Lin covered their fallen brother with prayers, while the rest of the team stood in the distance, poised to act but not sure what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnatching the bowie knife from his hip, Rider passed the blade to Shabazz, who pushed up Father Lopez\u0027s robe and cut a long slit in the wounded cleric\u0027s pants. There was so much blood, they couldn\u0027t see the extent of the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get some holy water to clean the site,\" Big Mike yelled to Dan, who immediately dashed away and came back with a plastic jug from the weapon\u0027s room containing what Mike had requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShabazz doused the wound. Father Lopez screamed and convulsed. Marlene gasped when she saw two puncture wounds on the young man\u0027s inner thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit, he bit her!\" Marlene shrieked, breaking the connection. \"He\u0027s bleeding her out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No he\u0027s not,\" Jose said in a low, sensual tone. \"She bit him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" Father Patrick said, staring at Jose in shock. He looked down at Lopez and slapped his face. \"C\u0027mon, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just as quickly, the two puncture wounds sealed and the flow of blood stopped. Slowly, Father Lopez roused, his face ashen before it flushed a deep red, his breaths uneven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed himself, and struggled to sit up. The other guardians helped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God! Oh Father Christ!\" he said, his voice fracturing as he pushed hands away from him and made the sign of the cross over his chest again. \"She bit me... never in my life - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steady,\" Father Patrick said, soothing the distraught junior priest. \"What happened? Tell us exactly what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Lopez shook his head, and shut his eyes tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, son...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Lopez covered his face with his hands and breathed slowly. \"I am so ashamed. Don\u0027t ask me to tell you with a woman in the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRider threw up his hands. \"Y\u0027all gonna make me start smoking again. I\u0027ll tell you what the hell happened.\" He raked his fingers through his hair, hocked and spit in the wastebasket. \"Blood fucks with my sinuses,\" he muttered, dismissing the group\u0027s glare. \"She went down on hombre and took out his femoral artery at the moment of truth. Lopez and Jose were locked in on the master, not Damali.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRider nodded in Jose\u0027s direction, causing everyone to look toward Jose. \"Shabazz was right, shoulda pulled the man out. No human male can go the distance of a full vamp seduction. Get Jose unlocked before he has a fucking heart attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group quickly moved toward the young guardian. Jose\u0027s head hung down, one hand on his forehead. His forearm braced him on the table, his fist clenched, and the muscle in his jaw working. His T-shirt stuck to his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" he said in a voice so deep and so unnatural for Jose that for a moment no one moved. His fist pounded on the table, his breathing escalated, his eyes rolled beneath his lids. When he moaned low in his throat, Marlene grabbed him by the shoulders and hauled off and slapped him. Jose just gave her a lazy, satisfied laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShabazz stepped forward and dashed the remaining holy water in Jose\u0027s face, but Jose still didn\u0027t come around. \"He\u0027s blitzed on Neteru. Pull him out, Mar, before Damali takes his jugular!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Lopez stood, weaving. \"I took the first bite and oh, God, it felt so good,\" he whispered. \"Pull us both out of this bond�now - before she takes the jugular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTotal pandemonium erupted as the team broke into two squads, each slapping, dousing, working on the two connected men. Marlene was in Jose\u0027s face, recanting the connection, trying to bring him up out of the trance, while the other seer, Father Patrick, worked on his young cleric, anxiety rising by the minute when the fallen wouldn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to shoot them before Damali turns them,\" Shabazz said, unholstering his weapon and pointing the barrel of the gun at Jose\u0027s temple. Jose immediately lifted his head and looked at Shabazz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you insane, man?\" Rider yelled, slamming into Shabazz, throwing his aim off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as soon as Shabazz had pointed the gun at Jose, the trance had been broken. Jose sat there looking dazed. Imam Asula nodded, whipped out his machete, and pressed it to Father Lopez\u0027s throat. Father Lopez immediately snapped out of it as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck?\" Rider said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShabazz holstered Sleeping Beauty. \"A master is most vulnerable when he\u0027s asleep, when he hasn\u0027t fed, or when he\u0027s gettin\u0027 busy, but will always pull up when there\u0027s an eminent threat.\" He stroked his gun, and nodded in Asula\u0027s direction. \"So me and brotherman provided an eminent threat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene sat down slowly at the table and let her head drop into her hands. \"I know you two gentlemen have just been through something outrageous, and I\u0027m sorry you had to go there,\" she said, speaking to Jose and Lopez. \"But can you tell us anything about where they are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Lopez nodded. \"They\u0027re at the mansion in Beverly Hills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJose nodded weakly. \"Nuit\u0027s old joint,\" he said slowly. \"Carlos is seriously pissed off, and something is trailing enough sulfur there for Rider to track it. There\u0027s weird noises, barking, that Mike can track. I don\u0027t know what it was but if I caught the scent again, I\u0027d know it.\" He looked away, his face suddenly stained with embarrassment. \"And I can track Damali now, easy.\" He rubbed his nose with the back of his hand, and shuddered one last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\" Marlene stood and paced away from the table. \"Okay, okay, we have to mount up. Maybe there\u0027s a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, baby,\" Shabazz said quietly, going to her, \"we have to mount up a posse, but not to save her. We\u0027re gonna have to find them and smoke \u0027em both.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bitten-vampire-huntress-legend-4/page-9.html","bookId":2528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:52 PM"}
