She blinked at him, and patted the ottoman. \"Come here and sit. Pick up your plate and hand me the fork.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head at her, considering. Marcus was a silent presence in her peripheral vision. Giving Josh time to think was no chore, and she made good use of the moment, sliding her gaze over the bare broad shoulders, the smooth chest, that tantalizing slope of hipbone exposed by the loose fit of the jeans at the waist. She let her gaze go lower, examining with frank interest the way the denim molded his groin and long thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe consumed the visual feast through all her senses, so it was no surprise to feel her breasts tighten, the nipples rise against the silk fabric of the robe, poured like water over her curves from the blessings of gravity. She knew without raising her eyes that his gaze would be drawn to that physical reaction. Unless his personal demons were too strong, her wary prey should almost be hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she got to his bare toes, they were moving toward her, and a moment later, he was sitting on the ottoman, lifting the plate and handing her the fork. This close, he brought back the smell of the woods, and his faint musky odor, the same dried sweat of a day\u0027s hard labor that she had smelled when he had carried her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Lauren speared a tiny corncob and lifted it, \"I know Marcus is a New York art dealer with a secret dream to be a hairdresser,\" she smiled as that one raised his glass with a devious grin, his composure recovered. \"But what did you do before you were caretaker here, Josh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I helped Marcus,\" he lifted a shoulder, and she knew he was being evasive from the quick flick of his gaze away from hers. It was not yet time to push, too early in the game. She raised a brow regardless, letting him know he was not fooling her, but she changed the flow of the conversation. \"Marcus, tell us the most wicked story you can think of from your childhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before puberty, or after?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren slanted a smile at him. \"Before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought the glistening pale yellow vegetable to Josh\u0027s lips. When he had his mouth half open, she murmured \"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traced it over his top lip, moistening the curve with a light sheen of soy sauce, as he had done to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were on her face, measuring, and she inclined her head. \"Open your mouth wider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did, sending a jolt of electric energy through her vitals. She placed the food on his tongue, already wet from saliva that she hoped was not entirely from a hunger for food. His lips closed on the fork, the soy sauce she had left there compressing between them. The lubricated tines withdrew with the same silken ease of a man withdrawing himself from a woman\u0027s aroused body. As she anticipated, his tongue automatically touched on his top lip after he swallowed, collecting the sauce. His eyes never left hers, and she wondered that she could have every considered gray a cool color. It could become molten steel, simmering with the fires of the forge, anticipating becoming an instrument to serve the needs of its master, or in this case, mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not a docile sub, which delighted her. The heat in those eyes could compete with the re-entry atmosphere of the earth, and she felt it building in the furnace of his body. He would become dangerous if pushed, and the anticipation of it shivered through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This game is like a circus,\" Maria had told her once, during one of their many infamous \"Corner Table Conversations\", as Lauren had dubbed them. That was when Maria had a break and the two of them found a corner table in the shadows. Sometimes it was a time for Maria to hold her hand while Lauren had yet another post-Jonathan meltdown, but usually it was a chance to exchange wisdom and watch others together. The waitress followed the interactions of the other club attendees with the diligent attention of a NASA researcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we that ridiculous?\" Lauren asked, too swamped at that point with bitterness to hear the undertone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking clowns, honey.\" Maria said, her kohl rimmed eyes crinkling, the moist, full lips curving up. \"Think of all the sensual, dark undertones of a circus. The life of the people involved, set apart from the rest of the civilized world in a mysterious society of their own. Those who walk the tight rope and run the trapeze, who must trust their partners completely. The delicate interplay between the animals and those who go into the cage with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you,\" she ran a sharp-nailed finger lightly down Lauren\u0027s face, tracing the tiny tab protecting the entrance to her ear. \"You\u0027re a lion tamer. Jonathan belonged in the poodle ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren snorted with laughter, and Maria\u0027s teeth showed, but it was a half smile, most of her mind focused on a more serious point. \"He was eager to please, never messing up, working for treats, regardless of whose hand gave them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren\u0027s eyes darkened, but Maria kept on. \"You were looking for the lion, the one who obeyed because he knew the reward for obedience was you. Not some treat from your hand, but you, everything, body, mind and soul. He knows he\u0027s bigger and stronger, but he\u0027ll concede your dominance and lower his eyes because you make him want to do it. Even so, he\u0027ll still occasionally test you, because that\u0027s the nature of the lion. That\u0027s what you were wanting, and that\u0027s the only thing that\u0027s going to work for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria hadn\u0027t needed to tell her that finding that man would involve a game of high stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a bite herself, and her eyes fell shut as a savory marriage of onion, pepper, soy and a mysterious dash of other spices awoke her taste buds. \"This is marvelous. How did you make something this good in a half hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, technically, you can reach orgasm in less than a minute, and think how wonderful that is,\" Marcus, pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh grinned, and Lauren conceded the point with a wave of the fork. \"I\u0027m getting very little food here,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh nodded to the plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren snorted and slid another forkful of sauteed vegetables into his mouth. \"Marcus, we\u0027re waiting for your wicked tale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wicked tale,\" Marcus mused, took a chunk of French bread from the board on the table, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The word itself calls it to mind. When I was seven, I had a dog named Winslow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winslow?\" Josh turned his head and Lauren bumped the fork against his chin, splattering his left pectoral with brown sauce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops,\" she took her index and middle fingers and wiped them over the spot, gathering up the moisture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingernails scraped his warm skin. She caught one of the drips alongside his nipple and traced the curve as she scooped up the liquid. The crinkled skin around it became taut at her touch and she brought the fingers toward her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh reached out and manacled her wrist, pulling her fingers away from her mouth and taking them to his, drawing them into the warm cavern and sucking off the brown liquid, tracing his tongue lightly over the delicate skin between the two fingers. The movement of his tongue was not like the flick of a flame, but a slow pressure that rubbed each taste bud against the crevices of her finger joints like moist sand trickling over bare skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren managed not to swallow her own tongue, barely. She began to draw her hand away. Her heart bumped up into her throat when he did not respond to the pressure, holding her slim wrist captured in his grasp for the space of several irregular beats before his grip loosened. Lauren tapped her moistened finger against his bottom lip reprovingly. \"It\u0027s my card, Josh. I\u0027m feeding you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It rather looked like that\u0027s what you were doing,\" Marcus observed dryly. \"Do you want me to continue, or can I just enjoy the floorshow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh chuckled and Lauren smiled at the way it took ten years off his serious face. \"No,\" she tossed her hair back. \"I want to hear the story about Winslow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winslow was a wonderful dog who unfortunately had a penchant for chasing cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That dog\u0027s name was not Winslow,\" Josh shifted his intense gaze off her, allowing Lauren to take a deep, steadying breath without his scrutiny. \"No kid names their dog Winslow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, if you insist on mundane authenticity, it was Petey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the Little Rascals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Marcus sighed. \"I suppose I was as monotonous and tritely cliched as all children. Petey was the best I could do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he always play the world-weary urbanite?\" Lauren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh nodded. \"Only in front of guests. Once he gets used to you, you\u0027ll see his real personality. Iowa farm boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" Lauren laughed at Marcus\u0027s woeful nod. \"Your secret\u0027s safe with me,\" she raised her hand in pledge, then fed Josh another mouthful, her attention shifting back to the movement of his jaw, the flex of cords and muscle along his throat as he swallowed. \"How did Petey fit into the most wicked thing you did in childhood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, loving though woefully misnomered Petey finally caught a car. My father assured me and my cousins that Petey would ascend to the place where dogs may cheerfully chase cars all day long without fear of harm. However, four days after Petey\u0027s demise, I came to my father in great distress. Petey had not gone to heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus put down the wine glass and turned the stem with elegant fingers, the glass and burgundy liquid reflecting the candlelight. \"\u0027Of course he has, son,\u0027 my father assures me with great confidence, giving me that healthy backslap heterosexual fathers offer to ensure their sons need chiropractic care for the remainder of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027No, he hasn\u0027t,\u0027 I insist. \u0027Come see.\u0027 For I knew my father had to see proof of what I was saying to understand. I took him to Petey\u0027s grave and pointed down at it. \u0027See? We buried him with his tail sticking up out of the grave so we\u0027d know when he went, and it\u0027s still there!\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren choked on the wine she had raised to her lips for another sip and caught the juice as it tried to escape down her chin. \"Marcus, that\u0027s terrible,\" she giggled, unable to help herself. She scrabbled for a napkin to prevent the escaped wine from running down her throat and staining her robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me,\" Josh leaned forward. Lauren followed the direction of his eyes and felt the wine trickle down into the hollow formed by her collarbone. He paused briefly, his cheek almost brushing hers, and looked sidelong into her eyes. She gave an almost imperceptible jerk of her head, a nod of assent, and his head dipped, his dark hair brushing her jaw line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes promised revenge for her earlier torture. There was playful mischief in his expression, as well as serious, sensual intent. It was a combination she found as thrilling as her first Ferris wheel ride, which had happened on a crisp fall night filled with sparkling lights, the smell of popcorn and funnel cakes. She teetered on the edge of womanhood that night, made even more ripe and confusing by the knowing, secretive gazes of the male carnies who ran the rides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis warm lips covered the area, that clever tongue creating a warm, spiraling friction against her heated skin. Lauren sucked in a breath, which brought the top of her breast into contact with his chin. Sensation prickled to the tip and a light shudder ran from breast to thigh, making her toes curl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost men did not know what an erogenous zone a woman\u0027s neck was. Whether he did or not, Josh was giving it special attention, rubbing his lips up the side of the main artery, and Lauren had to keep her hands clenched at her sides to keep from taking him to the floor and devouring him whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus kept his eyes on hers throughout the moment, like a naturalist in a secluded glade, unobtrusive and yet very present, enjoying the experience of watching the interplay of God\u0027s creations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when Josh straightened, Marcus\u0027s gaze dropped from her face and followed the ridge of the other man\u0027s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren,\" Marcus said, \"I think you were deciding your next wish was that we play Monopoly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" She blinked at him hazily, feeling somewhat like a person who has misread an invitation and shown up at a neighborhood barbecue in formal wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze slid back to Josh\u0027s bare skin. \"Well, the high card belongs to you, and you just strike me as an obsessive Monopoly player. I also happen to know Lisette has one in her closet. She plays herself, you know. Actually, four of herselves. A game will stretch on for days, in between her writing sessions. She says when things get too intense, when reality intrudes and locks up her creative mind with fretting about deadlines or editors, or other such drivel, she goes and plays a few rounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just how long does the game say I hold the high card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long did you say you were going to be here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren decided that Marcus was altogether the strangest person she had met in quite some time, and that she liked him intensely. \"Josh, Marcus,\" she shifted her attention between them, \"I command you to play Monopoly with me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/holding-the-cards-nature-of-desire-1/page-6.html","bookId":1906,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:08 PM"}
