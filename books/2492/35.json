The lunch I had threatening to make a reappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bunch of small pieces of the puzzle came together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy ran into the dojo, took one look at the Graysheets and said, \"Don\u0027t do it. She wasn\u0027t going to say anything. Call it off,\" he said, his eyes frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher turned to him. \"Okay, I give up. Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy ignored Lewis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay out of this. You\u0027ve been compromised. You never get emotionally involved with the target. I told Parker you were the wrong fit, Buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at who I\u0027d thought was Buddy. Taking in his stature, as a guy. It was so obvious now that he was older. If I\u0027d been paying attention, I would\u0027ve seen it right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, someone had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps. He\u0027d had his eye on him from the very beginning. And I\u0027d fought him, finding him a worthy opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo worthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they were going to kill the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the car again, Jade sleeping safely inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I looked at Sensei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection came like a jagged avalanche of glass, tearing my guts up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleeping safely inside my locked car, Sensei was the attacker. He was behind locked bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy memory burned with the image of Sophie collapsed on the asphalt outside the dojo, then paused over the bundle that was Jade. In my car, the blackness of her hair covering her face except for the tip of her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensei Anderson was the Astral Projection attacker. He was currently protected by six armed Graysheets, I didn\u0027t have any dead at my disposal and they had a Telekinetic on board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnguish pierced me like a sword finding its home, bile burning a brutal pathway up my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade burrowed under the scratchy blanket that was in the back of the car, the seat\u0027s tight configuration a perfect embrace for the cocoon of rest she felt hovering at the edge of her consciousness. She heard the door locks snap into place and gave a small smile at Caleb\u0027s over protectiveness. She made a show for him but it secretly pleased her that he cared about her so much. She just didn\u0027t want him to feel like he had to. He was an awesome boyfriend. Except for the zombie thing. She was with Sophie, they were kinda scary. Their eyes especially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s breathing became heavy and even, the misery of her memories slipping away, her body using the deep slumber to finesse the last little bit of the healing session she\u0027d just come from. Her body knitting into perfection once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade awoke in space filled with whiteness and looked around. She had never felt more awake but knew she was somewhere strange, the perimeter of where she was cloud-like, the walls a soft, billowy material. She was in a cotton ball world. What a weird dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she noticed what she was wearing. A long dress draped her, in the deepest emerald. The deep vee of the bodice had a glittering fine webbing of jet black stones that sparkled like diamonds, making the dress look like it had a black wash covering it, sparkling above a green sea. It reminded her of her dream catcher at home. Her hand flew to her neck automatically, to find only her collarbone, bare of the gift from Caleb. Her only jewelry was a bracelet in a shimmering jeweled rainbow from the softest black to a deep onyx that rode her small wrist, slipping coldly along the bone on the left. It slid back and forth over the bump as she looked at what she was wearing, the fabric felt like satin but hung like silk, a high heeled shoe peeking out from beneath it, raven\u0027s wing black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pulse sped up. Something was wrong. The quality of the dream was entirely too real. The things she wore, bizarre. She reached out to touch the wall and an emotional torrent crashed into her, stealing her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was realm. Jade became instantly afraid. She had no right to be in realm. That was for Astral Projectionists. Not Empaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless... Jade looked around frantically, her hair coming loose from its elaborate binding, a black strand falling against the skin of her back, tickling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes locked on a form coming through the wall, slowly revealed to her as if hidden by mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie came through the wall, the whiteness of her gown in direct contrast to the coffee kissed color of her skin. Jade\u0027s eyes locked with hers and she knew that Sophie realized instantly that something was wrong. She grabbed a handful of her white gown and ran to Jade, her silver spiked heels making no noise in realm, absorbed like she\u0027d never been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" Sophie asked breathlessly, clutching Jade\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, I was gonna ask you. I fell asleep in Caleb\u0027s car and woke up here.\" Jade spread her hands away from her body, Sophie\u0027s hand falling away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I in realm? I mean, that is where I\u0027m at... \" Jade asked, trying to still the trembling in her hands, finally giving up and clenching them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie shook her head, her fluffy hair tightly contained in an elaborate up do, a few tendrils clinging tenaciously to the back of her neck. Jade watched Sophie think about it. Then slowly, she turned her forearm over and an angry puncture became visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade and Sophie looked at each other. \"The depressant,\" Sophie began slowly. Jade shrugged, she\u0027d missed her dose on Wednesday because of the healing session. \"I was given the three month dose like everyone but it should only allow realm at night... \" Sophie\u0027s eyes met hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless they gave you a different dose,\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A different kind,\" Sophie emphasized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it dawned on Jade. \"What if they gave you something specifically that was different than the normal dose? That would make you sleep and allow realm at the same time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie looked at Jade. \"That would mean that the attacker guy was working with the government. That Amanda as a victim was a decoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was never the one they wanted to get. Buddy interrupted him trying to get you,\" Jade said, realization dawning within her in an ugly spiral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie\u0027s aqua eyes searched Jade\u0027s green ones. \"Why am I here though Soph? I\u0027m not AP!\" Jade said, grabbing Sophie\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind them they heard a male\u0027s voice say, \"It\u0027s a twofer, that\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned and Jade was stunned beyond words, her mouth dropping open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u0027s judo instructor stood there in an absurd looking white tuxedo. The bow tie and cummerbund were a deep scarlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike splashes of blood on his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie and Jade backed away, the fingers of their hands entwined together like two fragile insects caught in a web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spider came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensei Anderson had to die. The bars of the closet locked from the outside and six Graysheets guarding him didn\u0027t negate that necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he would kill Jade and Sophie. Because Sophie had seen a foreign leader murdered, then sign a forged document as a zombie. She was witness. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade because... why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my chest against the barrel and through gritted teeth asked, \"Why Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, clicking the hammer back. \"To cripple you, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked into my face and said, \"We take away the thing you care about and there\u0027s no reason why you won\u0027t join us. We have much you need to accomplish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I understood what my advantage was. They needed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes swept my friends, John, Alex and the new guy, Archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Archer!\" I bellowed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got you!\" Archer said from a pace behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing my body as a shield he slid behind me and wrapped a hand around the barrel of the gun. I heard the hammer click and knew he\u0027d locked the gun up. Skinny-Smoker got a surprised look on his face and I slammed the barrel, stock first back into his chest in a smooth jab, my palm shrieking with the force of the move. Archer ducked and rolled and I felt my body lifted off my feet and I flew backward, slamming into the only wall without mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Telekinetic had used his power to heave me like a rag doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth snapped together on impact and I bit my tongue, blood welling into my mouth like a copper river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn grunted and the Telekinetic faced off with him, another Graysheet breaking away with the Telekinetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured that turd was a Null.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gathered everything that was my power in a tight fist as I slid down the wall, my bell rung, my head spinning and had a singular thought:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde! my mind shouted, the call shattering the boundaries like glass brick, the shards flying in a radius even I didn\u0027t know how far it reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Tiff yell and collapse to her knees outside, her hands covering her ears and knew I\u0027d hurt her somehow and I was sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know where Clyde was but that was my last coherent thought before I gave Alex the look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis was more than a Lock-Manipulator and rolled on the ground as a fully automatic weapon made its way toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy dropped to the ground in a dead faint and I knew he was going in to help the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my dull brain understood it, somehow... he was a Graysheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grabbed the barrel of the gun that was pointed at Archer\u0027s forehead and flung it away before a bullet was driven into Lewis\u0027 face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkinny-Smoker recovered and screamed, \"Shoot the Body!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a bullet hitting home sounded in the echoing space, the impact spinning Alex around and making him topple like a mighty tree, his arm sailing backward to try to soften the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher tried to grab the barrel of the other Graysheets\u0027s gun but it was sizzling hot from the discharge and he howled in response, the second gun trained on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung open so hard it shattered the glass of the dojo window that sat beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Clyde and Company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear I was so stunned my heart hiccuped while my bowels clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps had arrived with the puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought fainting for the first time in my life, my head a spinning thing atop my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced my head between my knees and then stood up, throwing my palm behind me in an effort to stay upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps was engaged with the two Graysheets who had caused John to pant and sweat to run down his face, a fine trembling causing his arms to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you gents disarm before I have to blow a couple holes in ya?\" Gramps said conversationally, the puppy pointed at the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde clenched his hands and hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps eyes flicked to Clyde then landed back on the Graysheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up old man, we know what you were about back in the day, but it\u0027s this boy\u0027s turn to meet his maker and I aim to make it happen,\" the Graysheet said, Archer\u0027s face a shade of pale that shouldn\u0027t be a skin color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps gave a grim smile and responded, \"A follow-through guy? Well... me too.\" And with that, he blew off the agent\u0027s hand at the wrist, with a whole lot of peripheral shot pelting him for good measure. That KEL-TEC KSG bullpup shotgun would put a ton of shot-love into a person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes indeedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent screamed, grabbing the stump of his arm while blood geysered out of it like a fire hydrant. He began staggering around, his follow-through long forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other agents woke up as if from a dream, seeming to notice the Threat that was Gramps too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised the shotgun to the two that were working John over while I ran to Alex. \"Are ya okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his lips blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely not okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two stay like that, I got plenty of shot for the both of ya. Move and I make you holy.\" Gramps laughed at his own pun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCripes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkinny-Smoker began working his way toward the bars that held Sensei Anderson and I just knew that he meant to keep us from him. If we could get to Sensei, we could save the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gramps!\" I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup,\" he yelled back, the shotgun steady on the two Graysheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My judo teacher is trying to kill Sophie and Jade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bastard,\" Gramps said, the puppy unwavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Clyde and saw that somehow, in the midst of the chaos, Onyx had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog had heard the desperate call from his boy and broken the directive about letting the liquid go and to return to the cave immediately. Instead, he had escaped the prison that was attached to the boy\u0027s cave, heading toward the call. He could feel one of the dead creatures coming as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey converged together and the Dead One made the Dog understand that there was a feral pack of great strength with many alphas that threatened the Master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho, of course, was his Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran. The Dog ran until his lungs burned, and the pads of his feet ached. When he thought he could run no more he used that energy that the Boy\u0027s call had given him. It ran on a current into his body, allowing speed, dexterity and a momentum that the Dog did not usually possess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not tire again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, his nose had found the scent of the call. The scenery as he ran the back roads rushing by him in a colorful blur of grays and blacks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-35.html","bookId":2492,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM"}
