How much did he know about him? How much did anyone know about him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You talk to God,” said Lu-Tze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Signs. Man who talk to God have difficult life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re right!” Brutha stared at Lu-Tze over the cup. “Why are you here?” he said. “You\u0027re not Omnian. Or Ephebian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grew up near Hub. Long time ago. Now Lu-Tze a stranger everywhere he goes. Best way. Learned religion in temple at home. Now go where job is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carting soil and pruning plants?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Never been bishop or high panjandrum. Dangerous life. Always be man who cleans pews or sweeps up behind altar. No one bother useful man. No one bother small man. No one remember name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s what I was going to do! But it doesn\u0027t work for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then find other way. I learn in temple. Taught by ancient master. When trouble, always remember wise words of ancient and venerable master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ancient master say: `That boy there! What you eating? Hope you brought enough for everybody!\u0027 Ancient master say: `You bad boy! Why you no do homework?\u0027 Ancient master say: `What boy laughing? No tell what boy laughing, whole dojo stay in after school!\u0027 When remember these wise words, nothing seems so bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What shall I do? I can\u0027t hear him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do what you must. I learn anything, it you have to walk it all alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha hugged his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he told me nothing! Where\u0027s all this wisdom? All the other prophets came back with commandments!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where they get them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . . suppose they made them up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get them from same place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You call this philosophy?” roared Didactylos, waving his stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn cleaned pieces of the sand mold from the lever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well . . . natural philosophy,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stick whanged down on the Moving Turtle\u0027s flanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never taught you this sort of thing!” shouted the philosopher. “Philosophy is supposed to make life better! ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This will make it better for a lot of people,” said Urn, calmly. “It will help overthrow a tyrant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then?” said Didactylos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then you\u0027ll take it to bits, will you?” said the old man. “Smash it up? Take the wheels off? Get rid of all those spikes? Burn the plans? Yes? When it\u0027s served its purpose, yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well- Urn began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aha what? What if we do keep it? It\u0027ll be a . . . a deterrent to other tyrants!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think tyrants won\u0027t build \u0027em too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well . . . I can build bigger ones!” Urn shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos sagged. “Yes,” he said. \"No doubt you can. So that\u0027s all right, then. My word. And to think I was worrying. And now . . . I think I\u0027ll go and have a rest somewhere . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked hunched up, and suddenly old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master?” said Urn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t `master\u0027 me,” said Didactylos, feeling his way along the barn walls to the door. “I can see you know every bloody thing there is to know about human nature now. Hah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great God Om slid down the side of an irrigation ditch and landed on his back in the weeds at the bottom. He righted himself by gripping a root with his mouth and hauling himself over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shape of Brutha\u0027s thoughts flickered back and forth in his mind. He couldn\u0027t make out any actual words, but he didn\u0027t need to, any more than you needed to see the ripples to know which way the river flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, when he could see the Citadel as a gleaming dot in the twilight, he\u0027d try shouting his own mind back as loudly as he could:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! Wait! You don\u0027t want to do that! We can go to Ankh-Morpork! Land of opportunity! With my brains and your . . . with you, the world is our mollusk! Why throw it all away . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he\u0027d slide into another furrow. Once or twice he saw the eagle, forever circling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why put your hand into a grinder? This place deserves Vorbis! Sheep deserve to be led!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been like this when his very first believer had been stoned to death. Of course, by then he had dozens of other believers. But it had been a wrench. It had been upsetting. You never forgot your first believer. They gave you shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTortoises are not well equipped for cross-country navigation. They need longer legs or shallower ditches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm estimated that he was doing less than a fifth of a mile an hour in a direct line, and the Citadel was at least twenty miles away. Occasionally he made good time between the trees in an olive grove, but that was more than pulled back by rocky ground and field walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the time, as his legs whirred, Brutha\u0027s thoughts buzzed in his head like a distant bee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried shouting in his mind again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027ve you got? He\u0027s got an army! You\u0027ve got an army? How many divisions have you got?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut thoughts like that needed energy, and there was a limit to the amount of energy available in one tortoise. He found a bunch of fallen grapes and gobbled them until the juice covered his head, but it didn\u0027t make a lot of difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was nightfall. Nights here weren\u0027t as cold as the desert, but they weren\u0027t as warm as the day. He\u0027d slow down at night as his blood cooled. He wouldn\u0027t be able to think as fast. Or walk as fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was losing heat already. Heat meant speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled himself up on to an anthill-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re going to die! You\u0027re going to die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-and slid down the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreparations for the inauguration of the Cenobiarch Prophet began many hours before the dawn. Firstly, and not according to ancient tradition, there was a very careful search of the temple by Deacon Cusp and some of his colleagues. There was a prowling for tripwires and a poking of odd corners for hidden archers. Although it was against the thread, Deacon Cusp had his head screwed on. He also sent a few squads into the town to round up the usual suspects. The Quisition always found it advisable to leave a few suspects at large. Then you knew where to find them when you needed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that a dozen lesser priests arrived to shrive the premises and drive out all afreets, djinns, and devils. Deacon Cusp watched them without comment. He\u0027d never had any personal dealings with supernatural entities, but he knew what a well-placed arrow would do to an unexpecting stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone tapped him on the rib-cage. He gasped at the sudden linkage of real life into the chain of thought, and reached instinctively for his dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLu-Tze nodded and smiled and indicated with his broom that Deacon Cusp was standing on a patch of floor that he, Lu-Tze, wished to sweep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, you ghastly little yellow fool,” said Deacon Cusp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNod, smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never say a bloody word, do you?” said Deacon Cusp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmile, smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Idiot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmile. Smile. Watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn stood back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” he said, “you sure you\u0027ve got it all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy,” said Simony, who was sitting in the Turtle\u0027s saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me again,” said Urn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We-stoke-up-the-firebox,” said Simony. “Then-when-the?red-needle-points-to-xxvi, turn-the-brass-tap; when-the-bronze-whistle-blows, pull-the-big-lever. And steer by pulling the ropes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” said Urn. But he still looked doubtful. “It\u0027s a precision device,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I am a professional soldier,” said Simony. “I\u0027m not a superstitious peasant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, fine. Well . . . if you\u0027re sure . . . \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d had time to put a few finishing touches to the Moving Turtle. There were serrated edges to the shell and spikes on the wheels. And of course the waste steam pipe . . . he was a little uncertain about the waste steam pipe . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s merely a device,” said Simony. “It does not present a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give us an hour, then. You should just get to the Temple by the time we get the doors open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. Understood. Off you go. Sergeant Fergmen knows the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn looked at the steam pipe and bit his lip. I don\u0027t know what effect it\u0027s going to have on the enemy, he thought, but it scares the hells out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha woke up, or at least ceased trying to sleep. Lu-Tze had gone. Probably sweeping somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wandered through the deserted corridors of the novice section. It would be hours before the new Cenobiarch was crowned. There were dozens of ceremonies to be undertaken first. Everyone who was anyone would be in the Place and the surrounding piazzas, and so would the even greater number of people who were no one very much. The sestinas were empty, the endless prayers left unsung. The Citadel might have been dead, were it not for the huge indefinable background roar of tens of thousands of people being silent. Sunlight filtered down through the light-wells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha had never felt more alone. The wilderness had been a feast of fun compared to this. Last night . . . last night, with Lu-Tze, it had all seemed so clear. Last night he had been in a mood to confront Vorbis there and then. Last night there seemed to be a chance. Anything was possible last night. That was the trouble with last nights. They were always followed by this mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wandered out into the kitchen level, and then into the outside world. There were one or two cooks around, preparing the ceremonial meal of meat, bread, and salt, but they paid him no attention at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down outside one of the slaughterhouses. There was, he knew, a back gate somewhere around. Probably no one would stop him, today, if he walked out. Today they would be looking for unwanted people walking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could just walk away. The wilderness had seemed quite pleasant, apart from the thirst and hunger. St. Ungulant with his madness and his mushrooms seemed to have life exactly right. It didn\u0027t matter if you fooled yourself provided you didn\u0027t let yourself know it, and did it well. Life was so much simpler, in the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were a dozen guards by the gate. They had an unsympathetic look. He went back to his seat, which was tucked away in a corner, and stared gloomily at the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Om was alive, surely he could send a sign?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grating by Brutha\u0027s sandals lifted itself up a few inches and slid aside. He stared at the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hooded head appeared, stared back, and disappeared again. There was a subterranean whispering. The head reappeared, and was followed by a body. It pulled itself on to the cobbles. The hood was pushed back. The man grinned conspiratorially at Brutha, put his finger to his lips and then, without warning, launched himself at him with violent intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha rolled across the cobbles and raised his hands frantically as he saw the gleam of metal. One filthy hand clamped against his mouth. A knifeblade made a dramatic and very final silhouette against the light-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? We said the first thing we\u0027ll do, we\u0027ll kill all the priests!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha dared to swivel his eyes sideways. Although the second figure rising from the hole was also wearing a filthy robe, there was no mistaking the paintbrush hairstyle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-41.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
