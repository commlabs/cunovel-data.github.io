Their faces were at once familiar, and yet they were still strangers, too, in many ways. “I suppose they\u0027re my family, too, now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Them especially. You know they\u0027ve always loved you.” He laughed low. “Perhaps a bit too much. That day you appeared on the beach, I thought I might have to strangle Gregor. And then there\u0027s Bridget. I think my distance from you vexed her most of all.” He sighed, stroking her hand. “I only wish our mothers were here to see it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we were still babes when they first wished for this wedding.” She twined her fingers with his. “They were always so close. It\u0027s funny to realize how young they were. I remember overhearing them jesting about me and one of the MacAlpin boys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though on cue, Aidan rose. Thinking nobody watched him, he strolled from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pang of sadness pierced her joy. She wondered if that MacAlpin boy would ever find peace. Aidan had vowed to find the man who\u0027d stolen him, but Marjorie couldn\u0027t help but wish he\u0027d let go of the past and move on. “I wish he\u0027d give up this quest of his.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac squeezed her hand. “My brother will never give up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a shock to see him again.” She knew Cormac had always battled guilt, and she looked for it now on his face. Getting his brother back was cause to rejoice, but she knew, for Cormac, seeing proof of Aidan\u0027s misery would mean his guilt redoubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavie scrambled past suddenly, and they both laughed, torn from their reverie. The boy ran straight for Fiona, tangling himself in her skirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now there\u0027s the real shock.” Cormac eyed Fiona. “Wedding the young physician surgeon. Your maid is an enterprising one indeed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudged him with her shoulder. “She\u0027s a married woman and no longer my maid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, but such a hasty betrothal.” He nudged her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mock not, Cormac MacAlpin. I think it\u0027s lovely how Fiona and Arch took Davie into their care.” She giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Though the whole thing was a wee bit on the hurried side.” She had raised a brow at that, but having abandoned her maidenhead in an Aberdeen Inn, she wasn\u0027t one to throw stones. “They\u0027re simply getting a fast start on their family,” she reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched Fiona squat down to straighten Davie\u0027s shirt. “Will you miss her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fiona?” Marjorie smiled, thinking she would miss her. But she\u0027d quickly grown fond of the wee scullion girl who\u0027d been promoted as her replacement — not to mention how touched and amused she was by the soft spot Cormac had already shown the younger girl. “Actually, I\u0027m happy for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes went back to Cormac\u0027s twin, standing on the periphery. “I wish I were happier for him, though.” The growing shadows emphasized the darkness on Aidan\u0027s face. No longer was he the happy-go-lucky scamp of their youth. Something dark lurked deep inside him. She wished he\u0027d abandon this insane wish for retribution. She\u0027d convince him, she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d help Aidan, her and Cormac both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband. The thought made her swoon. Grinning broadly, she snuck her hand around and gave a surreptitious tweak to his backside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re a saucy one.” He laughed. “What was that for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands on her hips, mimicking outrage. “Isn\u0027t it about time for the wedding night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed, and not a moment too soon.” He looked around. Gregor was standing up, calling attention to himself. “We just need to get all of them to leave,” Cormac added in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac\u0027s older brother was shouting for a toast, and Marjorie led her husband closer to the fire to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are those of us who never thought we\u0027d see this day. This MacAlpin devil wed.” Gregor was as confident and dashing as ever. The sun was at his back, and it picked golden strands in his light brown hair. Turning to Cormac and Marjorie, he raised his cup. “To my little brother. And to Marjorie, the angel who came between the devil and the deep blue sea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac lifted her chin and pressed the sweetest kiss to her, a kiss holding the promise of forever. Joyful tears stung her eyes as she realized that even the wildest of dreams could come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthor\u0027s Note\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears ago, I stumbled across a mention of chimney sweeps and learned of the dreadful fates suffered by many of these “climbing boys.” Children who\u0027d grown too big would often die, trapped in the narrow passages. Others were simply stolen, transported to faraway lands where they became forced laborers. Some people argued that working in the fresh air and fields was healthier for them anyhow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis stuck in my craw for years and was the kernel from which this latest series grew. I wondered what would become of a child stolen from his homeland. Who would he be as a man? What of his family? Interestingly, it was the brother, Cormac, who was the first character in my mind. The rest barreled quickly on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those of you familiar with my first books, this latest series is a departure for me. Though I will always be as careful as possible with history and fact, here I deal in broader strokes: I don\u0027t re-create specific events, and my characters are not based on real figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the clan I chose can be read as more emblematic than literal. By the fourteenth century, Clan MacAlpin had become a “broken clan.” Even so, they are iconic. Once the kings of Scotland, MacAlpin is an ancient clan, seen today as more a meta-clan, rife with legend. Inextricably linked to Scotland and to nature, the name MacAlpin shares a root with Alba, the old word for Scotland, and also with the word alpine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat the MacAlpins are both utterly Scottish and yet not associated with events of my chosen era gave me the freedom to explore a story more purely about family in a small corner of Scotland — here, a story of lovers and brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how about that castle? If you\u0027ve traveled to Aberdeen, you\u0027re likely familiar with Dunnottar, a spectacular sight on the northeastern coast. Interestingly, it was, in fact, linked to the ancient MacAlpin kings. But from there, it\u0027s pure fiction, folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough some of my claims were true — Dunnottar was largely destroyed in sieges in the early 1650s — it was still used as a prison and fortress throughout the seventeenth century and didn\u0027t fall into ruin until the early eighteenth, well after my story takes place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will surely outrage a lot of purists out there, and considered changing Dunnottar\u0027s name, but I wanted you to envision with me just the sort of spectacular Scottish ruin I\u0027d pictured for my family. Dodie Smith\u0027s I Capture the Castle has always stayed with me, and you\u0027re seeing its faint echoes here with my MacAlpins. They are my version of a family of personalities who\u0027ve installed themselves in a tumbledown fortress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I hope you enjoyed the beginning of their story, because there sure are a lot more MacAlpins waiting in the wings. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-52.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
