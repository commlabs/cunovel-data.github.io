Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... what did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in the lobby of her dorm, leaning over one of my boots and adjusting it. Jerking my head up, I peered at her through the tangle of dark hair covering half my face. I\u0027d fallen asleep after school and had skipped using a hairbrush in order to make it out the door on time. Lissa\u0027s platinum blond hair was smooth and perfect, of course, hanging over her shoulders like a bridal veil as she watched me with amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said that I think my pills might not be working as well anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened up and shook the hair out of my face. \"What does that mean?\" I asked. Around us, Moroi hurried past, on their way to meet friends or go to dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you started ...\" I lowered my voice. \"Have you started getting your powers back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, and I saw a small flash of regret in her eyes. \"No ... I feel closer to the magic, but I still can\u0027t use it. Mostly what I\u0027m noticing lately is a little of the other stuff, you know...I\u0027m getting more depressed now and then. Nothing even close to what it used to be,\" she added hastily, seeing my face. Before she\u0027d gone on her pills, Lissa\u0027s moods could get so low that she cut herself. \"It\u0027s just there a little more than it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the other things you used to get? Anxiety? Delusional thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa laughed, not taking any of this as seriously as I was. \"You sound like you\u0027ve been reading psychiatry textbooks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually had been reading them. \"I\u0027m just worried about you. If you think the pills aren\u0027t working anymore, we need to tell someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" she said hastily. \"I\u0027m fine, really. They\u0027re still working...just not quite as much. I don\u0027t think we should panic yet. Especially you¡ªnot today, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer change in subject worked. I\u0027d found out an hour ago that I would be taking my Qualifier today. It was an exam¡ªor rather, an interview¡ªall novice guardians were required to pass during junior year at St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy. Since I\u0027d been off hiding Lissa last year, I\u0027d missed mine. Today I was being taken to a guardian somewhere off-campus who would administer the test to me. Thanks for the notice, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about me,\" Lissa repeated, smiling. \"I\u0027ll let you know if it gets worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust to be safe, though, I opened my senses and allowed myself to truly feel her through our psychic bond. She had been telling the truth. She was calm and happy this morning, nothing to worry about. But, far back in her mind, I sensed a knot of dark, uneasy feelings. It wasn\u0027t consuming her or anything, but it had the same feel as the bouts of depression and anger she used to get. It was only a trickle, but I didn\u0027t like it. I didn\u0027t want it there at all. I tried pushing farther inside her to get a better feel for the emotions and suddenly had the weird experience of touching. A sickening sort of feeling seized me, and I jerked out of her head. A small shudder ran through my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Lissa asked, frowning. \"You look nauseous all of a sudden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just...nervous for the test,\" I lied. Hesitantly, I reached out through the bond again. The darkness had completely disappeared. No trace. Maybe there was nothing wrong with her pills after all. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed at a clock. \"You won\u0027t be if you don\u0027t get moving soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it,\" I swore. She was right. I gave her a quick hug. \"See you later!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck!\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried off across campus and found my mentor, Dimitri Belikov, waiting beside a Honda Pilot. How boring. I supposed I couldn\u0027t have expected us to navigate Montana mountain roads in a Porsche, but it would have been nice to have something cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" I said, seeing his face. \"Sorry I\u0027m late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered then that I had one of the most important tests of my life coming up, and suddenly, I forgot all about Lissa and her pills possibly not working. I wanted to protect her, but that wouldn\u0027t mean much if I couldn\u0027t pass high school and actually become her guardian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri stood there, looking as gorgeous as ever. The massive, brick building cast long shadows over us, looming like some great beast in the dusky predawn light. Around us, snow was just beginning to fall. I watched the light, crystalline flakes drift gently down. Several landed and promptly melted in his dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else is going?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Just you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mood promptly shot up past \"cheerful\" and went straight to \"ecstatic.\" Me and Dimitri. Alone. In a car. This might very well be worth a surprise test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How far away is it?\" Silently, I begged for it to be a really long drive. Like, one that would take a week. And would involve us staying overnight in luxury hotels. Maybe we\u0027d get stranded in a snowbank, and only body heat would keep us alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit less than I\u0027d hoped for. Still, five hours was better than nothing. It didn\u0027t rule out the snowbank possibility, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dim, snowy roads would have been difficult for humans to navigate, but they proved no problem for our dhampir eyes. I stared ahead, trying not to think about how Dimitri\u0027s aftershave filled the car with a clean, sharp scent that made me want to melt. Instead, I tried to focus on the Qualifier again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the kind of thing you could study for. You either passed it or you didn\u0027t. High-up guardians visited novices during their junior year and met individually to discuss students\u0027 commitment to being guardians. I didn\u0027t know exactly what was asked, but rumors had trickled down over the years. The older guardians assessed character and dedication, and some novices had been deemed unfit to continue down the guardian path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t they usually come to the Academy?\" I asked Dimitri. \"I mean, I\u0027m all for the field trip, but why are we going to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, you\u0027re just going to a him, not a them.\" A light Russian accent laced Dimitri\u0027s words, the only indication of where he\u0027d grown up. Otherwise, I was pretty sure he spoke English better than I did. \"Since this is a special case and he\u0027s doing us the favor, we\u0027re the ones making the trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur Schoenberg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my gaze from the road to Dimitri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur Schoenberg was a legend. He was one of the greatest Strigoi slayers in living guardian history and used to be the head of the Guardians Council¡ªthe group of people who assigned guardians to Moroi and made decisions for all of us. He\u0027d eventually retired and gone back to protecting one of the royal families, the Badicas. Even retired, I knew he was still lethal. His exploits were part of my curriculum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t... wasn\u0027t there anyone else available?\" I asked in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see Dimitri hiding a smile. \"You\u0027ll be fine. Besides, if Art approves of you, that\u0027s a great recommendation to have on your record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArt. Dimitri was on a first-name basis with one of the most badass guardians around. Of course, Dimitri was pretty badass himself, so I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell in the car. I bit my lip, suddenly wondering if I\u0027d be able to meet Arthur Schoenberg\u0027s standards. My grades were good, but things like running away and getting into fights at school might cast a shadow on how serious I was about my future career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be fine,\" Dimitri repeated. \"The good in your record outweighs the bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like he could read my mind sometimes. I smiled a little and dared to peek at him. It was a mistake. A long, lean body, obvious even while sitting. Bottomless dark eyes. Shoulder-length brown hair tied back at his neck. That hair felt like silk. I knew because I\u0027d run my fingers through it when Victor Dashkov had ensnared us with the lust charm. With great restraint, I forced myself to start breathing again and look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Coach,\" I teased, snuggling back into the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to help,\" he replied. His voice was light and relaxed¡ªrare for him. He was usually wound up tightly, ready for any attack. Probably he figured he was safe inside a Honda¡ªor at least as safe as he could be around me. I wasn\u0027t the only one who had trouble ignoring the romantic tension between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what would really help?\" I asked, not meeting his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you turned off this crap music and put on something that came out after the Berlin Wall went down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri laughed. \"Your worst class is history, yet somehow, you know everything about Eastern Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, gotta have material for my jokes, Comrade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill smiling, he turned the radio dial. To a country station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! This isn\u0027t what I had in mind,\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell he was on the verge of laughing again. \"Pick. It\u0027s one or the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Go back to the 1980¡¯s stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped the dial, and I crossed my arms over my chest as some vaguely European-sounding band sang about how video had killed the radio star. I wished someone would kill this radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, five hours didn\u0027t seem as short as I\u0027d thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur and the family he protected lived in a small town along I-90, not far from Billings. The general Moroi opinion was split on places to live. Some argued that big cities were the best since they allowed vampires to be lost in the crowds; nocturnal activities didn\u0027t raise so much attention. Other Moroi, like this family, apparently, opted for less populated towns, believing that if there were fewer people to notice you, then you were less likely to be noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d convinced Dimitri to stop for food at a twenty-four-hour diner along the way, and between that and stopping to buy gas, it was around noon when we arrived. The house was built in a rambler style, all one level with gray-stained wood siding and big bay windows¡ªtinted to block sunlight, of course. It looked new and expensive, and even out in the middle of nowhere, it was about what I\u0027d expected for members of a royal family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped down from the Pilot, my boots sinking through an inch of smooth snow and crunching on the gravel of the driveway. The day was still and silent, save for the occasional breath of wind. Dimitri and I walked up to the house, following a river rock sidewalk that cut through the front yard. I could see him sliding into his business mode, but his overall attitude was as cheery as mine. We\u0027d both taken a kind of guilty satisfaction in the pleasant car ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy foot slipped on the ice-covered sidewalk, and Dimitri instantly reached out to steady me. I had a weird moment of d¨¦j¨¤ vu, flashing back to the first night we\u0027d met, back when he\u0027d also saved me from a similar fall. Freezing temperatures or not, his hand felt warm on my arm, even through the layers of down in my parka coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" He released his hold, to my dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, casting accusing eyes at the icy sidewalk. \"Haven\u0027t these people ever heard of salt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meant it jokingly, but Dimitri suddenly stopped walking. I instantly came to a halt too. His expression became tense and alert. He turned his head, eyes searching the broad, white plains surrounding us before settling back on the house. I wanted to ask questions, but something in his posture told me to stay silent. He studied the building for almost a full minute, looked down at the icy sidewalk, then glanced back at the driveway, covered in a sheet of snow broken only by our footprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautiously, he approached the front door, and I followed. He stopped again, this time to study the door. It wasn\u0027t open, but it wasn\u0027t entirely shut either. It looked like it had been closed in haste, not sealing. Further examination showed scuffs along the door\u0027s edge, as though it had been forced at some point. The slightest nudge would open it. Dimitri lightly ran his fingers along where the door met its frame, his breath making small clouds in the air. When he touched the door\u0027s handle it jiggled a little, like it had been broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he said quietly, \"Rose, go wait in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But wh¡ª\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne word¡ªbut one filled with power. In that single syllable I was reminded of the man I\u0027d seen throw people around and stake a Strigoi. I backed up, walking on the snow-covered lawn rather than risk the sidewalk. Dimitri stood where he was, not moving until I\u0027d slipped back into the car, closing the door as softly as possible. Then, with the gentlest of movements, he pushed on the barely held door and disappeared inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurning with curiosity, I counted to ten and then climbed out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew better than to go in after him, but I had to know what was going on with this house. The neglected sidewalk and driveway indicated that no one had been home for a couple days, although it could also mean the Badicas simply never left the house. It was possible, I supposed, that they\u0027d been the victims of an ordinary break-in by humans. It was also possible that something had scared them off¡ªsay, like Strigoi. I knew that possibility was what had made Dimitri\u0027s face turn so grim, but it seemed an unlikely scenario with Arthur Schoenberg on duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on the driveway, I glanced up at the sky. The light was bleak and watery, but it was there. Noon. The sun\u0027s highest point today. Strigoi couldn\u0027t be out in sunlight. I didn\u0027t need to fear them, only Dimitri\u0027s anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI circled around the right side of the house, walking in much deeper snow¡ªalmost a foot of it. Nothing else weird about the house struck me. Icicles hung from the eaves, and the tinted windows revealed no secrets. My foot suddenly hit something, and I looked down. There, half-buried in the snow, was a silver stake. It had been driven into the ground. I picked it up and brushed off the snow, frowning. What was a stake doing out here? Silver stakes were valuable. They were a guardian\u0027s most deadly weapon, capable of killing a Strigoi with a single strike through the heart. When they were forged, four Moroi charmed them with magic from each of the four elements. I hadn\u0027t learned to use one yet, but gripping it in my hand, I suddenly felt safer as I continued my survey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large patio door led from the back of the house to a wooden deck that probably would have been a lot of fun to hang out on in the summer. But the patio\u0027s glass had been broken, so much so that a person could easily get through the jagged hole. I crept up the deck steps, careful of the ice, knowing I was going to get in major trouble when Dimitri found out what I was doing. In spite of the cold, sweat poured down my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaylight, daylight, I reminded myself. Nothing to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached the patio and studied the dark glass. I couldn\u0027t tell what had broken it. Just inside, snow had blown in and made a small drift on pale blue carpet. I tugged on the door\u0027s handle, but it was locked. Not that that mattered with a hole that big. Careful of the sharp edges, I reached through the opening and unlocked the handle\u0027s latch from the inside. I removed my hand just as carefully and pulled open the sliding door. It hissed slightly along its tracks, a quiet sound that nonetheless seemed too loud in the eerie silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped through the doorway, standing in the patch of sunlight that had been cast inside by opening the door. My eyes adjusted from the sun to the dimness within. Wind swirled through the open patio, dancing with the curtains around me. I was in a living room. It had all the ordinary items one might expect. Couches. TV. A rocking chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a woman. She lay on her back in front of the TV, her dark hair spilling on the floor around her. Her wide eyes stared upward blankly, her face pale¡ªtoo pale even for a Moroi. For a moment I thought her long hair was covering her neck, too, until I realized that the darkness across her skin was blood¡ªdried blood. Her throat had been ripped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horrible scene was so surreal that I didn\u0027t even realize what I was seeing at first. With her posture, the woman might very well have been sleeping. Then I took in the other body: a man on his side only a couple feet away, dark blood staining the carpet around him. Another body was slumped beside the couch: small, child-size. Across the room was another. And another. There were bodies everywhere, bodies and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scale of the death around me suddenly registered, and my heart began pounding. No, no. It wasn\u0027t possible. It was day. Bad things couldn\u0027t happen in daylight. A scream started to rise in my throat, suddenly halted when a gloved hand came from behind me and closed over my mouth. I started to struggle; then I smelled Dimitri\u0027s aftershave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why,\" he asked, \"don\u0027t you ever listen? You\u0027d be dead if they were still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t answer, both because of the hand and my own shock. I\u0027d seen someone die once, but I\u0027d never seen death of this magnitude. After almost a minute, Dimitri finally removed his hand, but he stayed close behind me. I didn\u0027t want to look anymore, but I seemed unable to drag my eyes away from the scene before me. Bodies everywhere. Bodies and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I turned toward him. \"It\u0027s daytime,\" I whispered. \"Bad things don\u0027t happen in the day.\" I heard the desperation in my voice, a little girl\u0027s plea that someone would say this was all a bad dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad things can happen anytime,\" he told me. \"And this didn\u0027t happen during the day. This probably happened a couple of nights ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dared a peek back at the bodies and felt my stomach twist. Two days. Two days to be dead, to have your existence snuffed out¡ªwithout anyone in the world even knowing you were gone. My eyes fell on a man\u0027s body near the room\u0027s entrance to a hallway. He was tall, too well-built to be a Moroi. Dimitri must have noticed where I looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur Schoenberg,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Arthur\u0027s bloody throat. \"He\u0027s dead,\" I said, as though it wasn\u0027t perfectly obvious. \"How can he be dead? How could a Strigoi kill Arthur Schoenberg?\" It didn\u0027t seem possible. You couldn\u0027t kill a legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri didn\u0027t answer. Instead his hand moved down and closed around where my own hand held the stake. I flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get this?\" he asked. I loosened my grip and let him take the stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outside. In the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up the stake, studying its surface as it shone in the sunlight. \"It broke the ward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind, still stunned, took a moment to process what he\u0027d said. Then I got it. Wards were magic rings cast by Moroi. Like the stakes, they were made using magic from all four of the elements. They required strong Moroi magic-users, often a couple for each element. The wards could block Strigoi because magic was charged with life, and the Strigoi had none. But wards faded quickly and took a lot of maintenance. Most Moroi didn\u0027t use them, but certain places kept them up. St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy was ringed with several.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been a ward here, but it had been shattered when someone drove the stake through it. Their magic conflicted with each other; the stake had won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strigoi can\u0027t touch stakes,\" I told him. I realized I was using a lot of can\u0027t and don\u0027t statements.
