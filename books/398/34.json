Just as they reached the third they heard rapid firing from the gate where Stephan had left his men. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hurry, general,\" said he, \"our men are attacked!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The column advanced at a quick-step. The gate opened and the portcullis was raised as they came in sight. Though attacked by a force thrice as great as their own, the Republicans had held their ground; the gate was still theirs. The column dashed through the gate and down the street like a wild-boar which sweeps everything before him, while Stephan\u0027s men—who were a target, with their Prussian uniforms, for the men of Pichegru\u0027s command, who did not know of his little ruse—kept close to the wall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They marched on with levelled bayonets, the small force of Prussians who had attacked the gate fleeing before them. Hoping to be relieved, they sent orderlies before them to give the alarm that the French were masters of the Haguenau gate. Shots echoed throughout the town, thanks to Bauer and his men, who were firing from the windows.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru was able to appreciate the panic better when he reached the principal square. The Prussians were running hither and thither, not knowing which way to turn. He ranged his men in order of battle, while a thousand men were sent to the upper town, where most of the Prussians had hurried. The fight raged in twenty different directions. The Prussians did not attempt to rally to a centre; the attack had been so sudden, and they were confused by the conflagration, the firing, and the ringing of the tocsin.[Pg 208] Although the force commanded by Pichegru and Macdonald was no greater than that of their adversaries, the struggle was not as prolonged as if the advantages had not all been with the French.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At midnight the Prussians had retired from the town, but Pichegru was not assured of their final retreat until two in the morning. He stationed soldiers everywhere, ordered the gates guarded with the utmost vigilance, and bade the soldiers bivouac in the streets. All the townsfolk kept open house, contributing in some way to the welfare of the soldiers, to celebrate the event. Fires were lighted in the streets, and meat was cooked upon the immense spits in vogue during the latter century. Then a procession was arranged like the ones that hail the approach of carnival times in the northern cities. The streets were illuminated, the Prussian uniforms worn by Stephan\u0027s men were given to the people to be burned in effigy, and every citizen took a soldier by the arm and invited him to the fraternal banquet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru took care not to oppose this patriotic outburst. He knew well, for his intelligence was exceptionally acute, that the real strength of France lay in consolidating the people and the army until they became one body animated by one soul. Only, fearing that the enemy might attempt some surprise, he gave orders to redouble the sentinels, and, to permit each to share in the celebration, he reduced the time of duty from two hours to one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were some twenty aristocrats in Woerth who illuminated their houses even more gayly than the others, fearing, doubtless, that they would be accused of coldness toward the government and that the day of reprisals would follow closely. Their fears were groundless, for all that they had to endure was the auto-da-fé of the Prussian uniforms, and they were invited to participate in the celebrations at the auto-da-fé tables which were spread in front of their houses. This they did gladly, only too willing to escape thus easily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 209]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru had remained in the public square with a thousand men ready to give assistance if it were needed, and later to receive orders. Seeing that the order to bivouac in the streets had served as a pretext for general merry-making, he had encouraged it, and, leaving Macdonald to command in his place, he went with Stephan toward the upper part of the town.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n About three o\u0027clock in the morning Pichegru went back to the inn, for Bauer had asked as a favor that he be allowed to lodge the general. The finest apartments in the inn had been prepared, and while Pichegru was walking about the town the staircase had been decorated with flags, wreaths, and ornamental pieces. In the dining-room a table with twenty-five covers had been laid, and the windows and doors decorated with greens and flowers, for the general and his staff.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru, as we have seen at Arbois, was perfectly indifferent to triumphal demonstrations, but this time he looked upon it as a Republican love-feast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The general was accompanied by all the high dignitaries of the town who had been the first to yield to him. At the door, as Stephan was preparing to slip away unnoticed, he caught him by the arm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stephan,\" said he, \"I have always believed in the proverb that short reckonings make long friends. Now I have a double reckoning to settle with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! that can be done easily, general. Will you grant me two requests?\" said Stephan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With pleasure.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"First I ask for an invitation to supper.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"For yourself?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! general, you know that I am only a spy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the eyes of the world; but in mine—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am myself in your eyes, and that satisfies me; let me be what I seem to the world. I care nothing for what it thinks of me, but only for my revenge.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right; and the second request?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 210]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is that you will give a toast.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To whom?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will see when you give it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But in order to make it—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here it is all written out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru was about to read it, but Stephan stopped him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Read it when you give the toast,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru put the paper in his pocket. \"And whom shall I invite?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A great citizen—Prosper Bauer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The landlord of the inn?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What has he done that is so fine?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will see when you read the toast.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you always be so mysterious?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My power lies in mystery.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know that we attack to-morrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you need any information about their position?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You must be tired.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am never tired.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do what you please; anything you do will be well done, unless you are caught.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When can I bring you my report?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Any time. If you are never tired, I at least never sleep.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Au revoir, general.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Au revoir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then turning to the group that had stood aside while he was talking with Stephan, he looked vainly around for the landlord of the Golden Lion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Charles,\" he said, \"have the goodness to find our host, citizen Bauer, and ask him for me to sup with us. Take no refusal, and accept no excuse.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charles bowed and went in search of Prosper Bauer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru went upstairs and the rest of the staff followed him. He placed the mayor on his right, the deputy-mayor at his left, and left the seat opposite him for the landlord[Pg 211] of the Golden Lion. At length Charles appeared, almost dragging the embarrassed innkeeper after him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"General,\" he said, \"I come, not at your invitation, of which I am not worthy, but at your command.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, citizen,\" said Pichegru, pointing to the empty chair, \"sit down there, and after supper we will settle that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The supper was a merry one, and they drank to victory and deliverance together. There is a strong hatred between the Alsatians and the Prussians, and during the two months that the Prussians had occupied the lines of Weissembourg the Alsatians had had cause to hate them still more. This time they hoped to be rid of them altogether. But they were to see them twenty-five years later, when the insatiable Prussian eagle, having devoured a third of the white eagle of Poland, was to tear away one of the heads of the Austrian eagle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Toward the end of the supper the general remembered his promise to Stephan. He rose, took his glass in one hand and the paper in the other. Everybody followed his example, and, in the midst of profound silence, he read:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To the great patriot and citizen, Prosper Bauer, who conceived the plan which restored the town of Woerth to France; who risked his life by receiving and sheltering the sixty men in Prussian uniform who carried the Haguenau gate; who was the first to give the signal to five hundred patriots to fire from the windows upon the enemy; and who, finally, in order to keep the Prussians in the higher part of the town and to create a diversion from the attack upon the gate, set fire to his house with his own hand. To the man who in one day risked his life and sacrificed his fortune.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here the applause forced Pichegru to stop. But as he made a sign that he wished to continue, silence fell again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was by this light, kindled by the purest patriotism and the most filial devotion, that the foreigners read upon our victorious flags, \u0027Hatred to tyrants! Nationality for the[Pg 212] people! Liberty of the world!\u0027 All honor to the great patriot and citizen, Bauer!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then, amid cheers and applause, Pichegru embraced him in the name of France. Three days later the capture of Woerth was announced in the \"Moniteur,\" and Pichegru\u0027s toast was repeated in full. It was the sole reward that the brave Bauer would consent to receive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90790.html","bookId":398,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM"}
