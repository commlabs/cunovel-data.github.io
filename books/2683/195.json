He decides something and shuffles toward a large-screen TV that\u0027s ensconced in a white-oak armoire across from the bed I\u0027m shivering in. \"But in light of what\u0027s about to happen, I think it\u0027s probably imperative that you view this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, hey, wait,\" I\u0027m saying. \"No, please, don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really think you should see this, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I\u0027m pleading, afraid. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t for you,\" he says. \"This is for someone else\u0027s benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blows confetti off the tape before slipping it into the VCR below the TV. \"We think that Bobby Hughes is getting out of hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m wrapping myself in a comforter, freezing, steam pouring from my mouth because of how cold it is in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think things need to be reduced for you,\" the director says. \"In order for you to... see things clearly.\" He pauses, checks something on the VCR\u0027s console. \"Otherwise we\u0027ll be shooting this all year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I have the energy to watch this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s short,\" the director says. \"You still have some semblance of an attention span left.
