I’m sure. I’m pretty impressive, if I say so myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian wrapped his arm around Amaliya’s waist and gazed into her frightened eyes. “It’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My grandmother...” Amaliya whispered. “My cousin...Pete...they could die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll get there soon,” Cian promised. “We’ll stop whatever Rachon is planning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian pulled Amaliya away from where Aimee began to draw a large circle using a bag of white salt. His gaze met Cassandra’s for a moment and the sardonic expression that lingered in her eyes since they met was now gone. He promised himself that once they survived whatever the night would bring he would find the right time to speak with Cassandra. His vampire nature and human nature battled within him, one side demanding her death, another thrilled at the prospect of fatherhood. As if sensing his internal war, Cassandra lightly tapped her stake and smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding Amaliya close, Cian comforted her as they waited for the witch to weave her magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamantha and Jeff crouched down, making their way through the overgrown field toward the old farmhouse and the graveyard. They had seen a car park alongside the road and then its headlights had flicked off just as the back doors opened. Jeff had hit the ground, hauling Samantha down with him, and they had waited in silence for the occupants to pass by. Curled up together, they had listened to the grass rustle around them, but never sensed the passing of the newcomers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ten minutes, they had risen and started toward the graveyard again. Lights flickered and danced in the old weedy cemetery. There were several people silhouetted against the lantern illumination. Samantha counted five people, but it was difficult to discern who they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamantha eyed Jeff and he motioned for her to remain silent. He scrounged around in his messenger bag and pulled out a small pair of binoculars. Raising them to his face, he studied the scene before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratching her arm, Samantha cursed not wearing a long sleeved shirt. The wild grass and weeds were making her skin itch. The air smelled oddly stale and the warmth of the night was uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff handed her the binoculars and gestured for her to take a peek. Lifting them, she peered at the people. A tall man in a cowboy hat and duster held Innocente and another man at gunpoint. There was no sign of Sergio. A beautiful woman and an imposing man with a bald head stood over a slim young woman with whitish hair dressed in an old-fashioned ivory dress. Samantha knew instantly who they were. Rachon was here - not in Austin - and Bianca was with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScribbling on a pad of paper, Jeff\u0027s mouth was tightened into a harsh line. Samantha poked his side to get his attention and emphatically motioned at the scene. If he couldn\u0027t understand her urging him into action, he was an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff grabbed her wildly-gesturing hands and leaned toward her. His voice was barely audible. “We need to be careful not to lose the element of surprise.” He then pointed to a copse of trees near the cemetery and pantomimed them crawling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamantha nodded her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff stroked her cheek. She ran her fingers lightly over his features and kissed him. Not needing words, they shared a moment before they both sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they crept slowly forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ethan dragged her out of the truck and ripped her purse from her hands, Innocente had promptly kicked him in the shins. He instantly shoved her off her feet and onto the hard soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” Pete protested from where he sat on the ground nursing a bloody nose. He had tried to disarm Ethan and failed miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t need this anymore. We don\u0027t want to insult our guests, do we?” Ethan threw her purse into the brush and, gripping her arm, yanked her to her feet. “Get up, lover boy. Let\u0027s not waste her time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnocente tried to wrench free, but she was no match for Ethan. He easily dragged her along behind him as he aimed his gun at Pete\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get up,” Ethan ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking a bit woozy, Pete clambered to his feet. He stood on wobbly legs as he wiped the blood from his face. “So it was all a lie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan shrugged. “A bit of a lie, a bit of truth. They are going to turn her human, strip her of her powers, and then kill her. Sorry, Pete, no happy ending for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnocente observed Bianca staring at her. Tired and angry, Innocente summoned her power. It boiled up inside of her and swirled out into the night, seeking the remnants of the dead. None answered her. She wasn\u0027t sure how they could help her, but she was desperate. Her gaze shifted from Bianca to the grave where Sergio now lay. She wasn\u0027t certain if he was even alive and her anger and frustration grew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Pete looked crushed and just as furious as she was. They were both in a terrible position and they knew it. There appeared to be little or no hope of escaping whatever the ebony-skinned woman had planned for them. The vampire stood confidently next to Bianca and the tall handsome man loomed over both of them. The female vampire’s large maroon eyes rested on Innocente, a satisfied smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan kicked Pete\u0027s ass to get him moving forward. Pete cast an angry look over one shoulder, but marched forward. Ethan shoved Innocente before him, gripping her upper arm tightly. The gun Ethan had aimed at her head was enough to keep Pete under control. Innocente knew that Pete wouldn\u0027t dare do anything if he thought they would hurt her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to say I\u0027m not disappointed at all in your services, Mr. Logan. All that I heard about you is absolutely true. You certainly do get the job done,” Rachon said, laughter in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I aim to please, ma\u0027am, especially when the wire transfer has so many zeros.” Ethan hauled Innocente over the broken wrought-iron fence. Stumbling, she fell to her hands and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could be a bit nicer to an old woman,” the big black man protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought mortals didn\u0027t matter to your kind,” Ethan answered, dragging Innocente to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn\u0027t hurt to be respectful to the elderly,” the man answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prosper is a stickler for manners,” Rachon explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Bianca gaped openly at Innocente.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnocente returned her gaze. On impulse, she silently reached out to the girl on the wings of her power. Her power allowed her to speak to the dead and technically Bianca was dead. Innocente felt a shiver of a link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca, help us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl\u0027s eyes slightly shifted toward Rachon and Prosper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re more powerful than they are. Help us, Bianca, and we\u0027ll help you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca\u0027s eyelids slightly lowered, then Innocente thought she may have given the barest of nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you have all the ingredients for your ritual now,” Ethan said. He gruffly forced Innocente to sit on a gravestone. He kicked Pete\u0027s feet out from under him and the younger man fell with a thud to the ground. “Mother\u0027s blood and lover\u0027s heart. Just call up the dead and you can claim the bones of Amaliya\u0027s creator.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won\u0027t get final payment until Amaliya is mortal, understood?” Rachon said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By tomorrow night, she\u0027ll have a pulse and you can do whatever you want with her,” Ethan said confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re evil,” Innocente spat at Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan shrugged. “I like to consider myself amoral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachon turned to take Bianca\u0027s hand. Tenderly, the woman guided Bianca toward the center of the graveyard. “Time to bring forth the dead, my little one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t do this, Innocente urged the girl. She felt her power pulsing between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca shifted her eyes again toward Innocente, confirming that she could hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachon ran her long fingers through the young woman\u0027s hair and ducked her head to gaze into her face. “Bianca, raise the graveyard. We need my master\u0027s bones. Do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, the girl lifted her eyes to regard Rachon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bianca, raise the graveyard,” Rachon urged again, her voice soft, but firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting her head toward Innocente, Bianca\u0027s eyes flashed to white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t do this, Bianca. Don\u0027t let them kill us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp me, Innocente.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnocente blinked in surprise, then relief filled her. Bianca could hear her and was crying out for help. “Please, don\u0027t make her do this!” she cried out, hoping to distract her enemies from the young woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” Ethan ordered, shaking her gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I told you to treat her with respect,” Prosper said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bianca, are you listening to me?” Rachon’s voice was taking on a sharp quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnocente, help me! the girl’s voice cried out in the old woman\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting away from Ethan\u0027s grasp, Innocente boldly stood and glared at him. “Stop touching me!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-kills-pretty-when-she-dies-2/page-44.html","bookId":2617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:51:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:51:32 PM"}
