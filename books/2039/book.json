But after her last battle, she\u0027s also become queen of the Thorn Land. It\u0027s hardly an envious life, not with her kingdom in tatters, her love life in chaos, and Eugenie eager to avoid the prophecy about her firstborn destroying mankind. And now young girls are disappearing from the Otherworld, and no one - except Eugenie - seems willing to find out why. Eugenie has spilled plenty of fey blood in her time, but this enemy is shrewd, subtle, and nursing a very personal grudge. And the men in her life aren\u0027t making things any easier. Her boyfriend Kiyo is preoccupied with his pregnant ex, and sexy fey king Dorian always poses a dangerous distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:15 PM"}
