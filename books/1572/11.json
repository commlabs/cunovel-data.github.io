She realized she was nude on the bed ... but warm ... warm. Above her there was an oval shape full of glittering crystal facets. They changed colors as she watched --green, silver, yellow, blue ... They were soothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere she knew there was something urgently demanding her attention, but it was a paradox. Her whole being told her the urgent thing could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her head to the right. There was light from somewhere, but she couldn\u0027t determine its source --a light suddenly full of yellows like remembered sunlight It illuminated an odd room --a wall lined with what appeared to be books, a low oval table cluttered with strange golden shapes: cubes, rectangular containers, a domed half-egg. There was a window with night\u0027s blue blackness pushing against it. As she watched, the window became metallic white and a face appeared there to look in at her. It was a big face, odd silvery skin with harsh angles and planes, the eyes sunken, penetrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth felt she should be frightened by that face, but she couldn\u0027t find the emotional response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face disappeared and the window became a view looking down onto a seashore, surf- battered cliffs, dripping rocks, sunlight. Again, there was night\u0027s darkness in the scene and she realized that the framed shape could not be a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of it stood a wheeled stand holding an unevenly stacked, multibanked shape like a surrealistic typewriter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA draft touched the left side of her body. It was the first cold thing she had experienced since awakening. She turned toward it, saw an oval door. It stood open, but his leaves were sinking inward to seal it. Just inside the door stood a squat figure in green leotards --the face that had peered in at her. Somewhere within her there was a reaction which said: \"This is a loathsome, bowlegged little man.\" The reaction refused to surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature\u0027s wide, thick-lipped mouth opened. He said: \"I am Kelexel.\" The voice was smooth. It went through her with a tingling sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes traversed her body and she recognized the intense maleness of the look, was surprised to find herself not repelled by it. This room was so warmly soothing, the crystal facets above her moved with such gentle beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find you very attractive,\" Kelexel said. \"I do not remember ever being attracted thus, with such magnetism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked around the place where she lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth followed him with her eyes, watched him manipulate keys on the machine atop the wheeled stand. A delicious tremor ran through her and she began to wonder what it would be like to have this strange creature, this Kelexel, as a lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistantly within her, she sensed a voice screaming: \"No! No! No!\" Slowly, the voice dimmed, grew silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelexel came to stand over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am of the Chem,\" he said. \"Does this mean anything to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No.\" Her voice was faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have not seen a person such as myself before?\" Kelexel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ... \" She remembered her last few minutes with Nev, the creatures in the doorway. And Andy. She knew there was something she should feel about Andy Thurlow, a deep and abiding emotion, but there was only a sisterly affection. Dear Andy ... such a sweet, dear person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must answer me,\" Kelexel said. There was a deep feeling of power in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw ... three ... at my house ... three who ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, the three who brought you here,\" Kelexel said. \"But before that, had you seen any of us before that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought then of the grove, Andy\u0027s description (kind, pleasant Andy) but she hadn\u0027t really seen such creatures there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelexel hesitated, glanced at the telltales of the manipulator which controlled the native female\u0027s emotions. She was telling the truth. Still, it paid to be cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it means nothing to you that I am of the Chem?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ... are the Chem?\" she asked. A part of her was aroused now to intense curiosity. The curiosity struggled up through muddy waves of distraction to sit in her awareness and stare at Kelexel. What a gnome of a creature! What a sweet little gnome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shall mean something,\" Kelexel said. \"You are very attractive to me. We Chem are kind to those who please us. You cannot go back to your friends, of course, not ever. There are compensations, however. It\u0027s considered an honor to serve the Chem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is Andy? Ruth wondered. Dear, sweet Andy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very attractive,\" Kelexel murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWondering at the force which moved him, Kelexel extended a knob-knuckled finger, touched her right breast. How resilient and lovely her skin. The finger moved gently up to the nipple, to her neck, her chin, her lips, her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your eyes are green,\" Kelexel said. \"We Chem are very fond of green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth swallowed. The caressing movement of Kelexel\u0027s finger filled her with excitement. His face dominated her vision. She reached up, touched his hand. How hard and virile the hand felt. She met the penetrating stare of his brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manipulator\u0027s instruments told Kelexel that the female was now completely subjugated to his will. The realization stirred him. He smiled, exposing square silvery teeth. \"I will have many questions for you,\" he said. \"Later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth felt herself sinking into a golden daze. Her attention was locked onto the crystal facets glittering above the bed. Kelexel\u0027s head momentarily obscured the kaleidoscopic movement, then she felt his face pressed between her breasts. The golden daze overwhelmed her with ripples and waves of terrifying ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" she whispered. \"Oh, God. Oh, God.\" How pleasant to be worshiped at such a moment, Kelexel thought. It was the most pleasure he had ever experienced from a female. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-heaven-makers/page-11.html","bookId":1572,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:29 PM"}
