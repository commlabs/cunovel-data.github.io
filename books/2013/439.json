He’ll not even look at the Emperor, until Rhulad draws closer, until the two of them begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot overconfident. Not indifferent. Not even contemptuous. No easy explanations for this Toblakai warrior. He would be within himself, entirely within himself, until it was time… to witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing would turn out right, Samar Dev knew. Not all of Karsa Orlong’s prowess, nor that ever-flooding, ever-cascading torrent that was the Toblakai’s will; nor even this host of spirits trapped in the knife she now held, and those others who trailed the Toblakai’s shadow-souls of the slain, desert godlings and ancient demons of the sands and rock-spirits that might well burst forth, enwreathing their champion god (and was he truly that? A god? She did not know) with all their power. No, none of it would matter in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill Rhulad Sengar. Kill him thrice. Kill him a dozen times. In the end he will stand, sword bloodied, and then will come lcarium, the very last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin it all again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa Orlong, reduced to a mere name among the list of the slain. Nothing more than that. For this extraordinary warrior. And this is what you whisper, Fallen One, as your holy credo. Grandness and potential and promise, they all break in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven your great champion, this terrible, tortured Tiste Edur-you see him broken again and again. You fling him back each time less than what he was, yet with ever more power in his hands. He is there, yes, for us all. The power and its broken wielder broken by his power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa Orlong sat up. ‘Someone has left,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev blinked. ‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bared his teeth. ‘lcarium. He is gone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean, gone? He’s left? To go where?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It does not matter,’ the Toblakai replied, swinging round to settle his feet on the floor. He stared across at her. ‘He knows.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Knows what, Karsa Orlong?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior stood, his smile broadening, twisting the crazed tattoos on his face. ‘That he will not be needed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karsa-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will know when, woman. You will know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnow what, damn you? ‘They wouldn’t have just let him go,’ she said. ‘So he must have taken down all the guards. Karsa, this is our last chance. To head out into the city. Leave all this-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You do not understand. The Emperor is nothing. The Emperor, Samar Dev, is not the one he wants.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho? Icarium? No-‘Karsa Orlong, what secret do you hold? What do you know about the Crippled God?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Toblakai rose. ‘It is nearly dawn,’ he said. ‘Nearly time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karsa, please-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Will you witness?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do I have to?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a moment, and then his next words shocked her to the core of her soul: ‘I need you, woman.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?’ she demanded, suddenly close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To witness. To do what needs doing when the time comes.’ He drew a deep, satisfied breath, looking away, his chest swelling until she thought his ribs would creak. ‘I live for days like these,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she did weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandness, promise, potential. Fallen One, must you so share out your pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Women always get weak once a month, don’t they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go to Hood, bastard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And quick to anger, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on her feet. Pounding a fist into his solid chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive times, six-he caught her wrist, not hard enough to hurt, but stopping those swings as if a manacle had snapped tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was, for his sake, not smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fist opened and she found herself almost physically pulled up and into his eyes-seeing them, it seemed, for the first time. Their immeasurable depth, their bright ferocity and joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa Orlong nodded. ‘Better, Samar Dev.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You patronizing shit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her arm. ‘I learn more each day about women. Because of you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You still have a lot to learn, Karsa Orlong,’ she said, turning away and wiping at her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, and that is a journey I will enjoy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I really should hate you,’ she said. ‘I’m sure most people who meet you hate you, eventually.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Toblakai snorted. ‘The Emperor will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So now I must walk with you. Now I must watch you die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom outside there came shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They have discovered the escape,’ Karsa Orlong said, collecting his sword. ‘Soon they will come for us.
