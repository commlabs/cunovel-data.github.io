Masked, well-dressed patrons, in clothing that screamed stock-exchange funds or old-money tweed and university, perused the wares, physically sampling before deciding which one, or ones, they would sponsor and escort inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Janey, you\u0027ve never told us what brought about this change of heart about attending,\" her cousin Claudia said in a light tone, no doubt trying to relax the others. \"But I\u0027ve a theory.\" She must dread that the others would back out. Raven-haired \"Naughty Claudie,\" tonight sporting a scarlet mask, lived for thrills like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do tell,\" said her sister Belinda, a heads-and-tails opposite of Claudia. Belinda was brilliant and serious-minded, here tonight for \"research,\" and not euphemistically. She planned to expose \"egregious social inequities,\" but wanted to write with authority on the subject of, well, the other side of inequity. Already, Jane could tell, Belinda was eyeing the scene in terms of reform from behind her cream-colored mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did we need a reason to come,\" asked the mysterious Madeleine Van Rowen, \"other than the fact that this is a courtesans\u0027 ball?\" Maddy was a childhood friend of Claudia\u0027s who was visiting for a few weeks. She was English by birth, but now lived in Paris - a seedy Parisian garret, if rumors were to be believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane suspected that Maddy had journeyed to London to call on an old friendship and see if she could snare Claudia\u0027s older brother, Quin. Jane was not at all perturbed by this. If Madeleine could get Quin to settle down and marry, then she deserved him and all his money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Jane genuinely liked the girl, who fit in with their set perfectly. Jane, Belinda, and Claudia were three of the Weyland Eight - eight female first cousins notorious for adventures, pranks, and general hijinks - and were the only ones born and bred in London. Like all young Londoners who had coin in their pockets, they spent their days and nights recklessly pursuing all the modern pleasures to be had in this mad city, and all the old sins still on offer, within reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane and her cousins were moneyed, but not aristocratic. They were gently bred but savvy, ladylike but jaded. Like Jane and her cousins, Maddy knew how to take care of herself and seemed perfectly at ease in the face of this risqu¨¦ masquerade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if revealing a great secret, Claudia said, \"Jane\u0027s finally going to accept that gorgeous Freddie Bidworth\u0027s proposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt flared, and Jane adjusted her emerald green mask to disguise it. \"You\u0027ve got me all figured out, Claudie.\" She and Freddie Bidworth were an item of sorts, and everyone assumed Jane would eventually marry Freddie - including him. But Jane had yet to accept the rich, handsome aristocrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she feared she never could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat conclusion was what had brought about her change of heart tonight concerning the masquerade - she needed something to get her mind off the conundrum she found herself in. At twenty-seven, Janeknew prospects like him would only become more and more scarce. And if she didn\u0027t marry Freddie, then whom? Janeknew the train was leaving the station, yet she couldn\u0027t board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d told her cousins she wavered because of Freddie\u0027s horrid mother and sister. In truth, she\u0027d hesitated because, her upstanding father excepted, she didn\u0027t trust men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last couple of years, Jane had begun to realize she\u0027d been ruined. Not socially ruined. No matter how badly the Weyland Eight behaved, they never could seem to manage that coup, since her unassuming father, a mere businessman, had an inexplicable influence with the aristocracy and powerful government figures. Invitations continued to arrive, even as the cousins shook their baffled heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, a black-haired Scot with a deep, husky voice and intense eyes had ruined Jane - though he had never touched her, never even kissed her, no matter how much she\u0027d teased and tempted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda frowned at Jane. \"You\u0027ve come to terms with Bidworth\u0027s family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I believe so,\" Jane replied carefully. \"I\u0027ve just been moving slowly with something so important.\" Slowly? Freddie had asked her the first time nearly a year ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are these wild oats we\u0027re sowing, Jane?\" Maddy asked, making Jane wonder how wild any oats would seem to a woman from the not-nice part of Paris. Sometimes on their nightly thrill-seeking adventures, Maddy had appeared...bored. \"A last hurrah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did we need a reason to come,\" Jane said wryly, repeating Maddy, \"other than the fact that this is a courtesans\u0027 ball?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, they\u0027d reached the bottleneck of the entrance, where a burly attendant with a pig mask and a shining pate accepted the steep admission price, so the subject was dropped. As the four labored to keep their skirts from being dirtied in the crush, Jane tendered a guinea apiece for everyone - mainly to pay for Maddy and not hurt her pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Maddy was attired in a lavish sapphire gown, Jane had seen the girl\u0027s trunks in Claudia\u0027s room and knew her stockings and underthings had been mended and remended. Her jewels were paste. Maddy spoke of French mansions and elegant parties, but Jane suspected she was nearly destitute. Sometimes the girl had a back against-the-wall air about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the attendant waved them through, Jane blithely crossed the threshold with the others close behind. Inside the warehouse, masses of perfumed bodies swarmed around the edges of the central dance floor, or waltzed to the jaunty music of a seven-man band. Legally, this place was termed an \"unlicensed dance hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose in the know called it \"the Hive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the outside of the Hive had been rough and unassuming, the interior was lush. The walls were silk papered, and expensive-smelling incense burned, oozing a flat layer of smoke that floated just over the heads of the crowd. Along the walls were massive murals, hanging from shiny brass chains and painted with nymphs and priapic satyrs in lurid poses. Beneath the murals were Persian rugs with pillows cast about. There, women kissed lechers and fondled them artfully through their breeches - or were fondled in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything more, Jane surmised, was taken to the rooms lining the back wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappily married Belinda murmured, \"Just look at what these women are forced to do to earn their coin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earncoin ?\" Claudia breathed, feigning ignorance. \"You mean you can...? Ah! And to think I was doing it for free!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda glared, because twenty-eight-year-old Claudia was, in fact, carrying on a torrid affair with the family\u0027s groom. \"Claudia, you might try doing itwhile married .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn exhibit, of sorts, silenced all of them - halting yet another sisterly row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen and women with shaven bodies covered in a layer of clay posed as statues, motionless even when admiring patrons cupped and weighed body parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was so worth attending,\" Claudia said with a quirked eyebrow, gaze riveted to the well-endowed and muscle-bound men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane had to agree. Nothing like naked, real live statues to distract the mind from thoughts of marriage, ticking clocks, and rumbling-voiced Scotsmen who disappeared without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir group had little time to admire the scene as the crowd, circling the warehouse like a current, pushed them along. When they passed a table where a half-naked debauchee in a fox mask served punch, they each eagerly swooped up a glass, then made for the wall to get out of the traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane drank deeply. \"Well. No one told us coverage from the waist up was optional - for both sexes,\" she observed as another half-clad woman sauntered by, breasts bouncing as she smiled flirtatiously up at her. Jane gave her a saucy wink back, as was polite. \"Otherwise,\" Jane continued dryly, \"I might have opted for a lower-cut bodice and a bigger brick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddy sniffed her glass with a discerning expression, then took a hearty drink just as Claudia raised her own and said, \"I\u0027m just glad to be at a ball with punchI don\u0027t have to spike.\" Having seen her older brother Quin doing that once and noted the raucous results, Claudia never failed to bring flasks to staid gatherings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a middle-aged rou¨¦ exposed himself to the Persian-rug women and they laughed, Belinda harrumphed. She shoved her glass at Jane so she could surreptitiously take notes, like a first-year plebeian might write up boys\u0027 school demerits. Jane shrugged, placing her own finished glass on a tray, and started on Belinda\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nearly choked on the last sips as she spied a towering man in a long black domino pushing through the crowd, clearly searching for someone. His build, his stride, the aggressive set of his lips just beneath the fluttering veil drop of his mask - everything about him reminded her of Hugh, though she knew it couldn\u0027t be him. Hugh wasn\u0027t in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if it had been him? Sooner or later, he would have to return to the city, and they would run into each other. It was possible she might seehim on the carpets, with his knees falling open and eyelids growing heavy as a woman\u0027s skilled hand rubbed him. The thought made Jane drain Belinda\u0027s cup. \"Going for more punch,\" she mumbled, suddenly longing to be away from the warm throng of bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring us back some more,\" Claudia called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A double,\" Maddy added absently. She was watching the tall man wending through the crowd as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jane made her way toward the punch table, she recognized that the restless feeling in her belly that she continually battled had grown sharply worse. Ever since she could remember, she\u0027d been plagued by an anxiety, as if she were missing something, as if she were in the wrong place with greener grass calling to her. She felt an urgency about everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, after regarding the man who was so like Hugh, and imagining Hugh being serviced by another woman, she felt anurgency for fresh air. Else she\u0027d lose her punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she had glasses in hand, she returned to the group to see if they wouldn\u0027t mind going outside -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Maddy wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I turned around and she was gone,\" Claudia said, sounding not too concerned. Maddy had a habit of slinking off whenever she felt like it. The more she did it, the more Jane realized Maddy didn\u0027t find environments like the Hive threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we start looking on the dance floor?\" Jane asked with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three began maneuvering through the crowd. Unfortunately, Maddy was short and had an uncanny way of blending in. A half an hour passed, and they still hadn\u0027t spotted her -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrill whistle rent the din; Jane\u0027s head jerked up. The band whimpered to a lull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Police!\"someone yelled just as more whistles sounded all around them. \"It\u0027s the bloody peelers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, that isn\u0027t possible,\" Jane said. These dance halls always paid off the police! Who in the devil had forgotten the \"payment for protection\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, waves of screaming people clambered toward the back entrance, jostling them. The Hive was suddenly like a bottle turned upside down with the cork pulled out. The entire building seemed to rock as people fled, colliding with Jane and her cousins until a current of bodies separated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane battled to reach them, but was only forced back. When Belinda pointed to the back door, Jane shook her head emphatically - that way out was choked with people. They would be crushed to death. She\u0027d rather get nicked and have her name printed on the page of shame in theTimes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jane lost sight of her cousins completely, she backed to the wall - stunned to find herself separated and completely alone. The wave of people continued to swell until Jane was engulfed again. Unable to find a clear spot or an empty corner, she felt the world spinning out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hands shoved against her back, sending her careening. She whirled around, swinging her reticule. She garnered a split second\u0027s worth of room but connected with nothing, and the momentum tore her reticule down and off her wrist. Gone. Her money, her makeshift weapon...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next push didn\u0027t take her by surprise, but someone else was standing on her dress hem. Jane flailed her arms, helpless to stop herself from being pitched to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once, she attempted to scramble up, but her skirts had spread out over the floor like the wings of a framed butterfly, pinned there by the stampede. Over and over, she fought to rise, but always new boots trapped her skirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane darted her hands out between ankles, yanking at the material with desperate strength, struggling to gather her dress about her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t catch her breath under the press of people. How had this night gone so wrong -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boot came straight for her head. To dodge it, she rolled toward the wall as far as she could, but then, even over the commotion, she distinctly heard the eerie ping of metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up with dread, she saw one of the hanging murals directly above her, swaying wildly. The brass chain holding it had an opened link that was straightening under the massive weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a shot, the link popped, and the chain lashed out like a whip. The mural came crashing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Davis Grey chased the dragon, he had no dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that hazy twilight of opium, the pain in his body ebbed; no longer could he see the faces of the men, women, and children he\u0027d killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChasing the dragon, Grey thought with a weary exhalation, staring at the paint chipping across the ceiling of his hidden east London loft. What an appropriate saying to describe the habit - and his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, the smoke had quelled the rage in his heart, yet finally his need for revenge had overpowered even opium\u0027s sweet pull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose in stages from his sweat-dampened bed, then crossed to the basin to splash water over his face. In the basin mirror, he studied his naked body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour crusting bullet wounds riddled his pale chest and torso, a constant reminder of the attempt on his life. Though it had been six months ago since Edward Weyland, for whom Grey had killed faithfully, had sent him to his own destruction, the wounds still hadn\u0027t healed completely. Though half a year had passed, Grey could remember perfectly the order in which he\u0027d taken each bullet from a trio of Weyland\u0027s hungry, younger killers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet somehow Grey had survived. He\u0027d lost much muscle, but he still possessed a wiry strength - enough to enact his plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran a finger down his chest, skating around the wounds in fascination. Perhaps Weyland should have sent his best man for the kill. But then Weyland always spared Hugh MacCarrick thealtering jobs, the ones that changed a man forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose tasks should have been split between Grey and Hugh, but Weyland carefully meted out each one. Hugh was dispatched to kill people who were out-and-out evil, dangerous people who often fought for the lives Hugh sought to take. Grey executed the variables, the peripherals. Toward the end, Grey hadn\u0027t been very particular if children got in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dreams, he saw their glassy, sightless eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeyland, that bloody bastard, didn\u0027t even send Hugh to kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat galled Grey more than anything, scalding him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon Grey would deliver his retribution. Weyland treasured only one thing in this world - his daughter, Jane. MacCarrick had loved her from afar for years. Take away Jane, and two men would be destroyed, forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little work had ensured that Weyland and his informants knew Grey was stirring. Cunning and two deaths had ensured that they thought Grey was still on the Continent. Weyland would already have sent for his best gunman to protect his precious daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Hugh should be there to see Grey end her life. Both MacCarrick and Weyland should know the searing purity of grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was power innate in having nothing left to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears ago, Weyland had said that Grey was suited for his occupation because he possessed no mercy, but he\u0027d been wrong then. Years ago, Grey wouldn\u0027t have been able to happily slit Jane\u0027s pretty throat. Weyland wasn\u0027t wrong now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shriek, Jane rolled out of the way just as a corner of the mural hammered into the floor directly beside her. She didn\u0027t have time to gape at how close it had been because more charging people overwhelmed her. She couldn\u0027t breathe. With a cry, she ducked her head down, raising an arm over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, Jane lowered her arm, brows drawn in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd was parting around her instead of treading over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, she had room to maneuver, a fighting chance....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d be damned if she\u0027d be killed by the very spectacle she\u0027d come to leer at! Finally able to gather her skirts, she made another wobbling attempt to rise, and lurched to her feet. Whirling around, she lunged forward.Free!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo!Brought up short, she dropped to her front with a thud. She crawled on her forearms, but realized she was crawling in place. Something still anchored her. More people coming in a rush -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle-aged rou¨¦ she\u0027d seen earlier dropped bodily to the ground beside her, holding his bleeding nose, staring up horrified at something behind them. Before she could even react, another man went flying over her, landing flat on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, her skirts were tossed up to the backs of her legs, and a hot, calloused hand clamped onto her thigh. Her eyes went wide in shock. Another hand pawed at her petticoats, ripping them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wh-what are you doing?\" she screeched, her head whipping around. With her mask askew and her hair tumbling into her face, she could barely see the man through the shadows of a jungle of legs all around them. \"Unhand me this instant!\" She jostled the leg he held firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the back of her hand, she shoved her hair away, and spied another flash of her attacker. Grim lips pulled back from white teeth as if in a snarl. Three gashes ran down his cheek, and his face was dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes held a murderous rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visage disappeared as her attacker bolted to his feet and felled another oncoming patron, before dropping down beside her once more. His fist shot up at intervals as he ripped again at her petticoats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized he\u0027d finally stopped - when he swooped her up onto his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"H-how dare you!\" she cried, pummeling his broad back. She vaguely noted that this was a bear of a man who\u0027d lifted her with the ease of plucking lint from a lapel. The body she was looped over was massive, the arm over her heavy and unyielding. His fingers were splayed, it seemed, over the entire width of her bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go this way! Put me down!\" she demanded. \"How dare you paw at me, ripping at my undergarments!\" As soon as she\u0027d said the last, she spotted the remains of her petticoats pinned beneath a mural with a jaunty satyr covering a nymph. Her face flamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his free arm, the man sent patrons careening. \"Lass, it\u0027s nothing you have no\u0027 shown me before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Her jaw dropped.Hugh MacCarrick?

And remembering how she\u0027d fared the last time the Highlander had drifted into her life, she wondered if she mightn\u0027t have been better off trampled by a drunken horde. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-2.html","bookId":2645,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 PM"}
