Leto will lead humankind through that garden for at least four thousand years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyekanik glanced questioningly at Farad\u0027n, cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Tyek?\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d speak privately with you, My Prince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n smiled, knowing the question in Tyekanik\u0027s military mind, knowing that at least two others present also recognized this question. \"I\u0027ll not sell the Sardaukar,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need,\" Ghanima said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you listen to this child?\" Tyekanik demanded. He was outraged. The old Naib there understood the problems being raised by all of this plotting, but nobody else knew a damned thing about the situation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima smiled grimly, said: \"Tell him, Farad\u0027n.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n sighed. It was easy to forget the strangeness of this child who was not a child. He could imagine a lifetime married to her, the hidden reservations on every intimacy. It was not a totally pleasant prospect, but he was beginning to recognize its inevitability. Absolute control of dwindling spice supplies! Nothing would move in the universe without the spice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later, Tyek,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later, I said!\" For the first time, he used Voice on Tyekanik, saw the man blink with surprise and remain silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tight smile touched Jessica\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He talks of peace and death in the same breath,\" Stilgar muttered. \"Golden Age!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima said: \"He\u0027ll lead humans through the cult of death into the free air of exuberant life! He speaks of death because that\u0027s necessary, Stil. It\u0027s a tension by which the living know they\u0027re alive. When his Empire falls... Oh, yes, it\u0027ll fall. You think this is Kralizec now, but Kralizec is yet to come. And when it comes, humans will have renewed their memory of what it\u0027s like to be alive. The memory will persist as long as there\u0027s a single human living. We\u0027ll go through the crucible once more, Stil. And we\u0027ll come out of it. We always arise from our own ashes. Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n, hearing her words, understood now what she\u0027d meant in telling him about Leto running. He\u0027ll not be human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar was not yet convinced. \"No more worms,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the worms will come back,\" Ghanima assured him. \"All will be dead within two hundred years, but they\u0027ll come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How... \" Stilgar broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n felt his mind awash in revelation. He knew what Ghanima would say before she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Guild will barely make it through the lean years, and only then because of its stockpiles and ours,\" Ghanima said. \"But there\u0027ll be abundance after Kralizec. The worms will return after my brother goes into the sand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with so many other religions, Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s Golden Elixir of Life degenerated into external wizardry. Its mystical signs became mere symbols for deeper psychological processes, and those processes, of course, ran wild. What they needed was a living god, and they didn\u0027t have one, a situation which Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s son has corrected. -Saying attributed to Lu Tung-pin, (Lu, The Guest of the Cavern)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto sat on the Lion Throne to accept the homage of the tribes. Ghanima stood beside him, one step down. The ceremony in the Great Hall went on for hours. Tribe after Fremen tribe passed before him through their delegates and their Naibs. Each group bore gifts fitting for a god of terrifying powers, a god of vengeance who promised them peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d cowed them into submission the previous week, performing for the assembled arifa of all the tribes. The Judges had seen him walk through a pit of fire, emerging unscathed to demonstrate that his skin bore no marks by asking them to study him closely. He\u0027d ordered them to strike him with knives, and the impenetrable skin had sealed his face while they struck at him to no avail. Acids ran off him with only the lightest mist of smoke. He\u0027d eaten their poisons and laughed at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end he\u0027d summoned a worm and stood facing them at its mouth. He\u0027d moved from that to the landing field at Arrakeen, where he\u0027d brazenly toppled a Guild frigate by lifting one of its landing fins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arifa had reported all of this with a fearful awe, and now the tribal delegates had come to seal their submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vaulted space of the Great Hall with its acoustical dampening systems tended to absorb sharp noises, but a constant rustling of moving feet insinuated itself into the senses, riding on dust and the flint odors brought in from the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica, who\u0027d refused to attend, watched from a high spy hole behind the throne. Her attention was caught by Farad\u0027n and the realization that both she and Farad\u0027n had been outmaneuvered. Of course Leto and Ghanima had anticipated the Sisterhood! The twins could consult within themselves a host of Bene Gesserits greater than all now living in the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was particularly bitter at the way the Sisterhood\u0027s mythology had trapped Alia. Fear built on fear! The habits of generations had imprinted the fate of Abomination upon her. Alia had known no hope. Of course she\u0027d succumbed. Her fate made the accomplishment of Leto and Ghanima even more difficult to face. Not one way out of the trap, but two. Ghanima\u0027s victory over the inner lives and her insistence that Alia deserved only pity were the bitterest things of all. Hypnotic suppression under stress linked to the wooing of a benign ancestor had saved Ghanima. They might have saved Alia. But without hope, nothing had been attempted until it was too late. Alia\u0027s water had been poured upon the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica sighed, shifted her attention to Leto on the throne. A giant canopic jar containing the water of Muad\u0027Dib occupied a place of honor at his right elbow. He\u0027d boasted to Jessica that his father-within laughed at this gesture even while admiring it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat jar and the boasting had firmed her resolve not to participate in this ritual. As long as she lived, she knew she could never accept Paul speaking through Leto\u0027s mouth. She rejoiced that House Atreides had survived, but the things-that-might-have-been were beyond bearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n sat cross-legged beside the jar of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s water. It was the position of the Royal Scribe, an honor newly conferred and newly accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n felt that he was adjusting nicely to these new realities although Tyekanik still raged and promised dire consequences. Tyekanik and Stilgar had formed a partnership of distrust which seemed to amuse Leto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hours of the homage ceremony, Farad\u0027n had gone from awe to boredom to awe. They were an endless stream of humanity, these peerless fighting men. Their loyalty renewed to the Atreides on the throne could not be questioned. They stood in submissive terror before him, completely daunted by what the arifa had reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last it drew to a close. The final Naib stood before Leto - Stilgar in the \"rearguard position of honor.\" Instead of panniers heavy with spice, fire jewels, or any of the other costly gifts which lay in mounds around the throne, Stilgar bore a headband of braided spice-fiber. The Atreides Hawk had been worked in gold and green into its design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima recognized it and shot a sidewise glance at Leto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar placed the headband on the second step below the throne, bowed low. \"I give you the headband worn by your sister when I took her into the desert to protect her,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto suppressed a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027ve fallen on hard times, Stilgar,\" Leto said. \"Is there something here you would have in return?\" He gestured at the piles of costly gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, My Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I accept your gift then,\" Leto said. He rocked forward, brought up the hem of Ghanima\u0027s robe, ripped a thin strip from it. \"In return, I give you this bit of Ghanima\u0027s robe, the robe she wore when she was stolen from your desert camp, forcing me to save her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar accepted the cloth in a trembling hand. \"Do you mock me, My Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mock you? By my name, Stilgar, never would I mock you. I have given you a gift without price. I command you to carry it always next to your heart as a reminder that all humans are prone to error and all leaders are human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin chuckle escaped Stilgar. \"What a Naib you would have made!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a Naib I am! Naib of Naibs. Never forget that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, My Lord.\" Stilgar swallowed, remembering the report of his arifa. And he thought: Once I thought of slaying him. Now it\u0027s too late. His glance fell on the jar, a graceful opaque gold capped with green. \"That is water of my tribe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mine,\" Leto said. \"I command you to read the inscription upon its side. Read it aloud that all may hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar cast a questioning glance at Ghanima, but she returned it with a lift of her chin, a cold response which sent a chill through him. Were these Atreides imps bent on holding him to answer for his impetuosity and his mistakes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read it,\" Leto said, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Stilgar mounted the steps, bent to look at the jar. Presently he read aloud: \"This water is the ultimate essence, a source of outward streaming creativity. Though motionless, this water is the means of all movement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it mean, My Lord?\" Stilgar whispered. He felt awed by the words, touched within himself in a place he could not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The body of Muad\u0027Dib is a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect,\" Leto said. \"He mastered the inner world while holding the outer in contempt, and this led to catastrophe. He mastered the outer world while excluding the inner world, and this delivered his descendants to the demons. The Golden Elixir will vanish from Dune, yet Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s seed goes on, and his water moves our universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar bowed his head. Mystical things always left him in turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The beginning and the end are one,\" Leto said. \"You live in air but do not see it. A phase has closed. Out of that closing grows the beginning of its opposite. Thus, we will have Kralizec. Everything returns later in changed form. You have felt thoughts in your head; your descendants will feel thoughts in their bellies. Return to Sietch Tabr, Stilgar. Gurney Halleck will join you there as my advisor in your Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you trust me, My Lord?\" Stilgar\u0027s voice was low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Completely, else I\u0027d not send Gurney to you. He\u0027ll begin recruiting the new force we\u0027ll need soon. I accept your pledge of fealty, Stilgar. You are dismissed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar bowed low, backed off the steps, turned and left the hall. The other Naibs fell into step behind him according to the Fremen principle that \"the last shall be first.\" But some of their queries could be heard on the throne as they departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you talking about up there, Stil? What does that mean, those words on Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke to Farad\u0027n. \"Did you get all of that, Scribe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, My Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandmother tells me she trained you well in the mnemonic processes of the Bene Gesserit. That\u0027s good. I don\u0027t want you scribbling beside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you command, My Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come and stand before me,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n obeyed, more than ever thankful for Jessica\u0027s training. When you accepted the fact that Leto no longer was human, no longer could think as humans thought, the course of his Golden Path became ever more frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto looked up at Farad\u0027n. The guards stood well back out of earshot. Only the counselors of the Inner Presence remained on the floor of the Great Hall, and they stood in subservient groups well beyond the first step. Ghanima had moved closer to rest an arm on the back of the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve not yet agreed to give me your Sardaukar,\" Leto said. \"But you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I owe you much, but not that,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they\u0027d not mate well with my Fremen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As well as those new friends, Stilgar and Tyekanik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I await your offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I must make the offer, knowing you will never repeat it. I pray my grandmother has done her part well, that you are prepared to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What must I understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always a prevailing mystique in any civilization,\" Leto said. \"It builds itself as a barrier against change, and that always leaves future generations unprepared for the universe\u0027s treachery. All mystiques are the same in building these barriers - the religious mystique, the hero-leader mystique, the messiah mystique, the mystique of science/technology, and the mystique of nature itself. We live in an Imperium which such a mystique has shaped, and now that Imperium is falling apart because most people don\u0027t distinguish between mystique and their universe. You see, the mystique is like demon possession; it tends to take over the consciousness, becoming all things to the observer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I recognize your grandmother\u0027s wisdom in these words,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well and good, cousin. She asked me if I were Abomination. I answered in the negative. That was my first treachery. You see, Ghanima escaped this, but I did not. I was forced to balance the inner lives under the pressure of excessive melange. I had to seek the active cooperation of those aroused lives within me. Doing this, I avoided the most malignant and chose a dominant helper thrust upon me by the inner awareness which was my father. I am not, in truth, my father or this helper. Then again, I am not the Second Leto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an admirable directness,\" Leto said. \"I\u0027m a community dominated by one who was ancient and surpassingly powerful. He fathered a dynasty which endured for three thousand of our years. His name was Harum and, until his line trailed out in the congenital weaknesses and superstitions of a descendant, his subjects lived in a rhythmic sublimity. They moved unconsciously with the changes of the seasons. They bred individuals who tended to be short-lived, superstitious, and easily led by a god-king. Taken as a whole, they were a powerful people. Their survival as a species became habit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the sound of that,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor do I, really,\" Leto said. \"But it\u0027s the universe I\u0027ll create.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lesson I learned on Dune. We kept the presence of death a dominant specter among the living here. By that presence, the dead changed the living. The people of such a society sink down into their bellies. But when the time comes for the opposite, when they arise, they are great and beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t answer my question,\" Farad\u0027n protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t trust me, cousin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor does your own grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And with good reason,\" Leto said. \"But she acquiesces because she must. Bene Gesserits are pragmatists in the end. I share their view of our universe, you know. You wear the marks of that universe. You retain the habits of rule, cataloging all around you in terms of their possible threat or value.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agreed to be your scribe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It amused you and flattered, your real talent, which is that of historian. You\u0027ve a definite genius for reading the present in terms of the past. You\u0027ve anticipated me on several occasions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like your veiled insinuations,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. You come from infinite ambition to your present lowered estate. Didn\u0027t my grandmother warn you about infinity? It attracts us like a floodlight in the night, blinding us to the excesses it can inflict upon the finite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bene Gesserit aphorisms!\" Farad\u0027n protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But much more precise,\" Leto said. \"The Bene Gesserit believed they could predict the course of evolution. But they overlooked their own changes in the course of that evolution. They assumed they would stand still while their breeding plan evolved. I have no such reflexive blindness. Look carefully at me, Farad\u0027n, for I am no longer human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your sister assures me.\" Farad\u0027n hesitated. Then: \"Abomination?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the Sisterhood\u0027s definition, perhaps. Harum is cruel and autocratic. I partake of his cruelty. Mark me well: I have the cruelty of the husbandman, and this human universe is my farm. Fremen once kept tame eagles as pets, but I\u0027ll keep a tame Farad\u0027n.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n\u0027s face darkened. \"Beware my claws, cousin. I well know my Sardaukar would fall in time before your Fremen. But we\u0027d wound you sorely, and there are jackals waiting to pick off the weak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will use you well, that I promise,\" Leto said. He leaned forward. \"Did I not say I\u0027m no longer human? Believe me, cousin. No children will spring from my loins, for I no longer have loins. And this forces my second treachery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n waited in silence, seeing at last the direction of Leto\u0027s argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall go against every Fremen precept,\" Leto said. \"They will accept because they can do nothing else. I kept you here under the lure of a betrothal, but there will be no betrothal of you and Ghanima. My sister will marry me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marry, I said. Ghanima must continue the Atreides line. There\u0027s also the matter of the Bene Gesserit breeding program, which is now my breeding program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I refuse,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You refuse to father an Atreides dynasty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What dynasty? You\u0027ll occupy the throne for thousands of years,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mold your descendants in my image. It will be the most intensive, the most inclusive training program in all of history. We\u0027ll be an ecosystem in miniature. You see, whatever system animals choose to survive by must be based on the pattern of interlocking communities, interdependence, working together in the common design which is the system. And this system will produce the most knowledgeable rulers ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You put fancy words on a most distasteful -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who will survive Kralizec?\" Leto asked. \"I promise you, Kralizec will come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a madman! You will shatter the Empire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I will... and I\u0027m not a man. But I\u0027ll create a new consciousness in all men. I tell you that below the desert of Dune there\u0027s a secret place with the greatest treasure of all time. I do not lie. When the last worm dies and the last melange is harvested upon our sands, these deep treasures will spring up throughout our universe. As the power of the spice monopoly fades and the hidden stockpiles make their mark, new powers will appear throughout our realm. It is time humans learned once more to live in their instincts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima took her arm from the back of the throne, crossed to Farad\u0027n\u0027s side, took his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As my mother was not wife, you will not be husband,\" Leto said. \"But perhaps there will be love, and that will be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Each day, each moment brings its change,\" Ghanima said. \"One learns by recognizing the moments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n felt the warmth of Ghanima\u0027s tiny hand as an insistent presence. He recognized the ebb and flow of Leto\u0027s arguments, but not once had Voice been used. It was an appeal to the guts, not to the mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this what you offer for my Sardaukar?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much, much more, cousin. I offer your descendants the Imperium. I offer you peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will be the outcome of your peace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s opposite,\" Leto said, his voice calmly mocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n shook his head. \"I find the price for my Sardaukar very high. Must I remain Scribe, the secret father of your royal line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you try to force me into your habit of peace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll resist you every day of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s the function I expect of you, cousin. It\u0027s why I chose you. I\u0027ll make it official. I will give you a new name. From this moment, you\u0027ll be called Breaking of the Habit, which in our tongue is Harq al-Ada. Come, cousin, don\u0027t be obtuse. My mother taught you well. Give me your Sardaukar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give them,\" Ghanima echoed. \"He\u0027ll have them one way or another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n heard fear for himself in her voice. Love, then? Leto asked not for reason, but for an intuitive leap. \"Take them,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" Leto said. He lifted himself from the throne, a curiously fluid motion as though he kept his terrible powers under most delicate control. Leto stepped down then to Ghanima\u0027s level, moved her gently until she faced away from him, turned and placed his back against hers. \"Note this, cousin Harq al-Ada. This is the way it will always be with us. We\u0027ll stand thus when we are married. Back to back, each looking outward from the other to protect the one thing which we have always been.\" He turned, looked mockingly at Farad\u0027n, lowered his voice: \"Remember that, cousin, when you\u0027re face to face with my Ghanima. Remember that when you whisper of love and soft things, when you are most tempted by the habits of my peace and my contentment. Your back will remain exposed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning from them, he strode down the steps into the waiting courtiers, picked them up in his wake like satellites, and left the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima once more took Farad\u0027n\u0027s hand, but her gaze looked beyond the far end of the hall long after Leto had left it. \"One of us had to accept the agony,\" she said, \"and he was always the stronger.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-33.html","bookId":2155,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM"}
