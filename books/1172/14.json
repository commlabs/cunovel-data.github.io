{"id":24516,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV THE MAN WITH THE RING","content":"Toward morning a tramping of feet aroused me; the door was thrust open long enough for another prisoner to be admitted, and then I heard the bolts shoot into their fastening and the soldiers march away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was not quite dark in the room, for the shutters were open and admitted a ray of moonlight through the window. So I lay still and strained my eyes to discover who my companion might be.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood motionless for a time in the place the soldiers had left him. I made out that he was tall and stooping, and exceedingly thin; but his face was in shadow. Presently, as he moved, I heard a chain clank, and knew he was hand-cuffed in the same manner as myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Slowly he turned his body, peering into every corner of the room, so that soon he discovered me lying where the moonlight 163was strongest. He gave a start, then, but spoke no word; and again an interval of absolute silence ensued.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His strange behavior began to render me uneasy. It is well to know something of a person confined with you in a small room at the dead of night, and I was about to address the fellow when he began stealthily approaching the bed. He might have been three yards distant when I arose to a sitting posture. This caused him to pause, his form well within the streak of light. Resting upon the edge of the bed and facing him, my own features were clearly disclosed, and we examined each other curiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I had never seen him before, and I had little pleasure in meeting him then. He appeared to be a man at least fifty years of age, with pallid, sunken cheeks, eyes bright, but shifting in their gaze, and scanty gray locks that now hung disordered over a low forehead. His form was thin and angular, his clothing of mean quality, and his hands, which dangled before him at the ends of the short chain, were large and hardened by toil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 164Not a Brazilian, I decided at once; but I could not then determine his probable nationality.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Likewise a prisoner, se?or?” he inquired, in an indistinct, mumbling tone, and with a strong accent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” I answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ah, conspirator. I see; I see!” He nodded his head several times, and then growled sentences that I could not understand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While I stared at him he turned away again, and with a soft and stealthy tread made the entire circuit of the room, feeling of each piece of furniture it contained, and often pausing for many moments in one spot as if occupied in deep thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last he approached the bed again, dragging after him a chair in which he slowly seated himself opposite me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Retain your couch, se?or,” he muttered. “I shall not disturb you, and it will soon be morning. You may sleep.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But I was now fully awake, and had no intention of sleeping while this strange individual occupied his seat beside me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 165“Who are you?” I demanded. “A patriot?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not as you use the term,” he answered, at once. “I am Mexican.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mexican!” I echoed, surprised. “Do you speak English?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Truly, se?or,” he answered, but his English was as bad as his Portuguese.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why are you here and a prisoner?” I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I had business with Se?or de Pintra. I came from afar to see him, but found the soldiers inhabiting his house. I am timid, se?or, and suspecting trouble I hid in an out-building, where the soldiers discovered me. Why I should be arrested I do not know. I am not conspirator; I am not even Brazilian. I do not care for your politics whatever. They tell me Miguel de Pintra is dead. Is it true?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His tone did not seem sincere. But I replied it was true that Dom Miguel was dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then I should be allowed to depart. But not so. They tell me the great Emperor is here, their Dom Pedro, and he will speak to me in the morning. Is it true?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 166This time I detected an anxiety in his voice that told me he had not suspected the Emperor’s presence until his arrest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But I answered that Dom Pedro was then occupying de Pintra’s mansion, together with many of his important ministers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a time he remained silent, probably considering the matter with care. But he was ill at ease, and shifted continually in his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are Americano?” he asked at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said I.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I knew, when you ask me for my English. But why does the Emperor arrest an American?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I smiled; but there was no object in trying to deceive him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I was private secretary to Dom Miguel,” said I, “and they suspect my late master to have plotted against the Emperor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He laughed, unpleasantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is well your master is dead when they make that suspicion,” said he; then paused a moment and asked, abruptly, “Did he tell you of the vault?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I stared at him. A Mexican, not a conspirator, 167yet aware of the secret vault! It occurred to me that it would be well to keep my own counsel, for a time, at least.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A vault?” I asked, carelessly, and shook my head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again the fellow laughed disagreeably. But my answer seemed to have pleased him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He was sly! Ah, he was sly, the dear Se?or Miguel!” he chuckled, rocking his thin form back and forth upon the chair. “But never mind. It is nothing. I never pry into secrets, se?or. It is not my nature.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I said nothing and another silent fit seized him. Perhaps five minutes had passed before he arose and made a second stealthy circuit of the room, this time examining the barred window with great care. Then he sighed heavily and came back to his seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What will be your fate, se?or?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall appeal to our consul at Rio. They must release me,” I answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good. Very good! They must release you. You are no conspirator—a mere secretary, and an American.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I nodded, wishing I might share his confidence. 168Presently he asked for my name and residence, and I answered him truly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I myself am Manuel Pesta, of the City of Mexico. You must not forget the name, se?or. Manuel Pesta, the clockmaker.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall not forget,” said I, wondering what he could mean. And a moment later he startled me by bending forward and asking in an eager tone:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have they searched you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is my turn soon. This morning.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and fell silent again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For my part I lay back upon the pillow, yet taking care to face him, and so we remained until daylight came and gradually drove the shadows from the little room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even then my strange companion did not move. He was indeed a queer mixture of eager activity and absolute self-repression. Another hour passed, and then we heard footsteps approaching down the passageway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a start Pesta aroused himself and fixed a searching glance upon my face. Trembling with nervousness he suddenly raised his manacled hands and removed 169from his mouth a small object that glittered in the morning light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My heart gave a sudden bound. It was the ring that opened the secret vault!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His own agitation prevented his noting my amazement. Thrusting the ring toward me he whispered, hurriedly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Conceal it, quickly, for the love of God! Keep it until I come for it—I, Manuel Pesta—until I demand it of Robert Harcliffe of New Orleans. It may be to-day—it may be many days. But I will come, se?or, I—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bolts of the door shot back and a squad of soldiers entered. Their sudden appearance barely gave me time to drop the ring into an outside pocket of my coat. As two of the soldiers seized him I noticed that the Mexican was trembling violently; but he arose meekly and submitted to be led from the room. Two others motioned me to follow, and in a few moments we were ushered into the room where I had had my interview with the Emperor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Valcour was standing by the fireplace when we entered, and eyeing the Mexican with indifference he said to the captain:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 170“This is the man you found secreted in the out-building?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is, senhor,” answered the captain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you searched him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Only partially. We took from him this revolver, a knife, and this purse. There were no papers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Valcour took the weapons in his hands and examined them. The revolver, I could see as he threw back the barrel, was loaded in all six chambers. The knife he glanced at and turned to place upon the mantel when a second thought seemingly induced him to open the blades. It was a large, two-bladed affair, and the bright steel showed that it was sharpened as finely as a razor. As I watched the Emperor’s spy I chanced to look toward the Mexican and surprised an expression that nearly resembled terror upon his haggard face. Perhaps Valcour saw it, too, for he drew a handkerchief from his pocket and carefully wiped out the seats in the handles where the blades lay when the knife was closed. A small stain appeared upon the linen, and the spy carried the handkerchief to the window and inspected the 171stain with interest. While he was thus engaged the Emperor entered the room, followed by his ministers, and seating himself at the table calmly proceeded to light a cigar. Evidently he had just breakfasted, for he had an appearance of content that indicated a comfortable condition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Valcour, returning from the window, first saluted the Emperor with great deference, and then addressed the Mexican.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why did you kill that man last evening and sever his hand with your knife?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Mexican gazed at him in horror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I—se?or, as God hears me, I—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Tell me why!” said Valcour calmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fellow glared at him as if fascinated. Then he threw his hands, all manacled as they were, high above his head, and with a scream that caused even the Emperor to start, fell upon the floor in a swoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Valcour turned him over with his foot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Search him!” he commanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The men were thorough. Not a shred of clothing escaped their eyes. And after they had finished the detective himself made an examination.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 172Dom Pedro was evidently much interested. Without any explanation further than Valcour’s accusation, all present understood that the Mexican was charged with the murder of the man found in the shrubbery and therefore he must either have the ring upon his person or had deposited it in some secret place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He lay unconscious after the search had ended, and Valcour, after a moment’s reflection, ordered the men to carry him back to the room where he had passed the night, to guard him well, and to send for a physician.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Emperor relighted his cigar, which had gone out, and in the interval I heard the sound of a troupe of horse galloping up the drive. There was no mistaking the clank of sabers, and Dom Pedro leaned forward with an expectant look upon his face, in which the others joined.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the door burst open and a man entered and knelt before the Emperor. I could scarcely restrain a cry of surprise as I saw him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was Francisco Paola.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1680/49521.html","bookId":1172,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:12:19 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:12:19 PM"}
