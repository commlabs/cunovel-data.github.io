But he couldn’t walk away. Between himself and Syre, he was the lesser of two evils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’ve got a death wish,” Adrian said, as thunder rumbled across the sky, “pay me a visit. I’m happy to assist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay frowned at something, and he followed her gaze. The woman with the antsy kids was still fighting with the elder. The boy’s voice rose to a volume that drew attention from everyone in the immediate area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire leader laughed. “Not until I’m certain my daughter is free of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your death will take care of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian would forever curse the weakness that had driven him to Syre when Shadoe was fatally wounded. He’d mistakenly believed the Fallen leader’s love for his child would ensure he would act in her best interests, but Syre’s thirst for vengeance was as all-consuming as his thirst for blood. He would do anything to prevent his daughter from bringing happiness to the Sentinel who’d punished him. He’d attempted to turn her into a vampire like himself—a soulless, bloodsucking creature who would have to live in darkness for eternity—rather than allow her to love Adrian with her mortal soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Adrian had realized Syre’s intent, he’d stopped the Change, with unforeseen consequences—her body had died, but her naphil soul had been immortalized. The partial Change had caused Shadoe to return again and again in an endless cycle of reincarnation, because, unlike a mortal, her soul was half angelic but independent of wings. Mortal souls died with the Change and angel souls died with the loss of their wings, but the nephalim had neither vulnerability. When Shadoe’s body had been prevented from completing the transformation, her naphil soul survived to remain tied to the individual who’d sired her into vampirism. Killing her father should free her by severing Syre’s hold on her soul; only the vampire who initiated a Change could complete it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut time was Adrian’s enemy. He had only Lindsay’s uncertain life span in which to work. It was a terribly small window for an immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Selfish bastard,” the vampire hissed. “You would rather Shadoe die than live forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you would rather she suffer your punishment, even though she doesn’t deserve it. You broke the law, not her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t she, though, Adrian? She lured you to fall as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The decision was mine. Therefore the fault is mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet you don’t suffer as we do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t?” Adrian challenged softly. “How would you know what I suffer, Syre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Lindsay again. She watched him from her seat with those dark eyes that seemed to catch everything. They were far too worldly for a person of her age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows arched in silent inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe affected a reassuring smile. She was as attuned to him as he was to her, but she couldn’t recall the history between them that had created the affinity. He would have to take care not to cause her concern or distress. His mercurial emotions were a sign of how far he’d fallen. They were a testament to how human his love for her had made him. The heavens lamented his mortal weakness through the weather—raining when he mourned, thundering when he raged, the temperature fluctuating with the heat or chill of his moods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You covet her soul,” Syre purred, “because it’s the one thing that binds her to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet you won’t let me bring her into full awareness. Why is that, Adrian? What are you afraid of? That she’ll weaken you all over again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, the defiant young boy kicked his mother in the shin. She cried out. The startled baby in her arms flailed backward. Off balance and clearly beyond frustrated, the frazzled young woman lost her grip on the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian rushed forward, forcing himself to move at a natural human pace—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—but Lindsay caught the infant first. Too swiftly. So damn swiftly it seemed as if the baby had never been in danger of hitting the floor at all. The mother blinked, her open mouth betraying her confusion at finding Lindsay directly in front of her instead of seated a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget,” Syre continued, “that soul you prize is clawing to the surface with every incarnation whether I help it along or not. Can you get to me before my daughter regains sentience? What will Shadoe think of you when it all comes back to her and she remembers the pain of the many lives you’ve cost her? Will she still love you then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t forget anything. I certainly won’t forget what you owe me for the losses I’ve been dealt today.” Adrian killed the call, his focus narrowing on the woman who’d just revealed a colossal complication with her preternatural speed. Shadoe’s naphil gifts were strong in Lindsay, suggesting a deeper entwining of the two women than had been manifested in previous incarnations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was running out of time. Souls grew in power with age and experience. It was an inescapable fact that Shadoe would one day have the strength to overpower the soul of the vessel she occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them was prepared for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoving the phone in his pocket, Adrian closed the distance between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian Mitchell had immaculate feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her ridiculously comfortable seat in first class, Lindsay stared at the end of Adrian’s long, stretched out legs and realized she’d never paid much attention to a man’s feet before. Usually, she thought they were ugly: callused skin, crooked toes, absently trimmed and yellowed nails. Not Adrian’s. His feet were flawless in every way. In fact, everything about him was precisely symmetrical and expertly crafted. It was arresting how perfect he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, she met his gaze and smiled. She didn’t explain her preoccupation with his sandaled feet. It didn’t seem necessary, considering the way he was looking at her. The sexual attraction was a given. It was hot and edgy and made her body go a little haywire, but there was something softer in his regard, too. Something tender, almost intimate. She responded to it with fierce propriety. A primitive part of her was growling, He’s mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not eating your pretzel,” he noted, with that low sonorous articulation that made her want to settle in and stay a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so stringently contained, rigidly controlled. Even when she sensed turmoil in him, he gave no outward indication of it. His voice was always smooth and even, his posture relaxed and confident. Even when he’d been pacing, he had done so leisurely. The combination of that tight leash and his unrestrained sexuality was a potent turn-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her nature to make waves and stir things up, and she was going to do that with him. She was going to dig beneath that calm surface, because she was pretty damn certain still waters ran deep in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want it?” she offered. “I don’t want to ruin my appetite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled with amusement and she realized he had yet to smile fully. Her life was dark enough as it was; she usually went for guys who were lighthearted and fun-loving. It was a testament to his appeal that his subdued intensity didn’t dampen her interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would you like for dinner?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything. I’m easy.” The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them. “That came out wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ever worry about what you say around me, as long as you’re honest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honesty is my policy, which gets me in trouble a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some trouble is worth getting into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted within her slackened seat belt, canting her torso toward him. “What kind of trouble do you get into?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The epic kind,” he said wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faint touch of humor hit all her hot buttons. “I’m intrigued. Tell me more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s third-date material. You’ll have to stick around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would it be like to keep a man like Adrian? Just for a little while . . . “That’s extortion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked completely unrepentant. “I’m ruthless about getting what I want, which leads me back to the topic of what to cook for dinner. What’s your guilty pleasure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re cooking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless you object.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth curved. Adrian was clearly used to getting his way with no questions asked. “I should probably deny you at some point, just to keep you in your place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze smoldered. “And where would that be? The place where you’d like to put me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The place where I set the pace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like it already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Lindsay gave an approving nod. He was becoming more approachable by the minute. More real. “As for dinner at your place, I’m okay with that. But I want you to decide what’s on the menu. Impress me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No allergies? Nothing off-limits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a fan of liver, bugs, or meat that’s still bleeding.” Her nose wrinkled. “Aside from that, you’ve got carte blanche.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stipulations elicited his first real smile. “I’m not a fan of blood either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensual curving of his lips caused heat to spread outward from her tummy, pushing languidness through her limbs even as it gave her a potent headrush. She felt flushed and totally smitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt figured that the one guy to set her off like a rocket was also one who obviously had a lot more to him than met the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if what met the eye wasn’t enough . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you need bodyguards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian lifted his shoulder in an offhand shrug, his gaze trained on Lindsay as it had been since they’d entered his local organic grocery. She was long and lean, athletic. Her body was a credit to the Creator, and she kept it in prime shape. The way she carried her weight on her feet was notable for its predaceous grace. While her outward appearance was relaxed, he sensed the edge to her. His mood was affecting her strongly, yet she rolled with it, maintaining an admirable level of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in a lot better state than he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadoe’s return was shredding his equanimity. Shopping for dinner ingredients seemed absurd, considering the violent need tensing every muscle in his body. Here, finally, was the one woman who made him hunger and crave and feel as no other could. The one woman capable of making him acutely aware of every second of his two hundred years of celibacy . . . and he couldn’t have her. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Notoriety leads to unwanted attention,” he explained with studious evenness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was why he avoided going out in public when Shadoe wasn’t with him. He did so now because it served a variety of purposes—it continued his campaign to appear unfazed by the morning’s attack, it established normalcy and intimacy with Lindsay, and it gave her the opportunity to select the ingredients she preferred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the lycans who stood on either end of the produce section. “Dangerous attention? Your bullet catchers are pretty big guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes. Nothing for you to worry about. I’ll keep you safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I scared easily”—Lindsay picked up a sweet potato and dropped it into a plastic produce bag—“I wouldn’t have left the airport in a strange city with a guy I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew him, even if she didn’t realize why or how. It was obvious she relied on her gut instincts more than black-and-white reasoning, and that intuition was filling in the blanks on his behalf. She’d taken one look at him and set her sights. No hesitation. Just a straight-up, in-your-face I want you look that had volleyed the ball into his court with a rapid-fire salvo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay gestured at the nearly overflowing handbasket he was carrying. “I’m looking forward to watching you cook all this and seeing if I can pick up a few tips on how to prepare tempura, which is one of my favorite dishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you cook?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made her laugh. “Stovetop stuff. Nothing complicated. With a single-parent dad and a crazy college schedule, I’ve eaten out more than I’ve eaten in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll change that.” He reached for a Mayan sweet onion, then deliberately allowed it to tumble from his grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched it out of the air with nearly the same speed he’d used to catch Jason’s flying sunglasses earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here you go.” Lindsay tossed the vegetable to him, then turned away as if nothing extraordinary had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand fisted and the onion burst within his palm like a raw eggshell. As the fragrant juice flowed over his fingers, he cursed and willed the mess into a waste bin across the room with a terse thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay pivoted at the sound, turning so fluidly that her canvas messenger bag didn’t sway from her side. She’d withdrawn the large carryall from her checked luggage the moment she tugged it off the baggage carousel. Her haste had roused his curiosity. Why not carry it on the plane if the need for it was that immediate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian studied her. Her economy of movement was impressive. And worrisome. “You have great reflexes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze shifted downward. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could have played professional sports.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought about it.” Grabbing a bag of carrots, she placed it in his basket. “But I lack stamina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew why. Lindsay’s mortal body wasn’t built to sustain Shadoe’s naphil gifts. What he didn’t know was if she had just the speed or if there were other talents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of urgency swept over him. He had to take out Syre as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven knowing how drastically, perhaps catastrophically, the world would change when he killed the leader of the vampires, Adrian wasn’t deterred. Shadoe took precedence over everything. He’d made the mistake of putting himself first the night he attempted to circumvent her death; he would not be so selfish a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the cost would be high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mission was to contain and control the Fallen, not execute them. When he ended Syre’s life, he would be pulled from the earth for disobeying his orders, leaving the Sentinels without the captain they’d served under from their inception. The two factions—vampires and angels—would both be leaderless for a time, throwing the world into temporary chaos. But Shadoe’s soul would be freed of its enchainment to her father, and Adrian’s hypocrisy would be at an end. The mistake he’d made so long ago would finally be rectified. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-touch-of-crimson-renegade-angels-1/page-4.html","bookId":1983,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:21 AM"}
