the surrounding farms and hamlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick stood in a cow pasture a mile from the crossroads, holding in her hand a flashlight about the size of a pack of cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been on a weeklong course, run by the pilots of 161 Squadron, to train her for the task of guiding an aircraft in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis location fitted the specifications they had given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe field was almost a kilometer long-a Lysander needed six hundred meters to land and take off The ground beneath her feet was firm, and there was no slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nearby pond was clearly visible from the air in the moonlight, providing a useful landmark for pilots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel and Gilberte stood upwind of Flick in a straight line, also holding flashlights, and Claude stood a few yards to one side of Gilberte, making a flare path in the shape of an upside-down \"L\" to guide the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn remote areas, bonfires could be used instead of electric lights, but here, close to a village, it was too dangerous to leave the telltale burn mark on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four people formed what the agents called a reception committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s were always silent and disciplined, but less-well-organized groups sometimes turned the landing into a party, with groups of men shouting jokes and smoking cigarettes, and spectators from nearby villages turning up to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the pilot suspected that the landing had been betrayed to the Germans, and thought the Gestapo might be lying in wait, he had to react quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructions to reception committees warned that anyone approaching the plane from the wrong angle was liable to be shot by the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had never actually happened, but on one occasion a spectator had been run over by a Hudson bomber and killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting for the plane was always hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it did not arrive, Flick would face another twenty-four hours of unremitting tension and danger before the next opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut an agent never knew whether a plane would show up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not because the RAF was unreliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather, as the pilots of 161 Squadron had explained to Flick, the task of navigating a plane by moonlight across hundreds of miles of country was monumentally difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot used dead reckoning-calculating his position by direction, speed, and elapsed time-and tried to verify the result by landmarks such as rivers, towns, railway lines, and forests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with dead reckoning was that it was impossible to make an exact adjustment for the drift caused by wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the trouble with landmarks was that one river looked very much like another by moon- light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting to roughly the right area was difficult enough, but these pilots had to find an individual field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was a cloud hiding the moon it was impossible, and the plane would not even take oft However, this was a fine night, and Flick was hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, a couple of minutes before midnight, she heard the unmistakable sound of a single-engined plane, faint at first, then rapidly growing louder, like a burst of applause, and she felt a home going thrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to flash her light in the Morse letter \"X.\" If she flashed the wrong letter, the pilot would suspect a trap and go away without landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane circled once, then came down steeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt touched down on Flick\u0027s right, braked, turned between Michel and Claude, taxied back to Flick, and turned into the wind again, completing a long oval and finishing up ready for takeoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aircraft was a Westland Lysander, a small, high- winged monoplane, painted matte black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was flown by a crew of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had two seats for passengers, but Flick had known a \"Lizzie\" to carry four, one on the floor and one on the parcel shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot did not stop the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis aim was to remain on the ground no more than a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick wanted to hug Michel and wish him well, but she also wanted to slap his face and tell him to keep his hands off other women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was just as well that she had no time for either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a brief wave, Flick scrambled up the metal ladder, threw open the hatch, and climbed aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot glanced behind, and Flick gave him the thumbs-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little plane jerked forward and picked up speed, then rose into the air and climbed steeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick could see one or two lights in the village: country people were careless about the blackout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Flick had flown in, perilously late at four in the morning, she had been able to see from the air the red glare of the baker\u0027s oven, and driving through the village she had smelled the new bread, the essence of France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane banked to turn, and Flick saw the moonlit faces of Michel, Gilberte, and Claude as three white smears on the black background of the pasture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the plane leveled and headed for England, she realized with a sudden surge of grief that she might never see them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SECOND DAY Monday, May 29,1944
