While watching her various postures that were full of power as she fought against her enemies, the flame within Diaster’s heart shot straight up. He hoarsely cleared his throat, and then two concocted assistants walked over. They looked almost identical, with beautiful faces and captivating bodies, but their completely expressionless face and expressionless eyes shattered all perception of beauty. Diaster directly tore apart their clothes, staring rigidly at a freeze frame picture of the young lady jumping, grabbed one of the women, and then began to intensely and primitively move his body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, after his waist only moved a few times, forget about the main act, even before the prologue was finished, the battle preparation room’s automatic doors opened. A handsome and tall concocted male officer walked in, not paying what was currently happening inside any attention as he spoke in a clear voice, “Great commander, her majesty Pandora has connected to the command room, requesting for you to immediately head over and accept orders!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What?” Diaster, who had just had his appetite interrupted was naturally furious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe concocted man didn\u0027t understand what was fear, loudly repeating himself again. Diaster looked like he wanted to kill, but as her father, he understood Pandora’s bottom line well.

She looked at Diaster whose pants weren’t even fastened, her eyebrows lightly furrowing as she coldly said, “You should understand well why I connected to this place.

Several dozen factories of different sizes formed the jigsaw puzzle of this city. It was situated at the edge of the great lakes, more than ten meter thick water-absorbing pipelines reached deeply into the lake, crazily and continuously absorbing the lakewater. The water in the lake was blue, so pure it was like an enormous sapphire. However, when one approached the lakeshore, the powerful radiation would remind those who weren\u0027t careful that this was a region of death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSeveral thick smoke pipes that were several dozen meters thick stood vertically, their appearances extremely striking. They released white-colored steam, the turbine below relying on tremendous electrical energy. Scorpion Nest was almost completely automated, with all types of raw materials having specialized passages and exits. Meanwhile, concocted humans only needed to walk out from the examination room and into the equipment room, and then all of their equipment would already be placed in the designated location. After dressing themselves properly, they would then enter the weapon area to undergo system testing. Only, in the Scorpions of Disasters’ definition, concocted people and their equipment were an integral whole, a complete combat system. This was an incomparably large war machine, they still haven’t displayed its full potential in the past battles yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, today, after the last concocted human third class commander finished its examination, all of the weapon area installations closed one after another, with even the lighting going out, only the passages’ emergency lighting remaining. Meanwhile, in the past few days, all types of weapon production work had already stopped, to the extent where even the production of steel and all types of metal smelting factories also stopped their operations.
