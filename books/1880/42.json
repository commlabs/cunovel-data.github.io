{"id":83759,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m on the floor with Aidan when Laurelyn and Emma come in. The minute he sees Emma, he is no longer content with me and begins throwing another one of his screaming tantrums. I pick him up from the floor and pass him off to his mother. \"Here, take your titty baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack Henry! I can\u0027t believe you said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true, Laurelyn,\" Emma agrees. \"Aidan is a boob man.\" She goes to the couch with him and pulls a blanket up over her chest for coverage and begins nursing him. It\u0027s her third kid and she quit going into another room after Mila was born. It seriously freaked me out the first few times she did it in front of me, but I guess I\u0027m used to it now because it doesn\u0027t bother me anymore. \"I hated to leave him all day, but I needed to have a selfish moment and get away for a while. He wasn\u0027t terrible, was he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a man-to-man chat and I talked him down from the ledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma gives me an apologetic look. \"That bad, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it was pretty bad for a while but I hate to tell her how her kid showed his arse. \"Maybe for a little at first, but he got over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess. Evan dumped him on you?\" She knows her husband well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. He was busy with the girls so Aidan and I did some male bonding. I haven\u0027t gotten to see him much since he\u0027s been born. After he got over his little pissed-off spell, he was fine until he saw your boobs. Then he was done with Uncle Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurelyn is shaking her head and I suspect I\u0027ll be in trouble about the titty baby and boob comments when she gets me alone later, so I make an attempt to smooth it over. \"Did my beautiful bride find a dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe immediately begins beaming and I\u0027m certain that\u0027s a good sign. \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know she won\u0027t tell me, but I ask anyway. \"What does it look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A beautiful white dress for a bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s exactly the response I expected. \"You\u0027re not gonna tell me anything about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance.\" Shocker. \"You\u0027ll find out when you see me on our wedding day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Telling me about it isn\u0027t the equivalent of seeing you in it before the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I want it to be a complete surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"Whatever you want, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slips off one of her shoes and rubs her foot. \"Right now I just want to go back to the apartment and rest. These McLachlan women put a hurting on me with this shopping thing. I couldn\u0027t keep up with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a genetic thing for Mum and Chloe.\" They will not be stopped. \"Emma had to be trained and you will be too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see.\" Probably won\u0027t happen. Shopping isn\u0027t really Laurelyn\u0027s thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe isn\u0027t making a move to sit and I take that as a sign for us to head out. \"I think I need to get my bride-to-be home and run her a warm bath and then massage her feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slips her shoe back on. \"You have no idea how perfect that sounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma looks at Evan. \"You could take lessons from your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell that pisses him off. Good. \"Okay. Send these three kids home with them and I\u0027ll be happy to run you a bath and massage your feet if that\u0027s all I have to do—more than glad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be so cranky about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tired. These kids have done me in today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now you get what it\u0027s like for me all day, except you didn\u0027t have a human vacuum using you as a dummy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurelyn and I look at one another and begin easing toward the door. I\u0027m pretty sure neither of them notices our escape. We get in the car and begin laughing simultaneously when we look at each other because we know we\u0027ll be the same way, even if neither of us says it. And I can\u0027t wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week has flown because I\u0027ve been so busy making wedding plans. I can\u0027t believe how helpful Margaret, Chloe, and Emma have been. There\u0027s no way I could\u0027ve pulled this together without their help. I will be forever grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re in a formal restaurant for our engagement dinner party. Margaret said it was going to be a few friends and family. Yeah, right. There are at least thirty guests present and that doesn\u0027t include the immediate McLachlan family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve met too many people to keep them straight and I\u0027ve explained more times than I\u0027d like about my career. I excuse myself to the bathroom, but it\u0027s because I need a quiet minute away from the chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m leaning forward over the sole bathroom sink, applying a fresh coat of lipstick, when I see the reflection of a woman standing behind me. Our eyes meet in the mirror—and it\u0027s an awkward moment—but I allow her to win the stare-down when I avert my eyes. \"I\u0027m just finishing up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I debated if I should follow you in here or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a strange thing to say. \"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t in good conscience not warn you about the man you\u0027re sitting with at dinner tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s an attractive blond, probably in her late thirties. He told me he\u0027s always dated older women and I can only assume she\u0027s one of his former companions. I\u0027ve often wondered what this might feel like—running into one of the other twelve before me. I thought it might be a little easier after the whole Audrey thing, but it isn\u0027t. As I stare back into the blue eyes in the mirror, I could be sick at any moment. \"What number are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He keeps count?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone is bitter. What if she\u0027s a freak like Audrey? It might be best to nip this in the bud so she doesn\u0027t get any crazy ideas. \"I know all about his history, but he doesn\u0027t do that kind of thing anymore. We\u0027re engaged to be married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be so sure about that if I were you, honey. It hasn\u0027t been that long since he propositioned me in a hotel bar and took me upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what she\u0027s calling not long ago. \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was March twentieth. I remember the date because it was my birthday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my heart and stomach swap places as my nausea increases. \"I don\u0027t want to hear anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to be the one to break it to you, but I\u0027d want someone to warn me if the situation were reversed. Even if he is gorgeous, you don\u0027t want to be with a creep like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy does the room suddenly feel so warm? How can I feel so hot yet break into a cold sweat? Oh, everything is spinning. I reach up and begin to fan myself with my hand. \"I need to sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe helps me to the settee against the wall. \"I think they say you should put your head between your knees if you feel like you\u0027re going to pass out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t just feeling like I was going to faint. I was feeling like I was going to die from the pain of learning that the man I loved had been with this woman after I left and then lied to me about it. \"You don\u0027t look so well. Can I get someone for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s too bad Addison wasn\u0027t feeling well tonight. I wish she were here. \"Would you please go to my table and tell the woman in the purple dress that I need her without alarming everyone else that I\u0027m not feeling well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begin to feel worse after she leaves, so I lower myself to the floor. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m about to black out so I\u0027ll end up down there anyway, and it\u0027s better to be there by choice than by force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I must\u0027ve been unconscious for a brief moment because when I open my eyes and look up, Emma and Jack Henry are standing over me. Emma is on her knees beside me and she\u0027s holding my head in her lap while she blots my face with wet paper towels. \"Calm down, Jack. She\u0027s starting to come around now. Honey, are you okay?\" I blink several times but my blurry vision only slightly improves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s clearly not okay because she passed out.\" I hear the fear in his voice. \"What would\u0027ve caused that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could she be pregnant?\" Emma asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Henry hesitates before answering. \"Of course, there\u0027s a possibility but I don\u0027t think she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the blond explain, \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s my fault because I told her what you did to me at the Langford Hotel several months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is she talking about, Jack?\" I hear the confusion in Emma\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck did you tell her that caused her to end up like this?\" He\u0027s angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door creaks open and then I hear Margaret\u0027s voice. \"Good Lord, what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She passed out,\" Emma and Jack Henry say in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we call an ambulance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink some more and my vision improves, so I try again to find my voice. When I do, it\u0027s weak. \"No. Ambulance.\" I strain and see I can\u0027t sit up on my own. \"Help me sit up, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help her,\" Jack Henry says as he reaches for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t want you to touch me,\" I say when I feel his hand on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on here?\" I hear the confusion in Margaret\u0027s voice. \"Why would she say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing—just a little misunderstanding.\" I wish that were the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond is still there and offering unwanted help. \"Maybe she needs something to drink.\" I could certainly use something dark, straight, and stronger than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks.\" He walks over to the door and holds it open. \"I think you\u0027ve helped quite enough. Your assistance will no longer be needed here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t be but I can\u0027t stop myself from being angry with the blond woman—for being with him then, for being here now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away.\" She takes one look at my face and it registers that there\u0027s no place for her here, so she walks out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm attempts to help me to my feet, but I\u0027m still a wee bit wobbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be the one to take care of her.\" As much as I want to, I don\u0027t argue. Instead, I allow him to help me from the floor because I don\u0027t want to cause a scene in front of Emma and Margaret. Although I\u0027m incredibly hurt and furious with him right now, I\u0027d never want them to find out about the things he\u0027s done with other women, including the one he apparently fucked only a few days after I left. Keeping them in the dark has nothing to do with protecting him; I\u0027m keeping his secret to myself to protect them from seeing him the way I do right now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-42.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
