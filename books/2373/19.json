{"id":70045,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\u003cp\u003eBEING IN NEW YORK AGAIN, EXPERIENCING the sights and smells, was a homecoming of sorts for Grace. She felt safer in the city. Her new look helped, too: cropped, chocolate-brown hair, dark makeup, baggy, mannish clothes. One of the girls at Bedford had told her that altering one\u0027s walk could dramatically change people\u0027s perceptions. Grace had spent hours perfecting a longer-strided, less girlish gait. It was still unnerving, catching sight of her \"old\" face whenever she passed a television or a newsstand. But as the days passed, she grew more confident that the combination of her disguise and the crowded anonymity of the city would protect her, for a while at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer second day in the city, she\u0027d braved a hole-in-the-wall Internet cafe and sent a message to the Hotmail address Karen had given her using the specified code: \"200011209LW.\" Grace hoped this meant \"please send $2,000 to zip code 11209 in New York in the name of Lizzie Woolley,\" but she still felt certain that something would go wrong. Was $2,000 too much to ask for or too little? She realized belatedly she had no idea how much money Karen\u0027s friend had, or was willing to send her. On the other hand, she didn\u0027t want to have to risk doing this every other week, not with half the country\u0027s police departments out searching for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the pickup had been as smooth as Cora told her it would be. There was a Western Union outlet in the pharmacy on the corner. A fat, depressed man in his midforties had glanced at Grace\u0027s ID and, not even bothering to make eye contact, still less examine her features, handed her an envelope full of cash and a printed receipt. \"There you go, Ms. Woolley. Have a nice day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace began to focus less on being captured and more on her impending meeting with Davey Buccola. Davey had been researching the alibis of everyone she and Lenny had invited to Nantucket that fateful weekend. It still didn\u0027t seem fully real to Grace, the idea that the Prestons or the Merrivales or even one of her own sisters could have done such a terrible thing - stolen all that money, killed Lenny, caused her to be imprisoned and gotten away with it. But what other explanation was there? She hoped that when she saw Davey\u0027s research in black and white, it would make things clearer. Everything depended on that meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone in her tiny studio room, Grace pulled a stack of newspaper clippings out of the desk drawer and arranged them on the bed. There they were: Honor and Jack, Connie and Mike, Andrew and Maria and, of course, John and Caroline. Among them, those eight faces held the keys to the truth. Next to them, set slightly apart, Grace placed a ninth picture: Detective Mitchell Connors, the man whose job it was to catch her. He was definitely attractive. Grace found herself wondering if he was married, and if he loved his wife as much as she had loved Lenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would catch her eventually, of course. Her luck wouldn\u0027t hold out forever. But eventually didn\u0027t matter to Grace. What mattered was doing what she had set out to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, she spoke to Lenny, her words half promise, half prayer:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll do it, my darling. I\u0027ll do it for both of us. I\u0027ll find out who took you away from me and I\u0027ll make them pay, I promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept and grew strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MORE TEA, DETECTIVE? MY HUSBAND SHOULD be back any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonor Warner was visibly nervous. Mitch noticed the way her hands shook as she lifted the silver teakettle from its tray. Hot brown liquid spilled all over the white upholstered coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thank you, Mrs. Warner. It was really you I came to see. Has your sister made any attempt to contact you since her escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contact me? No. Absolutely not. If Grace had called, I\u0027d have let the police know immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch cocked his head to one side and smiled engagingly. \"Would you? Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was intrigued by this woman. She was Grace Brookstein\u0027s sister. At one time, by all accounts, the two women had been very close. They even looked alike. Yet when Grace fell from grace, Honor Warner had vanished into the ether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean? I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only that Grace is your sister,\" Mitch explained. \"It would be understandable for you to want to help her. It wouldn\u0027t be wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seemed to throw Honor completely. She looked around her, as if searching the room for a means of escape. Or perhaps she was scanning it for hidden microphones or cameras? Did she think she was being watched? Eventually she said, \"Grace made a lot of enemies, Detective. She\u0027s in greater danger out of prison than she is inside. I\u0027m thinking of her safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch fought back a smile. Like hell you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t go to the trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I understand it, you never visited your sister in Bedford Hills either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...my husband...we felt it was for the best. Jack\u0027s worked so hard to get to where he is today. For voters to associate him with Quorum...well. You understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch made no effort to hide his disgust. He understood perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading his thoughts, Honor said defensively, \"My husband has done a lot of good for his constituents, Detective. A lot of good. Is it right that he should be tainted by Lenny Brookstein\u0027s greed? Grace made her own choices. I\u0027m worried about her, but...\" She left the sentence hanging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch got to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mrs. Warner. I\u0027ll see myself out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WAS THE SAME STORY WITH Connie Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My youngest sister has never learned to take responsibility for her actions, Detective Connors. Grace believes she\u0027s entitled to wealth, to beauty, to happiness, to freedom. No matter what the cost to others. So in answer to your question, no, I don\u0027t feel sorry for her. And I certainly haven\u0027t heard from her. Nor do I expect to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith friends like Grace Brookstein\u0027s, who needed enemies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalking to Grace\u0027s compassionless, embittered sister, Mitch almost felt sorry for the woman whose greed had brought New York to its knees. Connie\u0027s anger was like a physical presence in the room, emanating from her body like heat from a radiator. The atmosphere was stifling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anyone else you can think of? Anyone Grace might call, or lean on? An old school friend perhaps? Or a childhood beau?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnie shook her head regally. \"No one. When Grace married Lenny, she got swept up into his world completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound disapproving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lenny and I...Let\u0027s just say we weren\u0027t close. I always thought he and Grace were a mismatch. In any event, there are no old friends. John Merrivale supported Grace for a while, I believe, until Caroline got him to see sense. Poor John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why \u0027poor John\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, Detective. You\u0027ve met him. He worshipped Lenny. He was his bag carrier for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was more than that, surely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John? No! Never!\" Connie laughed cruelly. \"The media paint him as some sort of financial wizard, a key Quorum insider. It\u0027s farcical! He wasn\u0027t even a partner, after the best part of twenty years. Lenny used him. So did Grace. Even now he\u0027s stuck cleaning up the mess at Quorum. No wonder your colleagues at the FBI haven\u0027t found that money. Talk about the blind leading the blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS OPENLY HOSTILE. People wanted answers and Mitch Connors didn\u0027t have them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost a week now since Grace Brookstein\u0027s dramatic escape from Bedford Hills and pressure was mounting on Mitch and his team to report some progress. The media seemed to have gotten it into their heads that the NYPD was withholding information. Mitch smiled. If only that were true! The truth was he had nothing. Grace Brookstein had walked out of that jail and vanished into thin air like David friggin\u0027 Blaine. She had contacted no one, not family, not friends. Yesterday, in a move that had been widely and correctly interpreted as desperation, the NYPD put out a $200,000 reward for anyone who provided information leading to Grace\u0027s capture. It was a mistake. Within two hours, Mitch\u0027s team had received over eight hundred calls. Apparently Grace Brookstein had been spotted everywhere from New York to Nova Scotia. A couple leads looked like they might pan out, but both ended up coming to nothing. Mitch felt like a kid trying to catch hold of bubbles, not knowing which way to turn and destroying everything he touched. And to think, he\u0027d thought this case would be a slam dunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it for today, folks. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grumbling press pack dispersed. Mitch crawled back to his office to hide, but it seemed there was to be no respite today. Detective Lieutenant Henry Dubray was no oil painting at the best of times. Today, squatting in Mitch\u0027s torture chair like a giant toad, he looked even worse than usual. His skin was blotchy and drink-ravaged, and the whites of his eyes were as yellow as sunflowers. The pressure of the Brookstein case was taking its toll on all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me some good news, Mitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Knicks won last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I. It was a great game. You didn\u0027t watch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch smiled. Dubray didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, boss. I don\u0027t know what to tell you. We got nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re running out of time, Mitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDubray left. There was nothing left to say. Both men knew the reality. If Mitch didn\u0027t come up with a solid lead in the next twenty-four hours, he\u0027d be taken off the case. Demoted, certainly. Maybe even fired. Mitch tried not to think about Celeste, and the expensive private school Helen wanted him to pay for. In that moment he hated Grace Brookstein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the whiteboard on the wall of his office. Grace\u0027s picture was in the middle. Radiating outward from it, like the points of a star, were various groups of other photos: Bedford Hills inmates and staff; Grace\u0027s family and friends; Quorum connections; members of the public who\u0027d called in with the most promising leads. How could so many sources lead to nothing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call for you on line one, Detective Connors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace Brookstein.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch gave a mirthless laugh. \"Yeah, thanks, Stella. I\u0027m not in the mood for crank callers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up. Thirty seconds later, the phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stella, I told you, I got enough problems without - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Detective Connors. This is Grace Brookstein speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch froze. After listening to hours of recordings of Grace\u0027s court testimony, he\u0027d have recognized her voice anywhere. He waved frantically to his colleagues in the outer office. \"It\u0027s her,\" he mouthed. \"Trace the call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a conscious effort to speak slowly. He couldn\u0027t show his excitement. More important, he had to keep her talking long enough to make the trace. \"Hello, Ms. Brookstein. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was the same as the one in the court recordings, but the tone was different. Harder, more determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband and I were framed. I never stole any money and neither did Lenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch paused, trying to keep her on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you telling me this, Ms. Brookstein? I\u0027m not a jury. Your conviction has nothing to do with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Mrs. Brookstein. I\u0027m a widow, Detective, not a divorcee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re a fool. You should never have made this call. Just keep talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you because I saw you on TV, and you look like a good man. An honest man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe compliment surprised Mitch. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like a man who would want to know the truth. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually I\u0027m a man who wants to keep you on the line for the next ten seconds. Nine...eight...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Mrs. Brookstein, the best thing you could do right now would be to turn yourself in.\" Six...five...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace laughed. \"Please, Detective. Don\u0027t insult my intelligence. I have to go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Wait! I can help you. If you are innocent, as you say you are, there are legal channels - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead. Mitch looked hopefully at the guys on the other side of the glass, but the shake of their heads told him what he already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two more seconds and we\u0027d\u0027ve had her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch sank into his chair and put his head in his hands. Immediately, the phone rang again. Mitch leaped on it like a jilted lover, willing it to be her. \"Grace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man\u0027s voice answered. \"Detective Connors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch felt the hope drain out of him like blood from a severed vein. \"Speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective, my name is John Rodville. I\u0027m the head of admissions at the Putnam Medical Center.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" Mitch said wearily. The name meant nothing to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a patient here, brought in last week with a knife wound to the back. He was in a coma till this morning. We didn\u0027t think he\u0027d make it. But he pulled through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s terrific, Mr. Rodville. I\u0027m happy for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch was at the point of hanging up when the man said cheerily, \"Yeah, I thought you might be. Especially since he just identified his attacker as Grace Brookstein.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-19.html","bookId":2373,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM"}
