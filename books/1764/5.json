The paper in my pocket feels heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening train is less somber than the morning’s was. Basil is trying to cheer me with plans for the weekend. He thinks we should go to the theater; one of his favorite books has just been adapted into a play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rest my head on his shoulder. His collarbone presses into my cheek, and I breathe in the sharp linen of his uniform and something faintly spicy-sweet. Up until last year, he smelled only of soap, if anything at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to walk me to the door,” I say. His train stop is right after mine, and if he walks me inside, he’ll have to walk a section over to his apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t mind,” he says as the train begins to slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be safer on the train,” I say. “It’d make me feel a lot better. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. I’ll protect her,” Pen says, tugging me to my feet after the train’s final jolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come by tomorrow afternoon,” I tell him. “We’ll see the play if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe step off the train and Pen checks her reflection in her wristwatch. “You’re lucky, you know,” she says. “You aren’t doomed to marry a complete ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patrolmen open the double doors for us, nod as we pass through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe Thomas isn’t as bad as all that,” I say. Her being envious of Basil would defeat the purpose of arranged betrothals. “Plenty of couples argue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll never fancy him,” she says. “He has a face like composted broccoli.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “No he doesn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He does. Which is why I intend to never enter the queue. I couldn’t inflict such awful cheekbones on future generations, even if there’s a chance our children could look like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it’s a long way off, I’ve given some thought to the queue. I might like having children, but more than that, I think my parents would want a grandchild. Lex and Alice will never be eligible now that he’s disabled, but they applied for it six years ago when they were newlyweds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of Internment’s land limitations, there can’t be a round of pregnancies until there has been a sufficient amount of deaths. It’s a long wait—years—which is why so many couples enter the queue while they’re still university students. My parents reentered the day my brother was born, and it was more than seven years before they were allowed to have me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice got pregnant out of turn. It wasn’t intentional; she’d been neglectful with her pill. She pleaded with the decision makers, even writing a personal appeal to the king himself, but she was years from the front of the queue. She offered to give her child to the next eligible couple, as a last-ditch effort to let her child be born, but of course that isn’t allowed—giving away a child could lead to resentment and jealousy, which could prove dangerous. There’s a story in The History of Internment to prove that, something about a woman who decided she’d rather smother her child than allow it to belong to someone else. Pen knows it better than I do. She has the history book memorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter weeks of fighting for her cause, Alice was forced to have a termination procedure. She came home from the hospital with darkness under her eyes, and she retreated immediately to bed, where she stayed for days. Her skin and even her hair seemed to have lost their color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her a very long time to act like Alice again. I would follow her around the apartment and on her weekend errands, coaxing her to take me shopping for new jewelry and to tea shops, throwing my arms around her without warning on shuttles and while she was cooking dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLex won’t have anything to do with pharmaceuticals now. In studying medicine, he used to help manufacture the elixirs that precede the termination procedures, among other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen is still musing about the queue. “You do have nice eyes,” she tells me. “Blue isn’t very dominant against brown, though, is it? Well, still, Basil isn’t unattractive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re standing in front of her apartment door now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should come to the play with us tomorrow,” I say. “Bring Thomas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” she sighs. “If my mother is having one of her headaches, she’ll want me out of the apartment anyway. See you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my apartment, I find my mother sleeping on the couch, curled in Lex’s blanket. There’s a hot plate waiting in the stove for me, but I’m not hungry. I work on my homework for a while, but the silence feels crushing and it doesn’t take long for me to get restless enough to go upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, there are signs of life in Lex and Alice’s apartment. Alice is standing on the kitchen table in impractical black heels, trying to change a lightbulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morgan’s here now,” Lex says before I’ve even stepped into the apartment. “Let her help you. You’re going to fall and break your face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not going to break my face,” she says, cursing when she burns her fingertips on the bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab a new bulb from the package at her feet and hold it up. “You’re a peach,” she says, stooping to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going out in a few minutes, you know,” Lex says. “It’s Friday. Jumper group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was hoping you’d let me tag along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice climbs down from the table and dusts her hands on her shirtfront. “I don’t see why not,” she says. “It’ll give me someone to talk to, at least. I’m always left waiting in the hallway. They don’t even offer me any of their snacks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell Mom so she doesn’t worry,” Lex says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s sleeping. Already left a note.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice runs the tap and smoothes water over some defiant strands of hair. She’s done it up in elaborate curls held in place by bronze clips that compliment her curls’ many shades of red. She’s wearing a blue dress that curls and billows around her knees and elbows as she moves through the mundane tasks of putting away the bulbs and straightening an image on the wall. Sometimes she’s unreal. Something that floated down from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the incident, she and Lex were seldom home. She had a dress for every color the sun illuminates and there was always cause to wear one. Even when I was a child, I admired the love they had, the way every outing, every dinner party or hike through the woods was an adventure. Now Alice dresses up only for weekend errands, and Lex’s jumper group every Friday, even though the only people to see her are the shuttle and train passengers. Her job in the gardens requires a drab uniform that I’ve always thought looked like it was trying to smother her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel underdressed in my academy uniform, yet I know that I won’t have time to change. Alice, reading my mind, disappears to the bedroom and returns, pressing silver earrings into my palm; they’re shaped like stars cascading down little chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better get moving,” she says, jostling the back of Lex’s chair. “If we miss the train, we’ll have to walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the sky has become a deeper blue, filling fast with stars. As we step onto the train platform, Lex crushes a daisy that’s growing between the cobbles. I wonder if he remembers what flowers are, not only what they look like, but that they exist at all. He’s knocked over plenty of Alice’s vases, and he has no idea what the shattering glass was before he ruined it. He’s told me that he can’t remember how eyelashes are shaped. He can’t conjure an image of our mother’s window boxes full of tomato plants, though he had looked at them every day of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seven thirty train isn’t crowded. There’s a group of men in suits at the far end of the car; one of them tips his hat flirtatiously to Alice, and she tugs on her earring, smirking for a moment before turning her attention to ushering Lex into his seat. There’s a mother listening patiently as her young child recites the multiplication tables. There’s a girl traveling alone, which I wouldn’t have found strange before the murder. She’s wearing the blue necktie worn by sixth-through eighth-year students. She’s young but her face is pointed up, and something about the ferocity in her eyes is vaguely familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside me, Alice rests her head on Lex’s shoulder, and he rubs her arm, says something in her ear that makes her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA patrolman paces the aisle after the train has begun to move, and the girl in the blue tie plays with the ring hanging from her neck as she watches him. I’m sure I’m imagining the snarl she gives once he has passed by. Her eyes meet mine and I look away. I watch the sky slowly turning darker blue. In the long season, the sun burns until late evening, but the short season is approaching now and the days are getting shorter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll have two hours to burn,” Alice says. “There’s a tea shop at the end of the block we could try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you feeling okay?” she says. “You seem a little distant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the eyes of the girl in the blue tie watching me, though I don’t look in her direction to confirm. And I feel the patrolman watching me, not just here but everywhere I go. For the first time in my life, I feel unsafe and I don’t know how to help it. The king has insisted that we go about our lives as normal, that the patrolmen will keep us safe, but who was there to keep Daphne Leander safe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad shouldn’t have let you watch the broadcast,” Lex says. “All it’s done is cause you to worry about everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I needed to see it,” I say. “I don’t need to be sheltered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Says the girl who still sleeps with the light on after I tell her a harmless ghost story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was years ago,” I say. “I’m not a baby, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am certain it was only last season,” Lex says, and his voice deepens when he adds, “The tale of the ghost birds that flew into the city and pecked everyone to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t recall leaving any lights on,” I say, and am impressed by my cool tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t listen to him,” Alice says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do they sell sweets at the tea shop?” I say. “I skipped dinner and now I’m hungry.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-ruin-the-internment-chronicles-1/page-5.html","bookId":1764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:38 AM"}
