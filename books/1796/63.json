You ready?\" He moved toward the entrance and shone the flashlight into a small, square room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity came up behind him and followed the light. She was immediately assailed by an overpowering sense of déjà vu. This was the room she had seen last night when she had worn her new earrings, during the second psychic-awareness session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, I know this room. I\u0027ve seen it. There should be a black chest in here somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ. You\u0027re right. There it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA massively carved stone chest squatted in the corner of the cell-like room. Jonas went toward it cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be safe enough to approach it, Jonas. The footsteps go up to it and come back.\" Verity didn\u0027t like the look of the black chest, though. It resembled a coffin. Her earrings felt very warm against her cheeks. \"It\u0027s the chest we see in the vision, isn\u0027t it? The one with the heaps of gold coins and gems in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas reached the chest and examined it from all angles. \"The lock is open. Let\u0027s see what\u0027s inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, be careful.\" Verity lost her nerve. A rush of anxiety came over her. \"Don\u0027t touch it. I don\u0027t think we should open it. Forget Harvard, there are plenty of good state universities. Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke too late. Jonas raised the lid of the black chest. In spite of her fear, Verity couldn\u0027t resist going closer to see what was inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Empty,\" she said in mingled disappointment and relief. \"Damn. I wonder if whoever killed Digby cleaned it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. Still, this chest alone will be worth a fortune to some museum. Take a look at the carving. It\u0027s magnificent. Too bad it belongs to Doug and Elyssa. AH we\u0027re going to get out of this is a consulting fee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas looked up, his features stark in the glow of the flashlight. \"Let me have that sword hilt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s hand tightened around the broken sword handle. \"Why?\" she demanded suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want another look at that vision of the man at the desk. I want to see if this is the room he was sitting in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it is. But I\u0027m not sure we should mess around with that particular vision. There\u0027s something very weird about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatiently he reached out and took the chunk of metal from her. So much for trying to give good advice, Verity thought as the walls of the dark cell began to curve around them. People like Jonas rarely listened to good advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity held her breath as the image shimmered and took form. Her earrings were turning hot against her skin. She started to remove them, staring at the vision of the man as she did so. Whoever he was, he had been capable of violence, she thought suddenly. She could see that much in the forbidding lines of his aristocratic features and the malevolent glare of his frozen eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small, green, egg-shaped crystal on the desk seemed to pulse gently in the reflected glow of the flashlight. But that was impossible, Verity reminded herself. The images produced in the psychic corridor never reacted to outside illumination. They existed independently in time and space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity cried out softly as her earrings became so hot they seemed to burn her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas,\" she whispered. \"The crystal. The one on his desk. It\u0027s still here in the villa. It\u0027s somewhere nearby. I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think the crystal is still around here?\" Jonas studied the frozen image in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp planes of his face were illuminated by the poisonous green glow of the vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. I get the feeling the crystal on that desk is trying to connect with itself in real time. It\u0027s as if it tried my earrings and they didn\u0027t quite work. It sounds crazy, I know.\" Verity shook her head. She was experiencing a disturbing sense of unreality. It was different from the feeling she usually had while in the psychic corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing about this image makes much sense,\" Jonas said. \"That\u0027s what bothers me. It\u0027s just not a normal time-corridor film clip. I\u0027ve got to find out what the hell is going on here, Verity. I can\u0027t leave this place until I know what this is all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t even a scene of violence. You only pick up scenes of violence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I tune it in by using an object associated with violence. That part is normal enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity edged backward a step. \"It\u0027s almost as if the violence is about to happen, but hasn\u0027t yet taken place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn. Verity, I think you\u0027re right. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s the answer. We\u0027re looking at the scene an instant or two before the action took place. This guy was probably sitting at his desk when someone walked in and killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why aren\u0027t we catching the actual death scene? Why would we pick up on it a few seconds before it occurs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027ve got to find out. I can feel the sense of warning emanating from this thing. It\u0027s as if that guy is just sitting there daring me to try to get at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or daring you to uncover his treasure,\" Verity offered, glancing around at the barren cell. \"Obviously he doesn\u0027t realize someone else has already gotten to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas walked to the chest and ran his palm along the heavily carved lid. \"I\u0027m not so sure the treasure is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, don\u0027t do that,\" Verity said, watching the image uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch the chest? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear his eyes are following you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just an optical illusion,\" he said absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity bit her lip, studying the image. The chest was still there behind the man, filled with treasure. \"Why wasn\u0027t this room discovered when the villa was taken apart and shipped over here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? Digby says in his diary that his relative had huge chunks of the villa left intact and transported that way. This room is small enough that it might have been shipped as a single unit. Maybe no one was even aware there was an opening behind these walls. It could look like a solid block of stone from the outside. Or it\u0027s possible Digby\u0027s crazy relative did find the room and the chest, and ordered it reconstructed exactly as it was. In which case, he\u0027s probably the one who got the treasure, although he never admitted it to anyone. Eccentric was a mild term for Digby\u0027s side of the family, apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the rest of the furnishings were all sold off. I can\u0027t believe someone would have overlooked that valuable chest.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-63.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 PM"}
