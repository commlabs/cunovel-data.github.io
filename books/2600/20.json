What am I supposed to think? It\u0027s like I don\u0027t even know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny followed behind him, still buttoning her shirt. \"It\u0027s not an easy thing to tell somebody, okay? I mean, hell, remember Jenny Mackenzie from Victorian lit last semester? She got the clap over the summer and still hasn\u0027t told her boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s different. It\u0027s always different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re very very different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to treat me any different,\" Penny insisted. \"I don\u0027t need your... your racism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Racism? It\u0027s not like you\u0027re Chinese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Animalism then,\" Penny said. \"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you\u0027re a... a-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolf,\" Penny said. \"We hate that word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen walked in a widening circle, bent over, scanning the ground. The first rays of dawn helped only a little. \"What\u0027s the right word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lycanthrope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lycan-what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lycanthropy is a disorder,\" Penny said. \"A rare virus in conjunction with an even rarer genetic predisposition. The Third Vatican Council ruled it as a medical condition. As opposed to the work of Satan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of a Third Vatican Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not supposed to have.\" Penny scanned the ground now too. \"Where did you drop it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Allen said. \"I was slightly terrified at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Following your scent was the only way I could think to find you, and I can only do that in wolf form. How many times do I have to say I\u0027m sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sighed. \"I just need to let this sink in. It\u0027s been a strange couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For me too,\" Penny said. \"That\u0027s not really how I wanted you to see me naked for the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over here!\" Amy\u0027s voice came from forty yards away, through more thick bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen and Penny found Amy. She handed him the manuscript, still bound up with twine and newspaper. There were leaves in Amy\u0027s hair, grass stains on her shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open it,\" Penny said. \"I want to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not here.\" Allen clutched the manuscript to his chest. \"It\u0027s too old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know what it is,\" Penny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. It\u0027s Edward Kelley\u0027s diary. The alchemist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to my apartment,\" Penny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Amy said quickly. \"They\u0027ll think to look there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I didn\u0027t tell Father Paul where we were,\" Penny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny sputtered. \"You don\u0027t... after I let you see me... Oh, my God. You suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not saying your motives are bad,\" Amy said. \"I just won\u0027t risk it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you so very much suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just need a table and someplace quiet,\" Allen said. \"Preferably not too crowded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a library?\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been there. Done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a place,\" Penny said, \"but it won\u0027t be open yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then,\" Amy said. \"Breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked back through Mala Strana in no particular hurry. The city was waking, the morning cool and dewy. They circled Prague Castle on the north side, pausing to gander at the walls and towers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In there.\" Allen tapped the Kelley diary. \"That\u0027s where he wrote it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued on, back through Letna Park. In the light of day it was pleasant, trees arching in a canopy over the path. Allen pictured himself here with Penny under other circumstances, walking hand in hand, on the way for a cup of coffee. Two healthy young people in an exotic foreign country. Why couldn\u0027t it be that simple?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the Hole\u0026amp;#353;ovice suburb and found a hip little caf¨¦ that was just opening, serving eggs, toast, sausage heavy enough to sink a naval destroyer, and coffee so strong it could eat the paint off the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Push the dishes aside,\" Penny said. \"Let\u0027s see the diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen shook his head. \"No way. Spill some of that coffee on it, and the whole thing will disintegrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so curious, I can\u0027t stand it,\" she said. \"How did you even know to look for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen went a little pale remembering his encounter with Cassandra. He couldn\u0027t quite bring himself to relate that experience to Penny just yet. Then he remembered there was something else he hadn\u0027t told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Penny, Professor Evergreen is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen related the story to the girls, how he\u0027d found the professor dead, the chunk bitten out of his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" Penny whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy said, \"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny\u0027s eyes went big. \"Did you just say \u0027good\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t mean I hope he suffered or anything like that. It\u0027s just good he\u0027s out of the way. He was a traitor to the Society. We were all pretty worried he\u0027d get a hold of the philosopher\u0027s stone and do something really fucked up with it. His wife\u0027s a vampire, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny sputtered coffee. \"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unbelievable,\" Penny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy pointed a finger at her. \"You\u0027re a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lycanthrope!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy narrowed her eyes, turned back to Allen. \"How did you know about the diary? How did you know to look in the monastery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen opened his mouth to tell them. Of course he would tell them. Time to come clean. These people were on his side. So why wouldn\u0027t the words come out? He suddenly felt Cassandra\u0027s cold touch and shivered. He realized with acute dread that whatever spell the vampire had put on him had not completely evaporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hand for the waitress. \"Check, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny said she\u0027d found the place her first day, tired and jet lagged but too excited to sleep. She\u0027d strolled the streets of Hole\u0026amp;#353;ovice and stumbled upon the Veletrzni Palace-the Trade Fair Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gleaming example of modern architecture, the Trade Fair Palace housed Prague\u0027s collection of twentieth-century art and was one of the main reasons tourists made it out to the suburb. The four floors of paintings and sculptures attracted groups of students on the weekends, but on an early weekday morning, the small caf¨¦ in the lobby was utterly deserted. All very modern, sharp angles and white plastic, metal chairs that looked uncomfortable but weren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have a couple of Picassos here,\" Penny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen held up his copy of The Rogue\u0027s Guide. \"This place isn\u0027t even in here. All this book tells you is where to get drunk and laid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny laughed. \"You\u0027re not actually using that to get around Prague, are you? That was a gag gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey picked the table farthest from the entrance, and Allen untied the twine, peeled away the newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and Penny crowded in on either side of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do this with you reading over my shoulder,\" he said. \"You\u0027re making me anxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re curious too,\" Penny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy crossed her arms. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, just wait. Hold on.\" Allen pointed at the caf¨¦ counter. \"I need napkins and plastic coffee stirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One second.\" Penny went to fetch them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bite,\" Amy said. \"Napkins and coffee stirs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These old manuscripts damage easily.\" Allen ran his hand lightly over the leather cover. \"Watch and learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny returned with the napkins and stirs, gave them to Allen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Allen pointed to the chairs on the opposite side of the table. \"Both of you sit over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls looked at each other and frowned, but they took their seats without complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen took the cracked and worn leather cover between thumb and forefinger, and opened the manuscript with utmost care. Edward Kelley\u0027s erratic scrawl was faded but legible. Allen began to read, skimming, slowing down occasionally to determine if a particular passage was pertinent. He used the plastic coffee stirs like surgical instruments to carefully turn the pages, sneaking a stir under an edge, lifting it carefully, catching the page with the other stir and letting it down again delicately. When he came to some caked-on dust, he dabbed at it with one of the napkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to read some of that to us?\" Penny asked. \"Or do we just sit here watching you turn those pages with plastic sticks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not all relevant, okay?\" Allen gestured at the thick manuscript. \"This thing looks like it covers months and months. Maybe more. Probably what we want is toward the end, but I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know anything. I have to go through all this, and I\u0027m trying to do it fast, but I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to find or when.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read us something,\" Amy pleaded. \"We can\u0027t stand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Allen said. \"Here\u0027s a sample.\" He read the following passage out loud:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis serving maid is unquenchable. Last night she used her mouth on me in ways that surely are sins in the eyes of the Church. She begged me to return the favor. Unfortunately, I do not believe she had bathed in several days and-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" Penny said. \"We\u0027ll do it your way.\" She nudged Amy. \"You want some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy grimaced. \"No way. The last cup almost ate through my stomach. Some tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be right back.\" Penny left for the caf¨¦ counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy waited until Penny was out of earshot, then said, \"You\u0027re holding back something about the vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could tell. Back at breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know where to look for the diary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen hesitated. \"Dr. Evergreen told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said he was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He... told me before he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a terrible liar, Allen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, yes. It was Cassandra. She made me fetch the diary from the monastery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She \u0027made\u0027 you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sighed. \"It\u0027s sort of... complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen, if she sent you for it, then she\u0027ll want it. When night hits, she\u0027ll come, and then we\u0027ll have a vampire on our hands. The Society thought Evergreen had something bad planned for the philosopher\u0027s stone, but it was Cassandra all along, wasn\u0027t it? She needs it for something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t tell me for what,\" Allen said. \"But I plan to find out. She may have sent me to find the diary, but I didn\u0027t take it to her, did I? I\u0027m going to get to the bottom of this, but I\u0027ll need your help, okay? I just... I don\u0027t want to say anything to Penny about Cassandra. It\u0027s embarrassing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Embarrassing? But why would-\" Amy\u0027s eyes went big, comprehension dawning in her expression. \"Oh, my God. Did she do that vampire hypnotism thing on you? Did she seduce you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your voice down.\" He felt himself turn red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen saw Penny returning with tea and coffee. \"Shush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s hot,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen glared her into silence just as Penny sat down and passed a mug of tea to Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I miss anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" Allen kept his eyes fixed on the manuscript, deliberately not looking at either of the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused on passages, trying to find something important. Kelley went on and on about life at the castle, lengthy tirades against somebody named Dee. He skipped ahead, feeling a little more urgency to get to the meat of the matter. Amy and Penny lapsed into a conversation about shoes, then poetry, then where Amy had attended college. Allen tuned them out, focusing on Kelley\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last he found something, but he reread it again to be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen cleared his throat. \"Ladies, I think you might want to hear this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRAGUE CASTLE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1601 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-20.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
