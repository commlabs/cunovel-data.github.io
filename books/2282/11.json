It hadn’t gone so well; he’d tried to dismantle the alarm and a wire had shorted out, sending electric volts shooting through him. He’d been discovered on the ground near the back door the following morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTragically the joke had been on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust three years ago, another of the older docents or tour guides, Angela Wilson, had been found dead in Tarleton’s study. She’d been sitting in the same chair, in the same position, as Julian Mitchell. She had died of a massive heart attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne death from a fall, one from electrocution and one from what might well be a perfectly natural cause for someone of Angela’s age, a heart attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now a man dead of a bayonet shoved through his throat—as if he’d set his own chin atop it for the blade to run through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler drummed his fingers on the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was here because of Adam Harrison. Adam had a love of and connection to various historic properties. Technically, the Krewes were Adam’s teams, so they went where Adam Harrison requested they go. Everything that had happened here could have been natural or accidental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Adam had a knack of knowing when things weren’t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd in the trashing of the small office in the attic….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had been looking for something. What? And why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how did any of it relate to the fact that Artie Dixon was in a coma?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler pulled out his cell phone and called Logan Raintree, one of his best friends, a fellow Ranger at one time, and now the head of their unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it something—or nothing?” Logan asked. “Do you need the rest of the Krewe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something,” Tyler said. “And yes. I’d like you to come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any idea as to what’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. But the house has been closed down for the interim. I think we should set up here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be in tomorrow night,” Logan promised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler hung up and put through another call. When he reached Adam Harrison, he asked about keys to the attic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The board members all have a key, and so does Allison. There’s also a key in the small pantry or storage room, where the employees have their lockers and keep their street clothing. It’s always hung on a peg there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the pantry locked during the day?” Tyler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not from what I understand. The employees slip in and out when they have a break or need to get to their own belongings. No member of the public goes into the house without a docent or tour guide, and they’ve never had trouble before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll see if that key is still in place, but a lot of people have keys. They could have been used—or copied at a previous date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I lost my guide,” Tyler told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can call someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler hesitated. Maybe that was the right thing to do. Bring in someone who hadn’t discovered a dead friend at the house. Someone who wasn’t derisive of the investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he realized he didn’t want anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as far as her attitude was concerned… It didn’t matter if you believed the world was round or not, because it was round regardless of what you believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Allison would accept the fact that something existed in the Tarleton-Dandridge House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as Todd had suggested, it liked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Adam. I’ll move along on my own for a bit, see if Ms. Leigh begins to show some interest. I’m sure her heart is in the right place. I’ll give her more time. The rest of the team will be in tomorrow night, and we’ll see where we are then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam agreed with him and they hung up. Tyler immediately went to the guides’ room; the key hung on a peg there, so access to the attic was ridiculously easy. He returned to the study, picking up the folders that held information on the board members. Pausing, he looked at the painting of Beast Bradley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been perceived so differently by the two artists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, fascinated by the painting, and walked over to it. A Plexiglas cover protected it and he saw that, apparently from the time it had been hung, it had resided on that wall to avoid direct sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to read the signature of the artist and was surprised to realize that the name was T. Dandridge. He squinted to find the date; the painting had been done in 1781. The year the Colonies had finally achieved their independence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Yes, the artist of this particular likeness had truly loathed his subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler left the study and went up the stairs, back to Lucy Tarleton’s room, and looked at the painting there. The signature appeared to be Josiah Bell. The work was dated 1777.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThoughtful, Tyler returned to the study once more. A truism in life was that everyone perceived others in their own way. Where one person saw kindness in someone, another saw weakness. Where one saw cruelty, another saw strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerception. Always nine-tenths of reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Sadly, he was certain, Allison Leigh saw him as an oversize quack. A pretentious hick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmused, he considered his own perceptions of her. A woman with a lot of pride and yet humility. A lover of truth and honor, but stubborn and determined. Stunning with her pitch-dark hair and bright blue eyes, but dismissive of her looks. The woman was a scholar, after all, and took her work seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped she’d come around. There was just something about her—something in the helpless look she’d given Todd, something that was kind and empathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite the situation—despite her exhausted, annoyed and bewildered behavior toward him—he still found her…sensual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost likes her, Todd had said. Yes, sometimes ghosts watched a person, and just as the living did, they knew who they liked—and who they didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the painting. It didn’t move, but Todd was right. The eyes had been well-painted, giving the illusion that the painting could watch someone moving about the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back in his chair. “I am here,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was greeted by silence. There were secrets in this house, but so far, the ghostly inhabitants were guarding those secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of his coworkers had known from the time they were children that they had an extra sense, whether they saw it as a gift or a curse. They’d had grandparents or friends who’d appeared at their own funerals or talked to them in the middle of the night, or even showed up in other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler, however, had no clue he had any unusual abilities until he’d done a stint in the service and then come home to become a Texas Ranger. He’d loved stories about the Rangers all his life; becoming a Ranger had been a dream. It was when he’d been a Ranger for a year that he’d first experienced the unusual. The situation had been especially poignant. Drug runners had kidnapped their mule’s younger sister. The older sister had become a heroin addict, and when she hadn’t been able to produce the money they’d wanted quickly enough, they’d killed her with an overdose. The younger sister had been left to rot at the bottom of a cistern out on the dusty Texas plain. A desperate, state-wide search had been instigated to find the seventeen-year-old. Tyler was standing in the middle of the sprawling ranch house where the drug runners were based when the older sister, pathetic, shaking and twitching, had appeared to him, begging him to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he’d been drinking too much; he tried to tell himself that he wasn’t seeing what he was seeing. She followed him. She was next to him even when he was with other officers. She didn’t know where her sister was, but he had to help her, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trying. He was trying so damned hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed on his shift for several extra hours, searching the house, the barn, the stables, everywhere. He headed back to a bar for the night and discovered the dead woman on the stool next to him. He went home and she invaded his bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning he got up and joined the search again, quizzing his ghost relentlessly about the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, he found the younger sister in the cistern. He found her alive—shaken and dehydrated, but alive. His crying, grateful ghost left him, and for months afterward, he wondered if the pressure of the case hadn’t made him delusional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he’d walked into his office one day to see an old man sitting by his desk. No one else saw this old man, who wanted Tyler to find his murderer. Eventually he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poor guy’s son-in-law had figured he wasn’t leaving the world soon enough and had helped him meet his Maker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time, he’d thought he was crazy. But as he and Logan Raintree worked together, they each learned that the other saw unusual things. That they both did. When Logan was approached by Jackson Crow, head of the first Krewe, and then Tyler was asked to join, as well, he felt it was the right thing to do. And it had been. They’d solved cases. Saved lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they uncovered the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d also learned that not all ghosts walked over to a man and started up a conversation. Some chose to speak only to certain people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the living did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook off his memories and returned to the information on the four board members who ran the private Old Philly History Corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Pierson, forty-five, real estate broker by day, financially comfortable with excellent stock investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Vining, fifty-one, philanthropist, wealthy due to an oil inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCherry Addison, forty-three, a direct descendent of the Tarleton-Dandridge family on the maternal side, a former model and sometime actress with family money. Married to an artist of increasing renown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan Oxford, seventy-two, lawyer and politician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to meet them all. The best way to do that might be to call an impromptu board meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler realized he wasn’t giving the attention he should to the folders. He rose and stretched. As he did, he thought he heard something from the rear of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the study, looking at the rooms and the elegant entry as he walked to the front door. Nothing seemed to have changed. He strode through the rooms and then to the back door, unlocking it to step outside. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-uninvited-krewe-of-hunters-8/page-11.html","bookId":2282,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM"}
