It immediately paused for a moment before it carried an unusually powerful pressure and energy fluctuation as it violently clashed against the energy longsword that shot over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two extremely frightening attacks met in the sky an instant later. A thunder-like explosion suddenly resounded over the sky. Despite having been prepared for it, there were still quite a number of people whose ears rang for awhile. Even their vision had become a little blurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaves of substance-like energy ripples fluctuated wildly from the spot where the two fierce attacks collided. Even the space itself had become distorted under this frightening energy collision. From this, one could tell just how frightening the attacks the two people had unleashed were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distorted space also enveloped the spots where Xiao Yan and Yun Shan stood. Hence, the many gazes that were looking at the sky did not know just who among these two people had obtained an advantage in this frightening energy collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy ripple that spread through the air slowly faded away in front of the focus of a countless number of gazes a moment later. That distorted space had also gradually become clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the space recovered, the two figures on the distant sky appeared in front of everyone’s sight. Everyone involuntarily became startled when they saw the human figures that appeared in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, both of Xiao Yan’s sleeves were torn apart, revealing his naked arms. There were also numerous small blood traces that faintly covered his arms. His face was also a little pale and the corner of his mouth had the vague traces of blood. His originally powerful aura had also become much weaker at this moment. Clearly, the soul-stirring big collision earlier had still shaken him until he had received some serious injuries despite him having been considered to have received it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Xiao Yan appeared miserable, Yun Shan on the other side was also not safe and sound. His clothes were just as broken and his shriveled hand that was revealed outside his sleeves trembled slightly. A thread of blood followed his palm and flowed downward before finally moving along his finger and quietly dripped down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite a number of people quietly inhaled a breath of cool air as they looked at Yun Shan with blood dripping from his hand. Their gazes immediately looked at the black-robed, young man with surprise. No one expected this fellow to be able to receive the frightening blow from Yun Shan earlier and also cause some injuries to appear on the latter’s body…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJia Xingtian, Hai Bodong, and the others in the chaotic battleground also revealed stunned expressions as they looked at Yun Shan, who revealed trembling hands and a dark-water expression. Although they always had confidence in Xiao Yan, their hearts still involuntarily shook when they personally witnessed Xiao Yan receive that frightening attack that could seriously injure even an expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun by the wedding stage also quietly sighed in relief when she saw that Xiao Yan was not killed by Yun Shan’s attack. However, a complicated emotion flashed across her pretty face when she saw the blood dripping from Yun Shan’s hand. She did not wish to see Xiao Yan die in Yun Shan’s hand but she similarly did not wish to see Yun Shan be killed by Xiao Yan. However, at this moment, she could only quietly wait for the end of the battle below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You damn brat. It is really unexpected that this ancestor still underestimated you in the end…” Yun Shan’s expression was gloomy as his hand wiped over his robes and removed the fresh blood on it. After which, he raised his head and looked at Xiao Yan whose aura was a little sluggish. He spoke in a dense voice, “It is likely that the Dou Technique earlier is of quite a high class right? The Dou Qi it requires should also be extremely great. How many times can the current you use it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan wiped away the trace of blood from the corner of his mouth as he said faintly, “Enough to let you know what a serious injury is called…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that so?” Yun Shan laughed in a cold and dark manner as he said, “That earlier Dou Technique of yours might indeed have a great strength that even I dare not underestimate. However, I’m afraid that it is still a little lacking if you want to rely on it to kill a Dou Zong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan narrowed his eyes. His fist had also slowly tightened. Although Yun Shan’s words did indeed cause people to be irritated, it was also true. With his current strength, using this ‘Open Mountain Seal,’ which he was not very familiar with, to neutralize Yun Shan’s similarly extremely powerful attack was already quite outstanding. Unless Yun Shan simply stood there and forcefully received a blow without any defenses, trying to rely on this to defeat him in one go would likely be quite difficult…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan tightened his fist and his gaze also glanced at the battle situation at Yao Lao’s side. He involuntarily knit his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Yao Lao and that Protector Wu had basically descended into an unusually fiery hot stalemate. Both parties used all of their killing moves with many dangerous situations repeatedly appearing. However, they still maintained a strange equilibrium. No matter how they increased their strength, they still had difficulty causing the other party to feel any actual harm. From the looks of the situation, it may be said that Yao Lao had a faint advantage but Xiao Yan, who clearly understood Yao Lao, knew that due to him being a Spiritual Body, Yao Lao’s endurance was far inferior to an elite Dou Zong despite him possessing the strength to contend against one. Hence, this kind of stalemate was in reality not very beneficial to Yao Lao. Once that Protector Wu managed to take an opportunity when Yao Lao’s strength weakened, it was likely that a big change would appear in this battle…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slowly withdrew his gaze from the battleground. He once again looked at the chaotic big battleground in the distant. The fighting and killing there was even more chaotic and intense. There would frequently be some experts who fell from it with serious injuries, ending up with an unknown fate. The Misty Cloud Sect could be said to have sent out all their elites at this moment, going all out to block the sharp attacks by the experts from the alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s gaze swiftly swept over Hai Bodong and the couple of other people within the chaotic battleground. He let out a slight sigh of relief. It was fortunate that they were in an advantageous situation in this exchange between top level experts. It was likely that if they were given sufficient time, they would be able to defeat their opponents. At that time, once Hai Bodong and the other experts managed to free themselves, this chaotic battleground would begin to stabilize itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the movement of his gaze, Xiao Yan had also glanced at the area below the Misty Cloud Mountain. There was the faint sounds of killing being transmitted from there. It was likely that the one hundred thousand strong imperial army at the bottom of the mountain had begun their attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, killing and fighting had erupted in almost from every single spot of the Misty Cloud Mountain. This sect, which was usually quiet, was now completely covered in a terribly bloody storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s gaze swept all around once before it was swiftly withdrawn. He slowly exhaled a breath of air and his eyes flickered as he looked at Yun Shan in front of him, who showed a savage smile on the corner of his mouth. Xiao Yan lowered his gaze slightly and glanced at the dense white ring on his finger. After a brief moment of hesitation within his heart, Xiao Yan clenched his teeth violently. It was likely that he could only use this killing weapon if he really wanted to defeat Yun Shan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan made up his mind within his heart. He ceased hesitating as he moved his hand. A cluster of medicinal pills appeared in his hand before he stuffed them into his mouth and chewed with all his might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dou Qi exhausted by an ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ formed from the combination of two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’ was not any less than using the ‘Open Mountain Seal’. The Dou Qi that was required for the merger of three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ naturally increased by multiple times. Hence, the current him needed to go all out and enable the Dou Qi within his body to be maintained at a filled condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan gorged down the medicinal pills into his stomach but did not split his attention to refine them. Being in possession of a ‘Heavenly Flame’ like the ‘Glazed Lotus Core Flame’, he need not pay too much attention to the medicinal pills that he swallowed. The ‘Heavenly Flame’ would automatically refine them. Finally, they would transform into the purest Dou Qi that would flow into his spacious veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s face twitched a little as he looked at how Xiao Yan wildly ate the medicinal pills. Even though he was an elite Dou Zong, the medicinal pills which he had stashed away naturally would not exceed Xiao Yan’s rich collection. Hence, he could only open his eyes and watch Xiao Yan’s exhausted Dou Qi slowly recovered with the help of the medicinal pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it was naturally impossible for Yun Shan to foolishly wait for Xiao Yan to recover his Dou Qi. Hence, the moment that Xiao Yan swallowed those medicinal pills, his body moved abruptly and immediately appeared in front of Xiao Yan in a strange manner. His hand slashed at Xiao Yan’s throat. Under the cover of that deep-green Dou Qi, his fingernails were not any weaker than sharp blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s body leaned back slightly and Yun Shan’s hand was close to Xiao Yan’s neck as it sliced through the air. The dense, cold wind caused Xiao Yan’s skin to feel a chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silver glow flickered under Xiao Yan’s feet as his body leaned back. His body immediately rushed away. While he did so, he flicked his finger and the Heavy Xuan Ruler flashed and appeared. His feet violently kicked the ruler’s hilt and the heavy ruler carried a ferocious strength that shot toward Yun Shan who wanted to give chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy ruler that rushed over caused Yun Shan’s body to pause. He ruthlessly smashed his fist forward and sent the heavy ruler flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s finger shook just as Yun Shan sent the heavy ruler flying. The dense white colored ring burst apart and a cluster of fierce dense white flame swiftly surfaced in front of Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan tore apart the ‘Glazed Lotus Core Flame’ at the same time that he saw the dense white flame appear. The former turned into a cluster of green-colored flames and an invisible one. Soon after, Xiao Yan clapped his hands together without hesitating and the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ were pressed into the cluster of dense white-colored flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space around Xiao Yan began to ripple when the three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ made contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s expression changed drastically when he saw the actions of Xiao Yan. He could sense the three different colored flames in front of Xiao Yan were deriving an extremely frightening energy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s body instantly disappeared at almost the same time. He must interrupt this frightening attack by Xiao Yan. Otherwise...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan, who had transformed into a black shadow that rushed over, similarly caused Xiao Yan’s expression to change slightly. The blackish-green wings on his back were flapped. Both of his hands tightly held the cluster of three different colored flames, which were swiftly mixing, as his body swiftly withdrew. On top of dodging, Xiao Yan also flicked his finger and some jade bottles suddenly shot out from the storage ring. There was a palm-sized fire lotus within each of the jade bottles…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jade bottles flew out and immediately let out a chaotic explosive crackling sound, like a firecracker, at a spot that was not far from Yun Shan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough these small fire lotus were unable to cause much injuries to Yun Shan, they were indeed able to slow down his chasing speed. Hence, Xiao Yan had stopped his fleeing stance a short distance away when Yun Shan was breaking through the unceasing number of fire lotus explosions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s gaze slowly shifted away from Xiao Yan’s pale, weak face that carried some solemness before finally stopping on his hands. At this moment, Yun Shan suddenly shrank his eyes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan flapped the blackish-green wings on his back in the air. His face was pale-white as his breathing became unusually weary. A foot wide three different colored fire lotus was gently floating above his palm. A frighteningly wild and violent energy slowly seeped out, causing shock to surge up on the faces of everyone present!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-713\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-715\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-714","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
