I descended a narrow flight of steps to the basement. Not the big room in front where they have Bingo a couple nights a week, but a smaller room on the side where they have the meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you live in a neighborhood you know where different things are. Whether you have any interest in them or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in front of the door for a minute or two. I felt a little light-headed, a little congested in the chest. I decided that was probably from the brandy. It\u0027s a powerful stimulant. I\u0027m not used to it, don\u0027t drink it often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door and looked in. A couple dozen people sitting in folding chairs. A table holding a big coffee urn and a few stacks of Styrofoam cups. Some slogans taped to the wall-EASY DOES IT, KEEP IT SIMPLE. The fucking wisdom of the ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was probably in a room like this downtown. Some church basement in SoHo, say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest of luck, lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back, let the door shut, walked up the stairs. I had visions of the door opening behind me, people chasing after me and dragging me back. Nothing like that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tight feeling was still there in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brandy, I told myself. Probably be a good idea to stay away from it. Stick to what you\u0027re used to. Stick to bourbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went on over to Armstrong\u0027s. A little bourbon would take the edge off the brandy rush. A little bourbon would take the edge off almost anything. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-26.html","bookId":2322,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM"}
