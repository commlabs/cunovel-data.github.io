I\u0027ve been engaged to work afternoons, at five dollars a week.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who has engaged to pay you such high wages?” asked Mrs. Carter, astonished.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A young man staying at the hotel, whose eyes are weak. I am to read to him, and do whatever else he requires. I got the chance through the landlord.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are certainly fortunate,” said his mother, gratified.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, what I am going to propose to the squire is to wait two or three weeks for the balance of the interest till I can make it up out of my wages.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If he weren\u0027t so anxious to get possession of the place he would; but I am afraid on that account he will refuse But we ought to go in.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Carter removed the apron which she had worn about her work, and entered the sitting room, followed by Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope you will excuse my keeping you waiting, Squire Leech,” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly, ma\u0027am, though I am rather in a hurry.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you have come about the interest?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is due to-day, as, of course, you know.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you have it ready,” said the squire, eyeing her shrewdly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can pay you fifteen dollars of it,” said the widow, nervously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Squire Leech felt exultant, but he only frowned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It amounts to twenty-two dollars and a half,” he said, sharply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know that, and I shall be able to pay the remainder if you will be kind enough to wait two or three weeks.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not knowing anything of Herbert\u0027s good fortune, Squire Leech utterly disbelieved this. He knew no source from which the widow could get the money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is easy enough to make promises,” he said, with a sneer, “but that doesn\u0027t satisfy me. I want my money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Herbert felt it time for him to take part in the conversation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My mother can keep her promise,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can she? Perhaps you will explain where you expect to get the money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “From my wages,” answered Herbert, proudly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wasn\u0027t aware that you received any,” sneered the squire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have just made an engagement to work for five dollars a week,” said our hero, enjoying the squire\u0027s look of surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Indeed! Who pays you that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A gentleman boarding at the hotel has engaged me to read to him as his eyes are weak.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A fool and his money are soon parted,” said Squire Leech. “You may retain the position a week.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope to keep it. I feel sure that I shall.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t,” said the squire, emphatically.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then are you willing to wait—say two weeks—for the rest of the interest?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I am not, and you ought to have known I shouldn\u0027t be. There is a way of arranging the whole matter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By selling the place, you mean?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; I mean just that. It is folly for you to think of keeping the property with such a heavy mortgage upon it on which you are unable to pay the interest. I have offered you a fair price for it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You offered four hundred dollars less than it cost.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is nonsense! It never cost fifteen hundred dollars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have my husband\u0027s word for it,” said the widow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then, he made some mistake, you may be sure.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sure father was right,” said Herbert. “Besides, we have his bills to prove it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s neither here nor there,” said Squire Leech, impatiently. “Even if it cost ten thousand dollars, it\u0027s only worth eleven hundred now; that is to say, three hundred and fifty dollars over and above the mortgage.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are hard upon me, Squire Leech,” said Mrs. Carter, despondently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are a woman, ma\u0027am, and women never understand business. I make allowance for you; but your son ought to know better than to encourage you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I want my mother to be treated fairly and justly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you mean to imply that I would treat her otherwise, young man?” demanded the squire, angrily. “I advise you not to make an enemy of me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert looked sober. The squire might not be right but certainly he had the power to carry his point and that power he was certain to exercise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you give my mother and myself a little time to consult what is to be done?” he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said the squire, feeling that he had carried his point. “I might refuse, of course, but I wish to be easy with you and therefore I will give you till half past twelve. I will be back at that time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took his cane and left the house.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His reference to the post office reminded Herbert of the letter he had in his pocket for his mother.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here\u0027s a letter for you, mother,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A letter! Who can it be from?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s postmarked at Randolph,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps it\u0027s from Aunt Nancy,” suggested the widow. “I don\u0027t know anyone else in Randolph that would be likely to write to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She opened the envelope and uttered a cry of surprise as two bills dropped out and fluttered to the floor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert picked them up eagerly and cried: “Why, mother, they are ten-dollar bills. Twenty dollars in all!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Twenty dollars!” repeated Mrs. Carter, in amazement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hurrah! now we can pay the interest!” exclaimed Herbert. “Won\u0027t the squire be mad!” and he laughed joyously. “Read the letter aloud, mother.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Carter read as follows:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “MY DEAR NIECE: I have thought of you often, and wish we were not so far distant from each other. I should enjoy seeing you and that good son of yours often. I am afraid you have had a hard time getting along. My wants are few and I have more than enough to supply them. I inclose twenty dollars in this letter. I shall not need them, for an old woman like me can live on very little.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish you would write to me sometimes or ask Herbert to. I feel lonely and it would be a great favor to me. If it were not so far, I would ask you and Herbert to come over and spend a day or two with me. Perhaps you can manage to do it some time. Only don\u0027t delay too long, for I am getting old and can\u0027t expect to live much longer,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your affectionate aunt,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “NANCY CARTER.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How good of Aunt Nancy! If her brother had possessed her kind heart, we should be better off to-day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It came just in the nick of time, mother. How lucky!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say, rather, how providential, my son. We owe to the kindness of God. He will not see us want.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course you are right, mother; but the squire won\u0027t regard it in the same light. He will be terribly disappointed, for he thinks he has got us in his power.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am thankful that this is to be our home for six months more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Longer than that, mother. I am earning something now, and I will save up money to pay our next interest.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Squire Leech is coming back,” said Mrs. Carter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “See how briskly he walks!” said Herbert. “I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be so cheerful when he leaves the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t think we ought to exult, Herbert.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can\u0027t help it, mother and I\u0027m not ashamed of it, either. You are carrying benevolence too far.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here the squire\u0027s knock was heard, and Herbert went to admit him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82057.html","bookId":346,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:05:13 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 1:35:31 PM"}
