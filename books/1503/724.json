As he did so, he began to scan and observe his surroundings.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn this deep valley, the aura was rather dank and gloomy, even the surrounding rocks were black, as sunlight was unable to shine directly into the valley. The entire valley seemed void of vegetation, only surrounded by jagged rocks of grotesque shapes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing discovered that in this valley, there were two Attributes which were the most vibrant and lively, both of which he was extremely familiar with. The sheer thickness of the two was almost equal to that of the Lustre Spatial Realm when the mother dragon Duo Si had been driven insane and was unleashing Fire Attribute energies without restraint. The two Attributes currently was that of the Darkness and Demonic attributes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIndeed, there was actually a large amount of natural Demonic Attribute present. Although it was extremely mixed and impure, it was still such a rare sight, one that Zhou Weiqing had never witnessed before.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough the terrain was extremely rough, it could not affect the powerhouses of the XuanTian Palace, and their speed of advancement was extremely quick. As they advanced deeper, following Dreamwake and the XuanTian Palace Master’s lead, the Darkness and Demonic Attributes grew even stronger and livelier.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll of a sudden, Dreamwake stopped in her tracks, allowing the four Grand Elders to overtake her, returning to Zhou Weiqing’s side. However, the usual faint smile on her face was no longer present, left with a stern and chilly manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Err….

The four Grand Elders arranged in a single file behind him, while Dreamwake actually brought Zhou Weiqing to the front to stand beside Dong Fang.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRight in front where the terrain flattened out, there was a thick black mist covering the entire area. If they entered the mist, Zhou Weiqing did not doubt that they would not be able to even see their own fingers if they waved their hands in front of themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs they reached this spot, both the Darkness and Demonic Attribute energies were clearly even stronger, and purer. However, they did not seem to be purer individually, instead somehow fused together while becoming purer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTenebrous Attribute?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s heart jerked in sudden realisation, as he instantly thought about what Dreamwake had described to him previously. That important personage living here that they were here to visit should definitely be well versed in this Tenebrous Attribute. Of course, for all of the XuanTian Palace powerhouses to place such importance on him, one could just imagine what his cultivation level was at.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe XuanTian Palace Master looked at Dreamwake, who nodded at him. With a flip of her wrists, a large black crystal appeared in her hands, giving a stark visual contrast to her small tender white hands.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith a flick of her wrists, black light began shining brightly, and in a flash the crystal flew right into the black mist.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing turned to look at the four Grand Elders and Nie Han behind them, discovering that they all had a respectful expression on their faces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNot much time had passed when abruptly, a fierce pressure exploded from the black mist, filled with a bitter cold, filling the entire area at once. The thick black mist billowed out furiously towards all of them. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Do not move.” Dreamwake’s voice rang out in Zhou Weiqing’s ears. In the next moment, the thick black mist had already enveloped all eight of them. Only then did Zhou Weiqing understand why Dreamwake had asked him not to leave her side in the radius of five metres. In that radius, the aura around Dreamwake’s body actually isolated them from everything happening outside.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe had just treated her in such a fashion, but she was still concerned about his safety. Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel the favourable impression in his heart towards her increase greatly. Of course, towards such a beauty, his favourable impression was always there...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe thick black mist spread all around the air, the entire surrounding was obscured even for their vision. Since he was in Dreamwake’s aura, Zhou Weiqing dared not extend his senses, though he was fully focused and wary. Vaguely, there seemed to be an aura influencing his bloodlines within the thick black mist, making him feel like his blood was boiling and ready to fight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What is it?” A low, melodic yet magnetic male voice rang out from all directions. The terrifying aura that even the XuanTian Palace powerhouses had to be careful of also disappeared at the same time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe XuanTian Palace Master said respectfully: “Sir, along the west coastal seas, a Terror Sea Dragon has recently been appearing in the area. It has caused much destruction to our ships, and seems to be specially targeting us, lingering around the area without moving back.

As such, we managed to work together to kill it. Even so, we had paid a heavy price. In the world today, the Terror Sea Dragon is one of the most powerful of the Dragon Tribe still alive, its core bloodline is a legacy that is second only to that of the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines, an existence that can reach the Mid Level Heavenly God Tier. More importantly, when it is In the oceans, it is able to borrow the powers of the oceans.

With just my strength alone, it will be difficult to chase it away. If this Terror Sea Dragon is really here to target you all, then it must have some close connection with the one we killed a long time ago.

More importantly, each time it can only sustain the teleporting of ten life forms or less. If we are only injuring the Terror Sea Dragon, it is not worth using it. But… if we can kill it, then it will be worthwhile. Alright.. Fine… even if I have to risk sustaining severe injuries, I will accompany you all.
