I\u0027d never known that Gilly had gotten married. I\u0027d never known she\u0027d had a child. I\u0027d never dreamed that child\u0027s last name was \"McHenry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all this time I thought I was a Gallagher legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Macey McHenry wants to come here,\" Mom said, \"we\u0027ll find a place for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and started to leave, but Liz called after her, \"But, ma\u0027am, how\u0027s she gonna…you know … catch up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom considered this to be a fair question, because she folded her hands and said, \"I admit that, academically, Ms. McHenry will be behind the rest of the sophomore class. For that reason, she will be taking many of her courses with our younger students.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex grinned at me, but even the thought of Macey\u0027s supermodel legs stretching her high above a class full of newbies couldn\u0027t change the fact that two guys with bald heads (that may or may not have prices on them) were at that very moment making room for her in our suite. The question on my mother\u0027s face was whether we would make room for her in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my best friends, knowing that our mission, should we choose to accept it, was to befriend Macey McHenry. The good girl inside of me knew that I should at least try to help her fit in. The spy in me knew I\u0027d been given an assignment, and if I ever wanted to see Sublevel Two, I\u0027d better grin and say \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" The daughter in me knew there wasn\u0027t any choosing involved here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When does she start?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Sunday night I met Mom in her office for Tater Tots and chicken nuggets. We had one hard-and-fast rule about Sunday night suppers—Mom had to make them herself, which is nice and all, but not exactly good for my digestion. (Dad always said the most lethal thing about her was her cooking.) Directly beneath us, my friends were dining on the finest foods a five-star chef could offer, but as my mom walked around in an old sweatshirt of my dad\u0027s, looking like a teenager herself, I wouldn\u0027t have traded places with them for all the crème brûlée in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first came to the Gallagher Academy, I felt guilty about being able to see my mother every day when my classmates had to go months on end without their parents. Eventually, I stopped feeling bad about it. After all, Mom and I don\u0027t have summers together. But mostly, we don\u0027t have Dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how\u0027s school?\" She always asked as if she didn\u0027t know—and maybe she didn\u0027t. Maybe, just like every good operative, she wanted to hear all sides of the story before making up her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dipped a Tater Tot in some honey mustard dressing and said, \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s CoveOps?\" the mother asked, but I knew the headmistress was in there somewhere, and she wanted to know if her newest staff member was making the grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows about Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know where the sentence came from or why I spoke it. I\u0027d spent six days dreading Macey McHenry\u0027s arrival into our little society, but that was what I said when I finally had my mother alone? I studied her, wishing Mr. Solomon would have covered Reading Body Language that week instead of Basic Surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are people in this world, Cam—people like Mr. Solomon—who are going to know what happened to him. It\u0027s their job to know what happened. I hope someday you\u0027ll get used to the look in people\u0027s eyes as they put two and two together and try to decide whether or not to mention it. Am I right to assume Mr. Solomon mentioned it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how did you handle it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t yelled, and I hadn\u0027t cried, so I told my mother, \"Okay, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" She smoothed my hair, and I wondered for the millionth time if she had one set of hands for work and another for moments like this. I imagined her keeping them in a briefcase and swapping them out, silk for steel. Dr. Fibs could have made them—but he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m proud of you, kiddo,\" she said simply. \"It\u0027ll get easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom\u0027s the best spy I know—so I believed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we woke up the next morning, I remembered that it was Monday. I forgot that it was The Monday. That\u0027s why I stopped cold on my way into breakfast when I heard Buckingham\u0027s powerful \"Cameron Morgan!\" echo through the foyer. \"I\u0027ll need you and Ms. Baxter and Ms. Sutton to follow me, please.\" Bex and Liz looked as lost as I felt, until Buckingham explained, \"Your new roommate has arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuckingham was pretty old, and we did have her outnumbered three-to-one, but still I didn\u0027t see many alternatives. We followed her up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it would just be Mom and Macey in her office—Macey\u0027s parents having already been sent away in the limo if they\u0027d bothered coming at all (which they hadn\u0027t)—but when Buckingham threw open the door I saw Mr. Solomon and Jessica Boden sharing the leather couch. He looked so completely bored I almost felt sorry for him, and Jessica was perched eagerly on the edge of the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guest of honor was seated across the desk from my mother, wearing an official uniform but looking like a supermodel. She didn\u0027t even turn around when we walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I was saying, Macey,\" my mom said, once Liz, Bex, and I had positioned ourselves in the window seat at the far side of the room while Buckingham stood at attention in front of the bookshelves, \"I hope you\u0027ll be happy here at the Gallagher Academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I know heiress isn\u0027t one of the languages I speak, but I\u0027m pretty sure that translates into Tell it to someone who cares because I\u0027ve heard it all before, and you\u0027re only saying that because my father wrote you an enormous check. (But that\u0027s just a guess.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Macey,\" an utterly repulsive voice chimed. I\u0027m not sure why I hate Jessica Boden, but I\u0027m pretty sure it has something to do with the fact that her posture is way too up-and-down, and I don\u0027t trust someone who doesn\u0027t know how to properly slouch. \"When the trustees heard about your admittance, my mother—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Jessica.\" How much do I love my mother? Very much. Mom opened a thick file that lay on her desk. \"Macey, I see here that you spent a semester at the Triad Academy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Macey said. (Now, there\u0027s a girl who knows how to slouch.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then a full year at Wellington House. Two months at Ingalls. Ooh, just a week at the Wilder Institute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a point?\" Macey asked, her tone just as sharp as the letter opener-slash-dagger that Joe Solomon had been absentmindedly fingering while they spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen a lot of different schools, Macey—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t say there was anything different about them,\" she shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no sooner had the words left her mouth than the letter-opening dagger went slicing through the air, no more than a foot away from her glossy hair, flying from Mr. Solomon\u0027s hand directly toward Buckingham\u0027s head. It all happened so fast—like blink-or-you\u0027ll-miss-it fast. One second Macey was talking about how all prep schools are the same, and the next, Patricia Buckingham was grabbing a copy of War and Peace from the bookshelf behind her and holding it inches from her face just as the dagger pierced its leather cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time, the only sound was the subtle vibration of the letter opener as it stuck out of the book, humming like a tuning fork looking for middle C. Then my mom leaned onto her desk and said, \"I think you\u0027ll find there are some things we teach that your other schools haven\u0027t offered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What…\" Macey stammered. \"What… What… Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when my mom went through the school history again—the unabridged version—starting with Gilly and then hitting highlights like how it was Gallagher Girls giving each other manicures who had figured out the whole no-two-fingerprints-alike thing, and a few of our more highly profitable creations. (Duct tape didn\u0027t invent itself, you know.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mom finished, Bex said, \"Welcome to spy school,\" in her real accent instead of the geographically neutral drawl, which is all Macey had heard until then, and I could tell she was about to go into serious information overload, which, of course, wasn\u0027t helped by Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macey, I know this is going to come as a big adjustment to you, but that\u0027s why my mother—she\u0027s a Gallagher Trustee—has encouraged me to help you through this—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Jessica,\" Mom said, cutting her off yet again. \"Perhaps I can make things a little more clear.\" Mom reached into her pocket and pulled out what looked like an ordinary silver compact. She flipped up the lid and touched her forefinger to mirror inside. I saw the small light scan her fingerprint, and when she snapped the compact closed, the world around Macey McHenry shifted as the whole Code Red process went into reverse. The bookshelves had been facing wrong-way-out for a week, but now they were spinning around to show their true side. Disney World disappeared in the photo on Mom\u0027s desk; and Liz broke out her Portuguese long enough to say, \"Sera que ela vai vomitar?\" But I had to shake my head in response because I honestly didn\u0027t know whether or not Macey was going to throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everything stopped spinning (literally) Macey was surrounded by more than a hundred years of covert secrets, but she wasn\u0027t stopping to take it all in. Instead, she screamed, \"You people are psycho!\" and bolted for the door. Unfortunately, Joe Solomon was one step ahead of her. \"Get out of my way!\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said coolly. \"I don\u0027t believe the headmistress is finished quite yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macey.\" My mom\u0027s voice was calm and full of reason. \"I know this must come as quite a shock to you. But we\u0027re really just a school for exceptional young women. Our classes are hard. Our curriculum unique. But you may use what you learn here anywhere in the world. In any way you see fit.\" Mom\u0027s eyes narrowed. Her voice hardened as she said, \"If you stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mom stepped forward, I knew she wasn\u0027t talking as an administrator anymore; she was talking as a mother. \"If you want to leave, Macey, we can make you forget this ever happened. When you wake up tomorrow, this will be a dream you don\u0027t remember, and you\u0027ll have one more dismal school experience on your record. But no matter your decision, there is only one thing you have to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom was moving closer, and Macey snapped, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will ever know what you have seen and heard here today.\" Macey was still staring daggers, but my mom didn\u0027t have a copy of War and Peace handy, so she reached for the next best thing. \"Especially your parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just when I\u0027d thought I\u0027d never see Macey McHenry smile…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the third week of school, my backpack was heavier than me (well, maybe not me, but probably Liz), I had a mountain of homework, and the sign above the Grand Hall was announcing that we\u0027d all better dust off our French if we intended to make small talk over lunch. Plus, it was almost a full-time job keeping rumors separated from facts. (No big surprise who the rumors were all about.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey McHenry had gotten kicked out of her last school because she was pregnant with the headmaster\u0027s baby. RUMOR. At her first P\u0026amp;E class, Macey kicked a seventh grader so hard she was out cold for an hour. FACT. (And also the reason Macey\u0027s now taking P\u0026amp;E with the eighth graders.) Macey told a seventh grader that her glasses make her face look fat, a senior that her hair looks like a wig (which it is, thanks to a very unfortunate plutonium incident), and Professor Buckingham that she really should try control-top panty hose. FACT. FACT. FACT. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-6.html","bookId":2746,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM"}
