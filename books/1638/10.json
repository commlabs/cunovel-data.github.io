Koida \u0027Vadam. Thel felt the faint kick of disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny of these elders could have sired Thel. It was not the Sangheili way to let a child know its father, as Sangheili took sires based on their fighting prowess. Sangheili only truly could know who their mothers\u0027 brothers were, and so were raised by their uncles to learn the fighting arts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of these elders had once been great warriors. And several of Thel\u0027s uncles sat before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoida, thankfully, was not one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Thel \u0027Vadamee.\" Thel stressed the \"ee\" that signified his military service. \"If you voted me for kaidon, surely you knew I could defend myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoida leaned forward, his wrinkled hands on the table before him to steady himself. \"You have spent your last years fighting the lesser races of the Covenant, not Sangheili. I feared you had weakened, and would not make a strong kaidon of the keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel shook his head. \"The only ones who grow soft, it seems, are elders who cluster in their small rooms, plotting against their kaidon. Had you been strong, you would have waited in my room to attack me yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elders murmured agreement, and Thel walked around the table, grabbed Koida\u0027s cloak, and pulled him up from his chair. He pushed him toward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe nearest massive wall, where the Vadam Saga stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are the words of our lineage, Koida,\" Thel said. \"Where is your name on that wall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoida shook his head sadly, his wrinkled, faded brown skin bunching as he did so. \"It is not on the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We Sangheili are only as good as our deeds. We are born and live in the common rooms, beginning life equal to each other in the eyes of the keep, and rise according to our ability. You should have voted against me and stood your ground, or killed me yourself. Your cowardice is not a trait I want spread through the lineage of Vadam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoida\u0027s eyes widened fully. \"I will fall on my sword, kaidon, but please do not revoke the blood of my line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not quench it,\" Thel said. \"You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoida leapt forward, suddenly finding courage, and Thel pulled his energy sword out. The blue plasma leapt out, and Thel swung the blade through Koida\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elder\u0027s head rolled across the floor, and purple blood gushed out, splattering the Saga\u0027s chiseled words. It was the closest the elder would get to having any part of himself on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel turned to his guards. \"The Koida line shall leave. They are no longer Vadam. They have until sunrise to do so. Any of Koida\u0027s line still here after that will meet the same fate as he did. I grant them mercy, because Koida at least found his spirit right before death. Had he taken a knee and begged, they would all be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is our honor,\" the guards said, and left to spread the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel turned back to the elders. \"I have been looking over the state of Vadam.\" The harbor brought in profits, the buildings reached from the valley under the keep out across the land, and Vadam\u0027s serfs were happy and working hard, hoping to rise and distinguish themselves and gain a position in the keep. \"I am happy with your guidance. The lineage is strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vadam is strong,\" an elder agreed, perhaps hoping to gain favor and notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am no figurehead,\" Thel continued, ignoring the interruption for the moment. \"I will take a close interest in all our investments and activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who work for only their own gain, and not that of Vadam, risk my wrath. Am I understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all did. \"Yes, kaidon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Thel flicked the energy sword off, and slid the handle into the depths of his cloak. \"You were right to elect me kaidon. I have news for you. I have been given a promotion, and command of a ship that is part of a fleet created by a High Prophet himself. We have discovered a new human\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We pity the poor creatures who are about to be destroyed by your mighty hand,\" one elder said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the name of this world?\" Another asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The humans call it Charybdis IX. I leave you all now in stewardship of Vadam.\" Thel eyed the elders. \"I hope it is in the most capable hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all rushed to reassure the new kaidon that, indeed, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter TEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNSC FRIGATE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMIDSUMMER NIGHT,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOUTER FRINGES, ECTANUS 45 SYSTEM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes walked into the chart room of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole bridge crew sat around the tabletop chart, nodding as he entered. His fellow junior officers were all here: Lieutenant Badia Campbell ran ops, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Rai Li on weapons, and Lieutenant Dante Kirtley ran communications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard you got hit pretty hard, Keyes.\" Badia Campbell looked up from her notes. The jovial note in her voice sounded slightly forced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piece of deck plate had slammed into Keyes while he floated toward the ship, but he had waved on the medics that had been sent to pick him up --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe thought the others needed it more. The explosion had killed some twenty Helljumpers. And although the container with the wounded had been badly damaged, it had been recovered, and many survived. Other Helljumpers had been concussed, or suffered internal bleeding and injuries from their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eproximity to the Shockwave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut more people had made it out than Keyes initially had even hoped for. And many were treating him with a newfound respect, something above and beyond just his rank and his reputation of being well learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that added respect included the bridge crew all around the chart table looking up at him. Keyes hadn\u0027t had much time in the first forty-eight hours to get to know them. They\u0027d all been running around, checking on repairs and trying to figure out why things weren\u0027t working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the bridge all three of his fellow officers had been crisp, together, and on top of things ... though Campbell sounded tired and a bit short-tempered with the people reporting to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes would\u0027ve been too. Ops was taking the brunt of the work to get things running smoothly. \"Minor head wound,\" Keyes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRai Li smiled. \"I personally think your skull\u0027s too thick for debris to get through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all laughed, breaking the ice. This was the first time they\u0027d all sat in a room together. They\u0027d been busy with their duties, and then reporting to Zheng, who had been very hands-off so far with the crew, trusting only his officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hadn\u0027t sat well, a lot of nervous crew wondered why Zheng had been given a ship after sacrificing his last one in a suicidal dash. They whispered that he\u0027d been caught sitting in the captain\u0027s chair, staring out at space, crying silently to himself. Everyone tiptoed around the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shakedown problems didn\u0027t leave a lot of time to size each other up. But the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinnegan\u0027s Wake incident had now run them through a critical event, and everyone aboard had stopped bickering over petty things. The ship seemed to have pulled together. After the somberness of the past twenty-four hours, it was nice to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should have seen Kirtley\u0027s face when Zheng hailed you and you answered. He was knee-deep in his console, upside down, no less, trying to figure out if something had gone wrong with our equipment,\" Campbell said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027ve had so little luck on equipment so far.\" Kirtley shook his head. \"I know we need to refit and build these ships as fast as possible to face the Covenant, but we need to be a little bit more careful about build quality ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Commander Zheng walked in, Major Akio Watanabe close behind. They all stood to attention, but Zheng waved his hand. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexuberant mood the officers had shared died. Even they were beginning to be affected by Zheng\u0027s reputation. They only interacted with him formally, as they were now. It made him hard to gauge. And Keyes\u0027s efforts to talk to the commander had been rebuffed with the hasty excuse of being too busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you were,\" Zheng said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat back down. Except Watanabe, who held onto a small box and continued to stand behind Zheng. If Zheng was standoffish, Keyes thought, then Watanabe here was almost as mysterious, staying in his room alone for most of the trip so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to have you back, Lieutenant Keyes,\" Zheng said. \"We dodged quite a bullet, there. The ship owes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir,\" Keyes ducked his head, somewhat embarrassed at the attention. This was wildly outgoing for Zheng. \"What about the captured Innie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHas he talked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned to Watanabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he has admitted to being an Insurrectionist, yes.\" Watanabe looked down, as if in thought. \"I haven\u0027t gotten much else out of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirtley murmured, \"I\u0027d hate to be that guy right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatanabe snapped his head up and stared at the two of them. \"Mr. Dante Kirtley ... do you think I brought aboard a portable torture chamber?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirtley didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know we\u0027re the boogeymen,\" Watanabe continued. \"But don\u0027t be ridiculous. You torture a man, he\u0027ll tell you anything to make it stop. Anything you think you want. He might even, if you\u0027re pushing hard enough, believe whatever that is with all the will that he has left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAkio Watanabe unbuttoned the top of his sleeves. He pulled them back to reveal scars running from his wrists all the way up to his elbows. A fast unclip of his odd, high-necked collar revealed horrible scarring around his throat. \"If I tortured them, I\u0027d be no better than them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down and rebuttoned his uniform slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Kirtley started to say, but Watanabe cut him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m overloyal to the Prowler Corps, and by extension, the UNSC, it is because they rescued me from hell itself. Now, let\u0027s not ever talk about this again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, sir,\" Keyes said, eager to get everyone past it. \"So no information out of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadly, not much. The Insurrectionists use cell tactics, and the man we captured doesn\u0027t know too much other than the details of this mission. I\u0027m using a mild sedative to relax him, and a lie detector he doesn\u0027t know about. So I\u0027m just chatting with him. With the detector and random conversation for calibration, we may yet learn something, but don\u0027t get too hopeful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRai Li shook her head. \"Doesn\u0027t make sense, what they did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Watanabe cocked his head. \"We\u0027ve just ordered that there be no more non-Navy travel. They can\u0027t resupply each other, they have no communications ability. They\u0027re isolated. We\u0027ve incidentally dealt the Insurrectionists all across the colonies a killing blow, as a complete sidenote to the war against the Covenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have done this years ago, then,\" Kirtley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of martial civilization would we be where civilians weren\u0027t allowed to travel unless by the military, where all communications between worlds were controlled by us?\" Watanabe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d be a functional one, without uprisings. Orderly.\" It seemed obvious to Kirtley. Keyes had to admit he agreed somewhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" Watanabe shrugged. \"Maybe. At first. But don\u0027t forget, these Insurrectionists knew what frequency to jam. They have sympathizers in the UNSC, they could be anywhere. It isn\u0027t as simple as killing this or cutting that. People facing an invasion, no matter what we\u0027d like to believe, behave in a variety of different ways. Some ready for battle, some try to bargain, others look to what advantages they can gain in the short term, and old wounds still run deep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the meantime,\" Commander Zheng said, \"we need to focus on the next leg of our mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatanabe held out the box. \"And now it is time to unseal our orders. Commander Zheng, your thumbprint please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng pressed his thumb against the screen. Then Watanabe did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pad lit up, and Watanabe handed it over to Zheng, who read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to brief them, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng looked up with a frown. \"You know the particulars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the one who suggested this operation.\" Watanabe steepled his fingers together. \"It\u0027s a situation I\u0027ve been following for a while now. We haven\u0027t had the resources, until I became aware of this ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go ahead, Mr. Watanabe. It\u0027s your show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"During my ... recovery,\" Watanabe started, \"I was on loan from the Prowler Corps to the data gathering and analysis section of a certain ONI branch that I\u0027m not at liberty to name. It was there I started coming across reports of Covenant weaponry turning up in civilian hands throughout the colonies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that isn\u0027t unusual.\" Campbell leaned forward. \"Marines who\u0027ve tangled with Covenant forces bring them back. They can hock them on the black market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatanabe unfolded his hands and leaned back in his chair. \"That\u0027s true. But according to regulations you\u0027re supposed to turn them in to ONI, and not everyone is so ... rules bound. With the Cole Protocol being rolled out, you\u0027ll note that bringing a Covenant weapon back to any UNSC installation or Inner Colony location is an act of treason under one of the attached sub-articles. They might not be weapons, but drones, or bombs, or have beacons in them that will let the Covenant map our locations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll have a chilling effect on the pawn shops near military bases,\" Li said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strained smile quirked on Watanabe\u0027s lips. \"One imagines. However, I\u0027m not talking about the usual levels of black market collectibles. Until the Cole Protocol was put in place, we saw a dramatic increase in Covenant weaponry flooding the market. My fellow analysts and I came to believe that somewhere out there, Insurrectionists or other parties may actually be trading with the Covenant. Or, alternatively, they are being co-opted by the Covenant somehow, instead of merely being destroyed.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-10.html","bookId":1638,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM"}
