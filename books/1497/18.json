Then, he, along with Xun Er, lazily walked out of the hall while chatting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brat, just wait. When you get kicked out of the clan, I’ll have all the time in the world for revenge! Without the clan leader’s protection, you are nothing!” Watching the disappearing Xiao Yan, Xiao Ning felt a fury burn in his chest. As if to show his dedication, he smacked the bookshelf next to him, leaving a light handprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving the Dou Technique Hall, Xiao Yan first accompanied Xun Er to nearby mountains for an entire afternoon before going back to his room when the sky turned dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting back to his room and closing the door, Xiao Yan’s shoulders sagged down. After placing his scroll on a nearby table and drinking a cup of tea he fearfully said: “This girl, she sure can walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That girl’s history isn’t normal either.” An old voice resounded through the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiredly raising his head and seeing the ghost-like Yao Lao, Xiao Yan curled his lips and asked: “Does teacher know her history?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, I think I know a bit…” Yao Lao smiled but when he saw Xiao Yan’s curious glance, he said: “Don’t ask. It’s useless to you right now. So, it’s better if you don’t waste your effort on it. What I can say is that her background is pretty powerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling his eyes, Xiao Yan gave Yao Lao a middle finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you go get this trash? Do you think that you have a lot of time?” Yao Lao came to the table and flipped through the scroll, only to be appalled by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trash?” Xiao Yan cried out: “Besides Vacuum Hand, I don’t know any other Dou Techniques. Before, I only knew to train restlessly and didn’t know any Dou Techniques and only the Huang Level Dou Techniques can be learned by anyone in the clan. If I don’t learn these, what would I use to defeat others in the Coming of Age Ritual?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ohh, so you want to swindle a Dou Technique from me…” The shrewd Yao Lao understood Xiao Yan’s intent immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Xiao Yan had his plan exposed, he didn’t pretend as if that wasn’t his plan and instead looked at Yao Lao with puppy eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s so great about Dou Techniques? Once you learn Alchemy, people will be fighting to gift you high level Dou Techniques!” Yao Lao lightly smiled and ignored the ever darkening face of Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I need high level Dou Techniques, Right Now!” Xiao Yan said depressedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the sad Xiao Yan, Yao Lao laughed cheerfully: “Whatever, after all you are my student, although somewhat pitiful. So that you don’t become a cripple, I’ll teach you something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing that, Xiao Yan perked up; he was very curious as to what kind of Dou Technique his mysterious teacher would give him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though your vacuum hand is Xuan level, its somewhat weak for a technique at that level. Since your Dou Qi isn’t too strong right now, I’ll teach you a Dou Technique that’s at the Xuan level but only needs for you to be at 5 Duan Qi to be useful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What tier in the Xuan level?” Hearing that the technique was another Xuan level Dou Techniques, the eyes of Xiao Yan lit up and he asked while licking his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it was Xuan High level. I remember that the owner of this Dou Technique begged me to accept it. Even though I didn’t have much interest in such things, he was really persistent so I accepted and made a pill for him.” Yao Lao carelessly said. His casual mentionings made the Xuan level Dou Technique seem like trash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xuan High level? Begging to give you it?” A few black lines appeared on the forehead of Xiao Yan. The technique that was a whole tier higher than the top Dou Technique in the entire Xiao Clan was worthless in the eyes of Yao Lao! Xiao Yan didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the huge difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Close your eyes and focus, I’ll teach it to you.” After ordering Xiao Yan, Yao Lao stretched out his finger and lightly tapped Xiao Yan’s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a slight headache, Xiao Yan felt a huge amount of information flood into his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Octane Blast: Xuan High Level Dou Technique, close-combat Dou Technique. Focus’ on attacks and when mastered, attacks have eight different forces that stack up and the power is equal to a Di Low level Dou Technique!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly regaining his senses and quickly skimming over the new information, Xiao Yan let out a breath, the attack is equal to a Di Low level Dou Technique?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Dou Qi Mainland, whether its a Dou Technique or a Qi Method, the difference between a Xuan level technique and a Di level technique was enormous. The Di level technique would be on a completely different level and yet this Octane Blast claims that it can rival a Di level technique with its attack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing dryly, Xiao Yan’s eyes became blank. If I really learn this Dou Technique then I can probably beat up Xiao Ning with my 4 Duan Qi…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be too greedy. Even though Octane Blast doesn’t have high requirements of one’s Dou Qi, it has a huge toll on the body. This technique is a close combat Dou Technique and with your weak arms and legs, if you really try to use it, you’ll probably end up with broken limbs before you even touch your opponent.” Yao Lao’s voice was like a bowl of cold water and washed away Xiao Yan’s excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How would I increase the strength of my body?” After pausing, Xiao Yan hurriedly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Raising Dou Qi is the best way to increase the strength of one’s body. With higher Dou Qi, the body will become stronger. Of course, if you want to go faster, than you would need some external stimulus.” Yao Lao’s eyes twinkled with mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What external stimulus?” Watching the smiling Yao Lao, Xiao Yan suddenly felt a great danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get beat up! The more you get beat up, the better!” Yao Lao had a cold laugh while Xiao Yao had a stiff face…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-17\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-19\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-18","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM"}
