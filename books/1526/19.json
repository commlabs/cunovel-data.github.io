Looking for ways to hasten our passage, avoid needless delays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bullshit, Dennis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped at her words, his back taut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dennis,\" she said, \"I know why you\u0027re down here. I know about your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Blakely told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter who told me,\" she said. \"What matters is that your drive to find Harry is hurting this mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed even more. \"I don\u0027t see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. That\u0027s why I\u0027m bringing it up. Someone needs to tell you. You\u0027re thinking with your gut, not your head. You\u0027re racing past clues-like the dented cup, for instance. You\u0027re flying ahead of the rest of the team. Alone. Which is risky enough to yourself, but now you\u0027ve put another team member in harm\u0027s way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed his shoulders and lowered his voice. \"But I have to find my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley placed a consoling hand on his shoulder; he flinched from her touch. \"We\u0027ll find him. But we work as a team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood silently for several heartbeats, then took an awkward step forward, breaking the moment, clearing his throat. \"We\u0027re almost to the river. It\u0027s just up ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head, Ashley followed Michaelson around the next boulder. The path became more difficult as they approached the roaring river. The last yards to the river were blocked by a cluster of cave pearls, forcing them to crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovered in mud, they finally reached the river\u0027s edge. Below, black water churned between steep banks. Its spray, rich with salt, stung their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley wiped mud off her forehead with a damp handkerchief and leaned close to Michaelson, yelling directly in his ear, trying to outshout the river below. \"He wouldn\u0027t have tried to cross this river alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson nodded. \"Maybe Ben and Villanueva are having better luck,\" he hollered. \"Why don\u0027t we-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream pierced the roar of the river, echoing through the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, Michaelson and Ashley stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\" she hollered. \"It sounded like it came from across the river!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson tried to bore his light through the river\u0027s mist. \"It could just be an echo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this. Let\u0027s get everybody back together.\" She turned to trace their route back when a second scream erupted. It cut off abruptly. \"We\u0027d better hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson stood, his light fixed on the darkness beyond the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley grit her teeth. She yanked on his arm. \"Now, soldier. We\u0027re out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen scratched behind his left ear. What was taking Ashley and Michaelson\u0027s team so long? He and Villanueva had completed their leg of the search fifteen minutes ago. The SEAL had set an intense pace. Ben had always considered himself to be in decent shape, but as he struggled to keep up with Villanueva, he felt like someone\u0027s arthritic grandmother. His contribution to the search consisted mostly of him yelling for the SEAL to slow down. Still, for all their effort, they found no sign of Halloway, arriving back at the wormhole with no new information for Linda and Khalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen glanced toward Villanueva. The SEAL paced back and forth, one hand on a holstered pistol. That man was wired as tight as a kangaroo in heat. It obviously tortured him to have to wait for the others to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen too was becoming concerned. They should have been back by now. He struck the rock he had been examining with his flashlight. He should have gone with her. He knew more about caves than Michaelson. What if she disappeared like Halloway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda called from where she crouched by a cave pearl the size of a beachball. \"Ben, come see this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen crossed to her, squatted on his haunches beside her. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shine your light inside. The details are clearer here in this smaller stone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Linda, is this really the right time for this?\" he grumbled, but did as she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn escalating excitement hurried her words. \"Look at the orbital ridges. They bulge too thickly. And the auditory orifices. They\u0027re too low on the skull.\" She turned to Ben, her eyes shining. \"It\u0027s not human. Or I should say, not modern man. The size of the brain case does suggest an advanced hominid, but there\u0027s too much distortion for me to recognize the species. Ashley needs to see this. She\u0027d know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda suddenly looked around, voicing Ben\u0027s own concern. \"What\u0027s taking them so long to get back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden scream echoed through the cavern. Both Ben and Linda jumped up. Linda sidled closer to him. Ben\u0027s heart had climbed into his throat and was caught there. Ashley!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva already had his pistol raised and stood frozen, his flashlight beam acting as a gunsight. Khalid crossed to Linda, and like a small moon pulled into a different orbit, Linda drifted from Ben into Khalid\u0027s shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second scream. Ben stepped over to Villanueva. \"We need to go after them,\" Ben said. \"They\u0027re in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Villanueva. \"We stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy? They\u0027re being attacked!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SEAL\u0027s face was stone. \"No. The scream was far away. Beyond the river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you tell for sure? The acoustics in a cave are tricky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva continued to study the darkness ahead. \"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m heading out to check on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you try to leave, I\u0027ll shoot you in the leg.\" The casualness in which he said those words suggested he was not joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell do you think you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the senior ranking officer here. What I say goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the designated rendezvous location. If the others are in trouble, they will head here. We\u0027ll give them ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what? Go look for them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We head back up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And leave them down here? Like hell I will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michaelson has the radio. Without him, we have no means of communicating topside. If he\u0027s not back in ten minutes, we evacuate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stared into the black curtain, beyond which he imagined horrible acts being played out. Ashley running, hiding, pursued by slavering creatures. Ashley mauled and bleeding. He held his breath for most of the ten minutes. To hell with the damned SEAL. If she didn\u0027t return… he knew how to take care of himself in caves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva lowered his arm. The blackness quickly filled the void of his flashlight, greedily reclaiming its lost territory. \"Pack up,\" he said over his shoulder. \"We\u0027re heading out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen shifted from foot to foot, straining to pierce the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go, Mr. Brust.\" The SEAL pointed with his gun. \"Don\u0027t make this hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen had an idea. \"Wait. Everyone turn out your lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Linda, a tremor in her voice. \"Are you nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do it. If there\u0027s no sign of their lights, then we\u0027ll get the hell out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva studied him, squinting warily. \"One minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda snuggled closer to Khalid as they turned their lanterns off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp was swallowed up by darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a few seconds for Ben\u0027s eyes to adjust to the blindness, the vanquished camp lights still burning dull flares on his retinas. As these last traces faded, one area persisted, off to the left. His dilated pupils strained to focus. A glowing cave pearl. Then the glow shifted to another cave pearl. Closer. The lights were approaching. \"Someone\u0027s coming,\" Ben said, his voice booming with relief. \"They\u0027re on their way back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda said, \"Yes, I see it too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva called for lights. The darkness was beaten back by the flaring lanterns. Within minutes, bobbing flashlights could be seen approaching through the darkness. The SEAL still stood with his gun pointed forward. Once the lights were close enough, he yelled, \"Stop there! Identify yourselves!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley\u0027s voice came back angrily, \"Who the hell do you think it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Michaelson\u0027s voice: \"It\u0027s just us, Major. Relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva lowered his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley stomped into camp, followed by Michaelson, who kept glancing toward the river behind him. \"Whose bright idea was it to turn your lights off like that?\" Ashley asked sourly. \"We were using them as a beacon back here. We thought something happened and started racing back. Almost ran myself right over a cliff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda pointed a thumb at Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just looking for you,\" he said, nodding his head toward the SEAL. \"After we heard the scream, our mate here was planning on scrambling back topside with our tails between our legs if you didn\u0027t show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley bristled. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson interrupted, a hand raised in the air. \"He was correct. We had the radio. They didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen swallowed. \"But to leave you…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley rubbed her temples thoughtfully, then nodded. \"He\u0027s right. Next time, listen to him, Ben.\" She brushed past him, scanning the camp. \"Okay, under the circumstances, we need to make a decision whether to continue forward or go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson stepped forward. \"I suggest Villanueva and I cross the river to take a closer look while the rest of the camp stays put.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley shook her head. \"No. We stick together. We\u0027ve already seen what happens when we split up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we evacuate,\" Michaelson stated bluntly. \"I won\u0027t risk any more civilians. Halloway knew the risks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley scowled. \"And what if it was one of us out there screaming? Would you be so quick to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so,\" she said. \"I think Halloway deserves as much support as any of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda spoke up. \"Besides, he might just be injured or unconscious. He\u0027s been silent since the first screams. We can\u0027t leave without at least looking thoroughly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson began to object, but Ashley held up a hand. \"Since it\u0027s our civilian butts on the line, it should be our decision to continue forward or not.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-19.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
