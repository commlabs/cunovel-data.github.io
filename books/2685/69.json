All the chicks rotting away. The Gaileria just a memory. Everything gone.” Pause. “Evaporated.” Pause. “Is that a word?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” Dr. Nova says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, wow,” I say, staring out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will happen to you?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? You think that would stop me?” I ask back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think a f**king nuclear bomb is gonna end all this?” I’m saying. “No way, dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“End all what?” Dr. Nova asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll survive that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have been here forever and we will probably be around forever too.” I check my nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will we be doing?” Dr. Nova asks, barely paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roaming.” I shrug. “Flying around. Looming over you like a f**king raven. Picture the biggest raven you’ve ever seen. Picture it looming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are your parents, Jamie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I say and then, my voice rising toward a scream, “But I live the cool life and if you do not refill my prescription of Darvocet—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will you do, Jamie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI consider my options, then calmly explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be waiting,” I tell him. “I’ll be waiting in your bedroom one night. Or under the table of your favorite restaurant, mutilating your wittle foot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is … this a threat?” Dr. Nova asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or when you take your daughter to McDonald’s,” I say, “I’ll be dressed as Ronald McDonald or the Grimace and I’ll eat her in the parking lot while you watch and quickly get f**ked up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve talked about this before, Jamie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be waiting in the parking lot or in your daughter’s schoolyard or in a bathroom. I’ll be crouching in your bathroom. I’ll follow your daughter home from school and after I play f**ky with her I’ll be crouching in your bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Nova just looks at me, bored, as if my behavior is explainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was in the hospital room when your father died of cancer,” I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve mentioned this before,” he says idly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was rotting away, Dr. Nova,” I say. “I saw him. I saw your father rotting away. I told all my friends your father died of toxic shock. That he stuck a tampon up his ass and left it there too long. He died screaming, Dr. Nova.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you … killed anyone else recently, Jamie?” Dr. Nova asks, not too visibly shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a movie,” I say. “In my mind.” I giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Nova sighs, studies me, largely unassured. “What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to be in the backseat of your car, waiting, drooling—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear you, Jamie.” Dr. Nova sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want my Darvocet refilled or else I’m gonna be waiting beneath that lovely black-bottom pool of yours one night while you’re out for a little midnight swim, Dr. Nova, and I’ll pull veins and tendons out of your well-muscled thigh.” I’m standing now, pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll give you the Darvocet, Jamie,” Dr. Nova says. “But I want you here on a less irregular basis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m totally psyched,” I say. “You’re as cool as they come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fills out a prescription and then, while handing it to me, asks, “Why should I fear you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m a tan burly motherfucker and my teeth are so sharp they make a straight razor seem like a butter knife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. “Need a better reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you threaten me?” he asks. “Why should I fear you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m going to be that last image you ever see,” I tell him. “Count on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head toward the door, then turn back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s the place you feet safest?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In an empty movie theater,” Dr. Nova says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your favorite movie?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vacation, with Chevy Chase and Christie Brinkley.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-informers/page-69.html","bookId":2685,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:55 AM"}
