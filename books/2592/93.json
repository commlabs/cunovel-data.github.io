Did it play with the cat before eventually slashing it in half? Did the thing feed on the cat? Was the last thing the cat saw the contorted face of the bird and above it an empty gray sky? The writer pondered the various scenarios until I stepped in and forced the writer to hope this was not true. Because if I believed that the doll was responsible, the ground I stood on would shift into a world made of quicksand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that I recognized the cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had seen it the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen its mouth was stained red, and blood from a paw smeared a windowpane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mangled thing at my feet belonged to Aimee Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not tell this to the writer because the scenario he would have come up with—the obstacles he would solve and the world he would make me believe in—was more than I could bear on the morning of November fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo just as quickly as I recognized the cat as Aimee Light’s I immediately forced the thought from my mind before the writer could notice this detail and leap on it, expanding it with a horrible logic until everything surrounding us turned black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of whether the Terby had killed the cat, I was determined to get rid of it that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into the house to find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta had taken Robby and Sarah to school. Rosa was cleaning the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assumed that if the Terby was in the house it would be upstairs lying innocently in Sarah’s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Terby was not in Sarah’s bedroom. This was a discovery I made after a cursory inspection of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer told me it was hiding. The writer told me I needed to entice it from the hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked the writer how does something that’s not alive hide itself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked the writer how do you entice something that’s not alive out of its hiding place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis silenced the writer momentarily. The silence eventually worried me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer was reactivated when I moved to Sarah’s window and gazed down at the hedge and the mutilated cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer suggested we go to Robby’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated in the hallway outside Robby’s room and stared at the grooves carved in the bottom of the door, then turned the knob and entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was pristine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the neatest condition I had ever seen. Nothing was out of place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed was tightly made. There were no clothes strewn across the floor. The video-game cartridges and DVDs and magazines were stacked in even piles. The Martian landscape of the carpet had been recently vacuumed. There were no empty Starbucks cups lining the top of the minifridge. His desk was immaculate. The pillows on the leather sofa had no indentations on them. Every surface was clean. The room smelled of varnish and lemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a showroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it felt empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was supposed to feel peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there had been a concentrated effort to also make it feel benign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had ever lived in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something horribly wrong about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wrongness drew me toward the computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was pulsing on its screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain: hesitation.
