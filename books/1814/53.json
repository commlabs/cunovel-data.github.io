And have limo-sex, of course. You should never pass up the opportunity to have sex in a limo—it’s always fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s eyes are shiny with tears. happy ones. “I love it. James Brooks-Evans. It’s perfect. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward and kiss our son’s forehead. And then I kiss his mother’s lips. “You’ve got it all wrong, baby. I’m supposed to be thanking you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks down at James tenderly. And in that voice that could make an angel green with envy, she starts to sing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a song that they sing when they take to the highway\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA song that they sing when they take to the sea\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA song that they sing of their home in the sky\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut singing works just fine for me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo good night you moonlight ladies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock-a-bye sweet baby James\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep greens and blues are the colors I choose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWon¹t you let me go down in my dreams\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd rock-a-bye sweet baby James\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s only a few times in a guy’s life that he’s allowed to cry without looking like a total chump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of those times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kate is finished, I clear my throat. And rub the wetness from my eyes. Then I climb onto the bed beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m pretty sure it’s against hospital policy, and I admit, some of those male nurses look pretty f**king intimidating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut come on—they’re nurses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate turns toward me, so James lies between us. My arm lays over him, my hand on her hip, encircling them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s eyes are velvety warm. “Drew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think we’ll always be like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a small smile. “Definitely not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I touch her face—the one I plan on looking at every morning and every night, until death shows up to drag me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re just gonna keep getting better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there you have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow’s that for a happy frigging ending, huh? Or beginning . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess . . . depending on how you look at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, now’s about the time I start spouting off some pearls of wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut given the events of the last year, it’s become increasingly obvious that I don’t know what the f**k I’m talking about. I don’t think you should listen to anything I’ve said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou still want me to give it a shot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere goes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber One—people don’t change. There’s no magic bullet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo bibbidi-fucking-boo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat you see is what you get. Sure, certain habits can be tweaked. Reined in. Like my propensity for making snap judgments. The very idea of assuming I know everything—without checking with Kate first—now makes me sick to my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut other characteristics, they stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy possessiveness, Kate’s stubbornness, our collective competitiveness—they’re too much a part of who we are to be totally eradicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s kind of like . . . cellulite. You ladies can spend all day at the spa wrapped in mud and seaweed. You can throw a fortune away on those ridiculous creams and scrubs. But at the end of the day, that puckered, dimply skin is still gonna be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry to be the one to break it to you; it’s just the way it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you love someone, really love them, you take them as is. You don’t try to change them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want the whole package—cottage cheese ass and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber Two—life isn’t perfect. Or predictable. Don’t expect it to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne minute, you’re swimming along in the ocean. The water’s smooth and calm; you’re relaxed. And then—out of nowhere—an undertow sucks you down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s what you do next that counts. Do you give it all you’ve got? Kick for the surface, even though your arms and legs are aching? Or do you give up and let yourself drown?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow you react to life’s twists and turns makes all the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Number Three—the important thing is, if you can make it through the rough, unexpected times? That light at the end of the tunnel is worth all the shit you had to wade through to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s something I’ll never forget. I’m reminded of it every time I look at Kate. Every time I look at our son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it’s all said and done? The payoff is way more than f**king worth it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-53.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
