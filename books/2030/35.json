Smith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, would you like to dance then, Sheba Smith? If you feel well enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she breathed, half to herself. \"Yes, why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes never left his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot moving from where they were, Gabe and Sheba began swaying to the rhythm of yet another wretched song. This time, the horrid music didn\u0027t offend Gabe as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe put it together then. New girl. Amazing dress. Sheba. This was Logan\u0027s date, the one who\u0027d asked him to the prom and then wanted nothing more to do with him. For a half second, Gabe worried if it was wrong for him to infringe on his friend\u0027s date. But the worry passed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, Logan was happy with Libby. There was no sense in interrupting something that was clearly meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor another, Sheba and Logan were clearly not meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe had always had a good instinct for that-for the personalities that belonged together, for compatible natures that would pull together harmoniously. He\u0027d been the butt of many jokes about matchmaking, but he didn\u0027t mind. Gabe liked people to be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this intense girl with the deep pools in her eyes-Sheba-did not belong with Logan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat desperate sense of need had calmed when he\u0027d touched her. Gabe felt much better with her in his arms-holding her seemed to soothe the strange call. She was safe here, no longer drowning, no longer lost. Gabe was afraid to let her go, worried that the burning need would return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an odd first for Gabe, this feeling of being in exactly the right place, of being the only one that belonged here. It wasn\u0027t that he\u0027d never had a girlfriend before-girls liked Gabe, and he\u0027d had many casual relationships. But they never lasted. There was always someone else they belonged with. None of them really needed Gabe, except as a friend. And they\u0027d always stayed good friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had never been like this. Was this where Gabe belonged? Shielding this slender girl, holding her safe in his arms?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was silly to think so fatalistically. Gabe tried hard to act normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re new at Reed River, aren\u0027t you?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve only been here a few weeks,\" she confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we have any classes together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I would have remembered if I\u0027d been close to you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an odd way of phrasing it. She stared into his eyes, her hands clinging gently to his shoulders. Instinctively, he pulled her a little closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you having a good time tonight?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, a deep sigh from the center of her being. \"I am now,\" she said, oddly rueful. \"A very good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrapped! Like an idiot, like a new-spawned whelp, a novice, a rookie!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheba leaned into Gabe, unable to resist. Unable to want to resist. She stared into his heavenly eyes and had the most ridiculous urge to sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had she not seen the signs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way goodness itself surrounded him like a shield. The way her suggestions bounced right off him harmlessly. The way the only ones safe from her evil tonight-those little bubbles of happiness outside of her control-were the people he\u0027d touched and interacted with, his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes alone should have been warning enough!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeleste was smarter than Sheba. At least her instincts had kept her away from this dangerous boy. Once she was free of his piercing gaze, she\u0027d kept a safe distance between them. Why hadn\u0027t Sheba understood the reason behind this? And the reason Gabe had chosen Celeste in the first place. Of course he\u0027d been drawn to Celeste! It all made sense now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheba swayed to the beat that rumbled through the air, feeling the security of his body around her, protecting her. Tiny, unfamiliar tendrils of happiness twisted their way through her empty core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo-not that! Not happiness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was already feeling happy, then better things couldn\u0027t be too far behind. Was there no way to avoid the horrible wonder of love?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t very likely when you were in an angel\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a true angel. Gabe didn\u0027t have wings, he\u0027d never had them-he wasn\u0027t one of those sappy birdbrains who\u0027d traded feathers and eternity for human love. But one of his parents had done just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe was fully half-angel-though he didn\u0027t have a clue about his nature. If he\u0027d had any idea, Sheba would have heard that in his mind and escaped this divine horror. Now it was only too obvious to Sheba-this close, she could smell the scent of asphodel clinging to his skin. And, clearly, he\u0027d inherited his angel-parent\u0027s eyes. The heaven-blue eyes that should have been a dead giveaway, if Sheba hadn\u0027t been so wrapped up in her evil plotting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a reason even experienced demons like Jezebel were wary of angels. If it was hazardous for a human to stare into a demon\u0027s eyes, it was doubly so for a demon to get locked into an angel\u0027s. If ever a demon met an angel\u0027s gaze for too long, pfffffft!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;out went the fires of hell and the demon was trapped until the angel gave up on saving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that\u0027s what angels did. They saved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheba was an eternal being, and she was trapped for however long Gabe decided to keep her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full angel would have known what Sheba was at once, and driven her out if he were strong enough, or given her a wide berth if he wasn\u0027t. But Sheba could imagine what her presence would feel like to someone with Gabe\u0027s instinct to save. Innocent of the knowledge he needed to understand, Sheba\u0027s damned state must have been like a siren\u0027s call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared helplessly into Gabe\u0027s beautiful face, her body filling with happiness, and wondered how long the torture would last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready too long to save her perfect prom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout her hellfire, Sheba had no influence over the mortals here. But she was still fully aware, watching helpless and disgustingly blissful, as it all fell apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooper Silverdale gasped in horror as he looked at the gun glistening in his shaking hand. What was he thinking? He shoved the weapon back into its hiding place and half ran to the bathroom, where he violently vomited the punch into the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooper\u0027s stomach problems interrupted Matt and Derek\u0027s fistfight, which was just warming up in the men\u0027s room. The two friends squinted through their swollen eyes at each other. Why were they fighting? Over a girl that neither of them even liked? How stupid! Suddenly, they were interrupting each other in their urgent need to apologize. With smiles on split lips and arms around shoulders, they headed back to the ballroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Alvarado had given up his plans to jump Heath after the dance, because Evie had forgiven him for disappearing with Celeste. Her cheek was soft and warm against his now as they swayed to the slow music, and there was no way he would hurt her by disappearing again, not for any reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was not the only one who felt that way. As if the new song was magical rather than insipid, the dancers in the big ballroom each moved instinctively toward the person they should have come with in the first place, the one that would transform the night\u0027s misery into happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach Lauder, lonely and depressed, looked up from the unappetizing cookies straight into Vice Principal Finkle\u0027s sad eyes. She looked lonely, too. The coach walked toward her, smiling hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head and blinking her eyes like someone trying to escape a nightmare, Melissa Harris pulled away from Tyson and ran for the exit. She would find the concierge and get a cab...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a rubber band that had been stretched too far, the atmosphere at Reed River\u0027s prom now snapped back with a vengeance. If Sheba had been herself, she would have pulled that rubber band until it exploded into pieces. But now all the misery and wrath and hate vanished. The human minds had been stuck in their grip too long. With relief, everyone at the prom relaxed into happiness, grasped at love with two hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Celeste was tired of the mayhem. She stayed in Rob\u0027s arms, shuddering slightly at the memory of those perfect blue eyes, as one slow song melted into the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Sheba nor Gabe even noticed the song change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll her delicious pain and misery destroyed! Even if she did get free, Sheba was destined for middle school now. Where was the injustice?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jezebel! Had she planned this? Tried to distract Sheba from the fact that a dangerous half-angel was here tonight? Or would she be disappointed? Was she really there in encouragement? Sheba had no way to find out. She wouldn\u0027t even be able to see Jezebel now-whether the horned demoness was laughing or chagrined-with her fires extinguished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgusted with herself, Sheba sighed in happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe was just so good. And, in his arms, she felt good, too. She felt wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheba simply had to get free before happiness and love ruined her! Would she be trapped with some feather-back\u0027s heavenly offspring forever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe smiled at her, and she sighed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheba knew what Gabe would be feeling now. Angels were never happier than when they were making someone else happy, and the bigger the lift in that other person\u0027s spirit, the more ecstatic the angel. As perfectly miserable and damned as Sheba had been, Gabe must be flying now-it would be almost as good as having wings. He would never want to let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just one chance left for Sheba, just one way back to her wretched, miserable, burning, stinking home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe had to order her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of this chance, Sheba felt much worse, felt a welcome wave of her former misery. Gabe tightened his hold on her as he sensed her slipping down, and the misery was drowned in contentment, but Sheba remained hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up into his love-filled angel-eyes and smiled dreamily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re evil incarnate, Sheba told herself. You have a true talent for misery. You know suffering inside and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can get yourself out of this trap and everything will be like it used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, with as much pain and havoc as Sheba was capable of causing, how hard could it possibly be to get this angelic boy to tell her to go to hell? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-35.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
