Many experts in the Gu clan had gloomy expressions. Although the Gu clan was not destroyed by the Hun clan like the Ling clan, they had still lost the ancient jade. From a certain point of view, the Gu clan had suffered quite a big loss in the fight with the Hun clan…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light throughout the mountains slowly disappeared. Finally, it completely disappeared. It was fortunately that there was proper command. Otherwise, the entire mountain range would have been turned into dust in the battle. This would be considered a big loss to the Gu clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s fist was tightly clenched after he saw the light curtain disappeared. The Hun clan was indeed planning to use his father to exchange for the ancient jade…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Half a month later…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan pressed his lips tightly together. A chillness surged within his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan’s expression was gloomy as he watched the spot where the crack had disappeared in the sky. He did not speak. The three immortals of the Gu clan behind him also sighed quietly. The Hun clan had indeed been hiding their strength during these years. Who could have expected that the Nihility Devouring Flame had not only been fully recuperated but had even advance into the nine star Dou Sheng. If it was not because Lei Ying and Yan Jin had fought today, it was likely that this would be an extremely intense big battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the disappearance of the Hun clan, the rings on Lei Ying’s and Yan Jin’s finger suddenly lit up as they stood on the other side. A spiritual fluctuation containing some information was transmitted into their minds. Their expressions became dark and cold as they sensed this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Lei clan had lost its ancient jade…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Yan clan too…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of the Gu clan’s three immortals twitched involuntarily after hearing their words. Some shock surged within their eyes. Hun Tiandi was indeed telling the truth. They had also struck the Yan and Lei clans when they were attacking the Gu clan…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ancient jades of the two clan had been places in the most tightly guarded place. The Hun clan had launched such a large scale attack on the Gu clan. Where would they find such a strength to attack separately?” Gu Dao involuntarily opened his mouth and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Base on the information I received, the clan also had an Elder who had suddenly betrayed us. He stole the ancient jade and fled. Moreover, he was subsequently received by the experts from the Hun clan…” Lei Ying’s expression was frighteningly guard. He did not expect that such an incident had also occurred in the Lei clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have all underestimated the Hun clan…” Yan Jin slowly said. The strength that the Hun clan had displayed caused even him to feel a little grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will discuss this in the hall. Now that things had developed until this stage, there is already no room for us to retreat. Given the Hun clan’s techniques, it is obvious that they will not allow us to survive.” Gu Yuan’s expression gradually became calm. He waved his hand and allowed Gu Dao to settle the situation. After which, he turned his body and hurried towards the large hall. His voice was emitted when he entered the hall, “Xiao Yan, you should also come in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan suppressed the churning emotions within his heart as he looked at the others entering the hall one after another. He swiftly followed. Xun Er hesitated for a moment before following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone were a little quiet as they watched this scene. They vaguely sensed that the peaceful days of the past was gradually about to disappear…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone took their seats within the hall. However, the atmosphere continued to remain solemn because of the earlier incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone, there is no need to utter any nice words at this moment. Everyone should be clearly aware of the Hun clan’s techniques. I have never underestimated the Hun clan before but I have also never been able to clearly understand them. This is the most terrifying aspect of the Hun clan.” Gu Yuan sighed as he looked at the somewhat grave hall. He shook his head and said, “Hun Tiandi might be right. If I had been a little firmer when the Xiao clan and the Hun clan were engaging in a big war, the situation would likely be very different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was quiet. He did not really understand the matter back then. Hence, he was unable to say anything. The eight ancient clans had not been harmonious since the beginning. There had been many conflicts between them. Hence, no one had the right to blame any party for not lending a hand in a conflict. Moreover, they had also began to taste the result of the Xiao clan being eliminated…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is likely that even the Gu clan could not match the strength that the Hun clan had displayed. Currently, there is likely no single faction on the Dou Qi continent that could fight the Hun clan by itself. Even the Gu clan is unable to. Of course, even if my Gu clan ends up being completely destroyed, the Hun clan will definitely have to pay a severe price for doing so!” Gu Yuan’s expression was grave as he spoke. The big battle today could be considered an initial exchange between the two clans. Although the Hun clan’s army did not appear, it had still unleashed an attack across the spatial crack. However, the most troublesome people to deal with were Hun Tiandi and the Nihility Devouring Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe latter had been seriously injured by him back then. No one could have imagined that he had not only fully recovered but had even stepped into the nine star Dou Sheng class. In this way, he had completely broken the weak equilibrium of both parties. Both he and Hun Tiandi were at the advance nine star Dou Sheng class. There was not much of a gap between them. Unless they engaged in a true life and death struggle, no one would be able to do anything to the other. If a Nihility Devouring Flame was added, he would not be able to fight with the two of them combined with his strength. Hence, forming an alliance was the only method to deal with the Hun clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Nihility Devouring Flame had once devoured a Touling King, Hence, he possess the ability of the Touling clan. In the eyes of the Hun clan, us, the ancient clans, are equivalent to their bloodline spring… everyone might not be happy with this status. Since that is the case, there is only one path for us to take. It is to destroy the Hun clan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dense murderous desire suddenly surged within the hall after the words sounded. It caused one’s skin to turn a little cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder Gu Yuan, you mean… an alliance to fight with the Hun clan together?” Lei Ying asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no other choice but this. The strength that the Hun clan has displayed today is extremely great. Moreover, no one knows if there is any other trump cards within the Hun clan. One really have a difficult time grasping this mysterious clan…” Gu Yuan slowly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLei Ying and Yan Jin were quiet. If this was really the case, it would be an absolute disaster for both their clans. They would definitely not allow their clan to be a bloodline spring in the eyes of the Hun clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The matter of an alliance is possible. Currently, the Hun clan already possess seven of the eight jade pieces. If they were to obtain the last piece, they would be able to know where the Tou She Ancient God Jade is located and open it. It is rumoured that the cave has the secret to advance into the Dou Di class. If Hun Tiandi is allowed to obtain it, perhaps… it will really be as he had said. He will advance into the Dou Di class, which no one had reached in ten thousand years…” Yan Jin licked his mouth and said. “At that time, the entire continent will completely fall under the control of the Hun clan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was quiet. If Hun Tiandi really advanced into that level, it was likely that all of them would lose any ability to retaliate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the legendary Dou Di, even the ancient clans were not worth mentioning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, it was likely that he would be able to easily eliminate all the ancient clans with the flip of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The final piece of jade should be on Xiao Yan, right?” Everyone’s eyes suddenly turned towards Xiao Yan. They had all heard the words Hun Tiandi had left behind before he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan frowned slightly in the face of the many pairs of eyes. He spoke in a deep voice, “I must rescue my father!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s voice was soft but there was an unshakable firmness within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be aware of the result if Hun Tiandi is allowed to open the Tou She Ancient God Mansion.” Yan Jin’s bright red eyebrow trembled and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was quiet. However, he continued shaking his head. The final piece of ancient jade will definitely remain on his body. His father had already been captured by the Hun clan for over a decade. Each time he thought of this, his heart began to feel a little twisted. Moreover, he also understood that the ancient jade was the protective charm of his father. If it was not because the ancient jade was in his hand, it was likely that his father would have already met his demise...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan’s eyes stared at Xiao Yan. A moment later, he could only smile bitterly and sigh. Currently, XiaoYan was no longer alone like he was back then. His current strength was not only able to fight them head on but there was also an extremely powerful Sky Mansion Alliance behind him. If the three ancient clans wished to fight the Hun clan, the Sky Mansion Alliance would definitely be of a great help. Hence, attempting to snatch the ancient jade was something that they could not do no matter how they looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, the only thing we can do is to quickly gather helpers. The army will gather in half a month. We must definitely snatch some ancient jade from the hands of the Hun clan!” Gu Yuan sighed and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLei Ying and Yan Jin shook upon hearing this. In this way…they would truly engage in a war with the Hun clan in half a month’s time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan clenched his fist. An icy cold hand was extended from beside him and grabbed his arm. He turned his head and glanced at Xun Er beside him. Suddenly he looked at Gu Yuan and said, “Uncle Gu, do you know if there is any method that can allow the ancestor of the Xiao clan, Xiao Xuan, in the Heavenly Tomb to be revived?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan, Lei Ying and the others in the hall felt their hands trembled upon hearing the words ‘Xiao Xuan’. That name continued to be deeply ingrained in their minds even after thousands of years. That was the only person who had nearly managed to kill Hun Tiandi in the many years that had passed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a certain point of view, Xiao Xuan in the Heavenly Tomb is merely a soul fragment. He is only able to exist and possess his strength due to the unique aspect of the Heavenly Tomb. Trying to revive him… I’m afraid that it will be impossible.” Gu Yuan sighed and said. If it was possible to revive Xiao Xuan, they would not find it so troublesome to deal with Hun Tiandi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s eyes immediately revealed a disappointment upon hearing this. He was quiet for a moment before he spoke again, “I wish to enter the Heavenly Tomb again. May I know if uncle Gu has any way to do so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan was startled. He hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you insist on doing so, I will be able to send you in. Perhaps, you can find Xiao Xuan and see if he has any way to revive himself…”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1593\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1595\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1594","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM"}
