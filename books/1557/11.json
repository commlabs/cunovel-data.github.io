It had taken Matt the better part of fifteen minutes to secure the car booster seats into place. Who the hell had designed these things- NASA?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up, partner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what McDonald\u0027s has right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you. We\u0027re not going to McDonald\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know. I\u0027m just saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what McDonald\u0027s has right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the new Shrek movie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got Shrek toys,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means McDonald\u0027s does,\" Ethan chipped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a fact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027re free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not free,\" Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are so. It\u0027s in the Happy Meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which are overpriced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overwhat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going to McDonald\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were just saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got free toys, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the new Shrek movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember when we saw the first Shrek movie, Uncle Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like Donkey,\" Ethan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" Matt agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Donkey is the toy this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going to McDonald\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Cause Chinese is good too,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even though they don\u0027t got toys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I like spare ribs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And dim sum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom likes the string beans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh. You don\u0027t like string beans, do you, Uncle Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re good for you,\" Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan turned to his brother. \"That means no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt smiled, tried to push away the day. Paul and Ethan were good for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrived at Cathay, an old-fashioned Chinese restaurant with the retro classics like chow mein and egg foo young, cracked vinyl booths, and a grumpy old woman at the front counter who watched you eat as if fearing you\u0027d pocket the utensils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food was greasy, but that was as it should be. The boys ate a ton. At McDonald\u0027s, they picked. They managed maybe half a burger and a dozen fries. Here they cleaned the plate. Chinese restaurants would be well served by handing out movie tie-in toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan, as always, was animated. Paul was a bit more reserved. They had been raised in pretty much the exact manner, the same gene pool, and yet they couldn\u0027t be more different. Ethan was the cutup. He never sat still. He was messy and lively and shunned affection. When Paul colored, he always stayed in the lines. He got frustrated when he made a mistake. He was thoughtful, a good athlete, and liked to cuddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNature waaay over nurture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped at Dairy Queen on the ride home. Ethan ended up wearing more soft vanilla than he consumed. When he pulled into the driveway Matt was surprised to see that Marsha wasn\u0027t back yet. He took them inside- he had a key- and gave them a bath. It was eight o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt put on an episode of The Fairly OddParents, which was pretty funny on an adult level, and then convinced the boys using negotiating skills picked up in legal pleadings across the state to get into bed. Ethan was afraid of the dark, so Matt turned on the SpongeBob night-light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt checked his watch. Eight thirty. He didn\u0027t mind staying later, but he was getting a little worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed into the kitchen. The latest works of art by Paul and Ethan hung on the refrigerator by magnets. There were photographs, too, in acrylic frames that never seemed to hold the photos in place. Most were halfway slipping out. Matt carefully slid the images back where they belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the top of the fridge, too high for the children to reach (if not see?) there were two photographs of Bernie. Matt stopped and stared at his brother. After a while he turned away and picked up the kitchen phone. He dialed Marsha\u0027s cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarsha had caller ID and answered, \"Matt? I was just about to call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you at the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are. And the boys are bathed and in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, you\u0027re good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt asked, \"Do you need me to stay awhile?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. Olivia\u0027s still in Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said, and there was something in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched ears. \"Uh, what time do you think you\u0027ll be getting-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied to you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t have a school meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m out on a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure what to say to that, Matt went with the reliable \"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have told you before.\" She lowered her voice. \"It\u0027s not a first date either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes found his brother\u0027s in the photograph on the refrigerator. \"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been seeing someone. It\u0027s been almost two months now. The boys don\u0027t know anything about it, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to explain to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Matt. Yeah, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind spending the night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. \"No,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t mind at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be home before the boys wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a sniffle then. She was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, Marsha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up the phone. It was a good thing, Marsha going out. It was a very good thing. But his eyes drifted back toward his brother. Unfair and wrong as it was, Matt couldn\u0027t help but think that his brother had never seemed more gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-11.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
