It\u0027s never going to end, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was silent. What could he answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor, of course, it would not end. Not for this planet. It would end for this brave young soul seated beside him. But not well. This is one of the great tragedies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the man had come to love this Felix. He loved \"dealing\" with him. The Supreme Pontiff was unaccustomed to having to \"deal\" with anyone, save heads of state. He had enjoyed it immensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix had gotten everything he wanted. One dozen priests, recruited from all over the world, all strong, all brave, all devoted. He had gotten the bishop he had demanded, an American-born bishop, who even now waited for them in Brazil, where the Team would first train for a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a happy peal of laughter and both turned to the source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of the sisters had come to see the young bride\u0027s ring. It was hardly in keeping with the poverty vows, of course, but the Man believed every single sister in Rome had managed to come and view it at least once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow lovely she is, thought the Man, seeing her proud display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another peal of laughter, and then a wicked squeal, as the other young American, the one called Cat, made a comment the two men seated could not hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt something off-color once again, thought the Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even in this he was glad, for this one had been such a thin and shallow scarecrow of a soul when first he had arrived, uncertain, unbelieving - suspicious of all save his leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now look at him! How he smiles and jokes and how devoted are he and Davette! Hard to believe they were not brother and sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man glanced again at Felix, who was still watching the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right not to tell his friend about Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right about much. Though foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the ring,\" said Felix suddenly, almost shyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man nodded. It was an ancient stone, three hundred years in the Vatican treasury being dusted. Now it shone on a bride\u0027s finger, as it should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And thanks,\" added Felix, with more than a little embarrassment, \"for marrying us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man smiled. \"It was our pleasure,\" he said sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it truly had been. His aides had not understood his enjoyment, for Felix had, at the last second, refused to be converted to the Church. To everyone\u0027s amazement, the Man had waived the requirement and had performed the ceremony personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had, he must admit, found it terribly amusing, this young American\u0027s stubborn \"point of honor.\" And he would smile whenever he thought of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was that American phrase? Like being \"a little bit pregnant\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the young warrior was converted. He simply refused to admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn aide appeared at the edge of a terrace door, eyeing him expectantly. The Man knew what he wanted, to remind him of his scheduled duties for that day. But the Man did not wish to go until the others did. This was their last day, their last hours, in his personal care. And...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd do I fear I will never see them again? Or do I fear my own sense of guilt when they go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. He could not help them more. He could not shout from the rooftops their plight. He could not tell the world what he - and they, and the victims - knew to be so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither could he explain it to the young warrior. He had tried, telling him of the long, hard journey of the Mother Church, of the awful tragedy if they should return, or even be perceived to be returning, to those dark, Dark Ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor there were not many vampires. There were not. And soon, with the power of world knowledge, there would be none. And that would, as the young warrior had insisted, be a great goodness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what then? When every priest felt emboldened and empowered to see evil everywhere? To think nothing of the witch hunts of other authorities, once the boundaries of law had been \"temporarily\" lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man prayed and grieved every night for the victims of the Beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not wish to pray and grieve for the excesses of man unwittingly doing the Beast\u0027s business for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had tried to convey some of this. But the young warrior\u0027s ears been deaf. \"Scapegoat\" and \"guinea pig\" had been his bitter terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am right, too, am I not, Lord?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, then, help me bear the loss of this brave one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you leave, my son?\" the Man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shrugged and stood up. \"As soon as your man comes. What is his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in answer, Father Francisco suddenly appeared, rushing out onto the terrace, bowing to kiss the Man\u0027s ring, then breathlessly explaining his tardiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man assured him all was well. Felix did the same, shaking his hand. The young priest seemed relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also seemed a titan on earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was over six-foot-five and weighed almost three hundred pounds, with enormous shoulders and thighs and a great bulging muscular neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded pleasantly to him, then called the others together to go. Then he whispered to Francisco to go on ahead and turned back to the Man. His voice was almost a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father, Jack loved you, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man hesitated, said, \"Yes, he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He also hated you, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. The young man looked pained, looked reluctant, miserable. At last he sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I\u0027ll start to hate you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Man did not answer. What could he answer? Of course the young warrior would soon hate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, he would be correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not go! he wanted to say. But he could not say this. Stay and enjoy my gardens and the sunshine and your lives!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not say this either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather, forgive me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd had gathered at the door to the terrace. More goodbyes were said. There were final smiles. A final embrace for the bride. Then it was time to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat, who had not yet met the towering Francisco, was impressed. He stared openly at the massive build, the great tree-trunk legs, and particularly at the bulging neck as wide as his own waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What,\" he asked suddenly, \"is the Church\u0027s position on steroids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" he added quickly to the cleric\u0027s surprised face. \"Come with me Francisco,\" he said next, guiding the larger man through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stopped, looked up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, Father, can you drive a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" replied Cat and he started them through the door again and down the hall out of sight. \"You can drive. Then, if it breaks down, you can carry it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were all gone. Only the Man stood alone in his garden, smiling. Proud. Sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Sweet Savior, how you must love them... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-33.html","bookId":2118,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM"}
