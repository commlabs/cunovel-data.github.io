Babe Rawlins had the use of her em- ployer\u0027s car for the weekend. We brought suits and hung them on the car windows and took off for Central City, Ray Rawlins driving, Tim Gray lounging in the back, and Babe up front. It was my first view of the interior of the Rockies. Central City is an old mining town that was once called the Richest\u0026nbsp; Square Mile in the World, where a veritable shelf of silver had been found\u0026nbsp; by the old buzzards who roamed the hills. They grew wealthy overnight\u0026nbsp; and had a beautiful little opera house built in the midst of their shacks on the steep slope. Lillian Rus- sell had come there, and opera stars from\u0026nbsp; Europe. Then Central City became a ghost town, till the energetic Chamber of Commerce types of the new West decided to revive the place. They polished up the opera house, and every summer stars from the Metropolitan came\u0026nbsp; out\u0026nbsp; and performed. It was a big vacation for everybody. Tourists came\u0026nbsp; from everywhere, even Hollywood stars. We drove up the mountain and found the narrow streets chock full of chichi tourists. I thought of Ma- jor\u0027s Sam, and Major was right. Major himself was there, turning on his big social smile to everybody and ooh-ing and aah-ing most sincerely over everything. \"Sal,\" he cried, clutching my arm, \"just look at this old town. Think how it\u0026nbsp; was\u0026nbsp; a hundred--what the hell, only eighty, sixty years ago; they had opera!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\"Yeah,\" I said, imitating one of his characters, \"but ithey\u0027rei\n\u003cbr\u003e\"The bastards,\" he cursed. But he went off to enjoy himself, Betty Gray on his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003eBabe Rawlins was an enterprising blonde. She knew of an old miner\u0027s house at the edge of town where we boys could sleep for the weekend; all we had to do was clean it out. We could also throw vast parties\u0026nbsp; there. It was an old shack of a thing covered with an inch of dust inside; it had a porch and a well in back. Tim Gray and Ray Raw- lins rolled up their sleeves and started in cleaning it, a major job that took them all afternoon and part of the night. But they had a bucket of beer bottles and everything was fine.\n\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, I was scheduled to be a guest at the opera that after- noon,\u0026nbsp; escorting Babe on my arm. I wore a suit of Tim\u0027s. Only a few days ago I\u0027d\u0026nbsp; come into Denver like a bum; now I was all racked up sharp\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; suit,\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; beautiful\u0026nbsp; well-dressed\u0026nbsp; blonde\u0026nbsp; on\u0026nbsp; my\u0026nbsp; arm, bowing to dignitaries\u0026nbsp; and chatting in the lobby under andeliers. I wondered what Mississippi Gene would say if he could see me.\n\u003cbr\u003eThe opera was iFidelioi. \"What gloom!\" cried the baritone, rising out of the dungeon under a groaning stone. I cried for it. That\u0027s how I see life too. I was so interested in the opera that for a while I for- got the circumstances of my crazy life and got lost in the great mourn- ful sounds of Beethoven and the rich Rembrandt tones of his story.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, Sal, how did you like the production for this year?\" asked Denver D. Doll proudly in the street outside. He was connected with the opera association.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"What gloom, what gloom,\" I said. \"It\u0027s absolutely great.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"The next thing you\u0027ll have to do is meet the members of the cast,\" he went on in his official tones, but luckily he forgot this in the rush of other things, and vanished.\n\u003cbr\u003eBabe and I went back to the miner\u0027s shack. I took off my duds and\u0026nbsp; joined the boys in the cleaning. It was an enormous job. Roland Major\u0026nbsp; sat\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; middle\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; front\u0026nbsp; room\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; had\u0026nbsp; already\u0026nbsp; been cleaned and refused to help. On a little table in front of him he had his bottle of beer and his glass. As we rushed around with buckets of wa- ter and\u0026nbsp; brooms he reminisced. \"Ah, if you could just come with me sometime and drink Cinzano and hear the musicians of Bandol, then you\u0027d be living. Then there\u0027s Normandy in the summers, the sabots, the fine old Calvados. Come on,\u0026nbsp; Sam,\" he said to his invisible pal. \"Take the wine out of the water and let\u0027s see if it got cold enough while we fished.\" Straight out of Hemingway, it was.\n\u003cbr\u003eWe called out to girls who went by in the street. \"Come on help us clean up the joint. Everybody\u0027s invited to our party tonight.\" They joined us. We had a huge crew working for us. Finally the singers in the opera\u0026nbsp; chorus, mostly young kids, came over and pitched in. The sun went down.\n\u003cbr\u003eOur day\u0027s work over, Tim, Rawlins, and I decided to sharp up for the big night. We went across town to the rooming house where the opera stars were living. Across the night we heard the beginning of the evening performance. \"Just right,\" said Rawlins. \"Latch on to some of these razors and towels and we\u0027ll spruce up a bit.\" We also took hair- brushes, colognes, shaving lotions, and went laden into the bathroom. We all took baths and sang. \"Isn\u0027t this great?\" Tim Gray kept saying. \"Using the opera stars\u0027\u0026nbsp; bathroom and towels and shaving lotion and electric azors.\"\n\u003cbr\u003eIt was a wonderful night. Central City is two miles high; at first you get drunk on the altitude, then you get tired, and there\u0027s a fever in your soul. We approached the lights around the opera house down the narrow\u0026nbsp; dark street; then we took a sharp right and hit some old sa- loons with swinging doors. Most of the tourists were in the opera. We started\u0026nbsp; off\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; few\u0026nbsp; extra-size\u0026nbsp; beers.\u0026nbsp; There\u0026nbsp; was\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; player\u0026nbsp; piano. Beyond the back door was a view of mountainsides in the moonlight. I let out a yahoo. The night was on.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003eWe hurried back to our miner\u0027s shack. Everything was in prepa- ration for the big party. The girls, Babe and Betty, cooked up a snack of beans and franks, and then we danced and started on the beer for fair. The opera over, great crowds of young girls came piling into our place. Rawlins and Tim and I licked our lips. We grabbed them and danced. There was no music, just dancing. The place filled up. People began to bring bottles. We rushed out to hit the bars and rushed back.\n\u003cbr\u003eThe night was getting more and more frantic. I wished Dean and Carlo were there--then I realized they\u0027d be out of place and un- happy. They were like the man with the dungeon stone and the gloom, rising from\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; underground, the sordid hipsters of America, a new beat generation that I was slowly joining.\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\u0026nbsp; boys\u0026nbsp; from\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; chorus\u0026nbsp; showed\u0026nbsp; up.\u0026nbsp; They\u0026nbsp; began\u0026nbsp; singing \"Sweet Adeline.\" They also sang phrases such as \"Pass me the beer\" and \"What are you doing with your face hanging out?\" and great long baritone\u0026nbsp; howls of \"Fi-de-lio!\" \"Ah me, what gloom!\" I sang. The girls were terrific. They went out in the backyard and necked with us. There were beds in the other rooms, the uncleaned dusty ones, and I had a girl sitting on one and was talking with her when suddenly there was a great inrush of young\u0026nbsp; ushers\u0026nbsp; from the opera, who just grabbed girls and kissed them without\u0026nbsp; proper come-ons. Teenagers, drunk, dishe- veled, excited--they ruined our party. Inside of five minutes every sin- gle girl was gone and a great big fraternity-type party got under way with banging of beer bottles and roars.\n\u003cbr\u003eRay and Tim and I decided to hit the bars. Major was gone, Babe and Betty were gone. We tottered into the night. The opera crowd was\u0026nbsp; jamming the bars from bar to wall. Major was shouting above heads. The eager, bespectacled Denver D. Doll was shaking hands with everybody\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; saying,\u0026nbsp; \"Good afternoon,\u0026nbsp; how are you?\" and\u0026nbsp; when midnight came he was saying, \"Good afternoon, how are iyoui?\" At one point I saw him going\u0026nbsp; off somewhere with a dignitary. Then he came back with a middle-aged woman; next minute he was talking to a couple of young ushers in the street. The next minute he was shaking my\u0026nbsp; hand\u0026nbsp; without\u0026nbsp; recognizing\u0026nbsp; me\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; saying,\u0026nbsp; \"Happy\u0026nbsp; New\u0026nbsp; Year, m\u0027boy.\"\u0026nbsp; He\u0026nbsp; wasn\u0027t drunk\u0026nbsp; on\u0026nbsp; liquor,\u0026nbsp; just\u0026nbsp; drunk on\u0026nbsp; what\u0026nbsp; he\u0026nbsp; liked-- crowds of people milling. Everybody knew him. \"Happy New Year,\" he called, and sometimes \"Merry Christmas.\" He said this all the time. At Christmas he said Happy Halloween.\n\u003cbr\u003eThere was a tenor in the bar who was highly respected by eve- ryone;\u0026nbsp; Denver Doll had insisted that I meet him and I was trying to avoid it; his name was D\u0027Annunzio or some such thing. His wife was with him. They sat sourly at a table. There was also some kind of Ar- gentinian tourist at the bar. Rawlins gave him a shove to make room; he turned and snarled. Rawlins handed me his glass and knocked him down on the brass rail with one punch. The man was momentarily out. There were screams; Tim and I\u0026nbsp; scooted Rawlins out. There was so much confusion the sheriff couldn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; even thread his way through the crowd to find the victim. Nobody could identify Rawlins. We went to other bars. Major staggered up a dark street. \"What the hell\u0027s the mat- ter? Any fights? Just call on me.\" Great laughter rang from all sides. I wondered what the Spirit of the Mountain was\u0026nbsp; thinking, and looked up and saw jackpines in the moon, and saw ghosts of old miners, and wondered about it. In the whole eastern dark wall of the\u0026nbsp; Divide this night there was silence and the whisper of the wind, except in the ra- vine where we roared; and on the other side of the Divide was the great\u0026nbsp; Western\u0026nbsp; Slope,\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; big\u0026nbsp; plateau\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; went\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; Steamboat Springs, and dropped, and led you to the western Colorado desert and the Utah desert; all in darkness now as we fumed and screamed in our mountain nook, mad drunken Americans in the mighty land. We were on the roof of America and all we could do was yell, I guess--across the night, eastward over\u0026nbsp; the Plains, where somewhere an old man with white hair was probably walking toward us with the Word, and would arrive any minute and make us silent.\n\u003cbr\u003eRawlins insisted on going back to the bar where he\u0027d fought. Tim and I didn\u0027t like it but stuck to him. He went up to D\u0027Annunzio, the tenor, and threw a highball in his face. We dragged him out. A ba- ritone singer from the chorus joined us and we went to a regular Cen- tral City bar. Here Ray called the waitress a whore. A group of sullen men were ranged along the bar; they hated tourists. One of them said, \"You boys better be out of here by the count of ten.\" We were. We stag- gered back to the shack and went to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the morning I woke up and turned over; a big cloud of dust rose\u0026nbsp; from the mattress. I yanked at the window; it was nailed. Tim Gray was in the bed too. We coughed and sneezed. Our breakfast con- sisted of stale beer.\u0026nbsp; Babe came back from her hotel and we got our things together to leave.\n\u003cbr\u003eEverything seemed to be collapsing. As we were going out to the car Babe\u0026nbsp; slipped\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; fell\u0026nbsp; flat\u0026nbsp; on\u0026nbsp; her\u0026nbsp; face.\u0026nbsp; Poor\u0026nbsp; girl was\u0026nbsp; over- wrought. Her brother and Tim and I helped her up. We got in the car; Major and Betty joined us. The sad ride back to Denver began.\n\u003cbr\u003eSuddenly we came down from the mountain and overlooked the great sea-plain of Denver; heat rose as from an oven. We began to sing songs. I was itching to get on to San Francisco.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/164.html","bookId":295,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM"}
