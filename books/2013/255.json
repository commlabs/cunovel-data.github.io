Well, that was a relief, since Orbyn was in the habit of sweating pro-fusely in Letur’s cramped contrivance. He watched as the washed-out man picked a delicate path up to where stood Orbyn. Overdressed for the mild air, his lank, white hair covered by a broad-rimmed hat to keep the sun from pallid skin, his strangely round face already flushed with exertion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruthfinder,’ he said as soon as he reached the bulge of bedrock, ‘we both know what our scouts will tell us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, Factor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So… where are they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn’s thin brows rose, and he blinked to clear the sudden sweat stinging his eyes. ‘As you know, they never descended farther than this-where we are camped right now. Leaving three possibilities. One, they turned round, back up and through the pass-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They were not seen to do that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. Two, they left the trail here and went south, perhaps seeking the Pearls Pass into south Bluerose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Travelling the spine of the mountains? That seems unlikely, Truthfinder.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Three, they went north from here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Factor licked his lips, as if considering something. Inflectionless, he asked, ‘Why would they do that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn shrugged. ‘One could, if one so desired, skirt the range until one reached the coast, then hire a craft to take one to virtually any coastal village or port of the Bluerose Sea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Months.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fear Sengar and his companions are well used to that, Factor. No fugitive party has ever fled for as long within the confines of the empire as have they.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not through skill alone, Truthfinder. We both know that the Edur could have taken them a hundred times, in a hundred different places… And further, we both know why they have not done so. The question you and I have danced round for a long, long time is what, if anything, are we going to do regarding all of that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That question, alas,’ said Orbyn, ‘is one that can only be addressed by our masters, back in Letheras.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Masters?’ Letur Anict snorted. ‘They have other, more pressing concerns. We must act independently, in keeping with the responsibilities granted us; indeed, in keeping with the very expectation that we will meet those responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo we stand aside while Fear Sengar searches for the Edur god? Do we stand aside while Hannan Mosag and his so-called hunters work their deft incompetence in this so-called pursuit? Is there any doubt in your mind, Orbyn Truthfinder, that Hannan Mosag is committing treason? Against the Emperor? Against the empire?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karos Invictad, and, I’m sure, the Chancellor, are dealing with the matter of the Warlock King’s treason.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No doubt. Yet what might occur to their plans if Fear Sengar should succeed? What will happen to all of our plans, should the Edur God of Shadows rise again?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That, Factor, is highly unlikely.’ No, it is in fact impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am well acquainted,’ Letur Anict said testily, ‘with probabilities and risk assessment, Truthfinder.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is it you desire?’ Orbyn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetur Anict’s smile was tight. He faced north. ‘They are hiding. And we both know where.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn was not happy. ‘The extent of your knowledge surprises me, Factor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have underestimated me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It seems I have at that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruthfinder. I have with me twenty of my finest guard. You have forty soldiers and two mages. We have enough lanterns to cast out darkness and so steal the power of those decrepit warlocks. How many remain in that hidden fastness? If we strike quickly, we can rid ourselves of this damnable cult and that alone is worth the effort. Capturing Fear Sengar in the bargain would sweeten the repast. Consider the delight, the accolades, should we deliver to Karos and the Chancellor the terrible traitor, Fear Sengar, and that fool, Udinaas. Consider, if you will, the rewards.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn Truthfinder sighed, then he said, ‘Very well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you know the secret path. I suspected as much.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you do not, and 1 knew as much. He withdrew a handkerchief and mopped the sweat from his face, then along the wattle beneath his chin. ‘The climb is strenuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shall have to leave the carriages and horses here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your three scouts can serve to guard the camp. They have earned a rest. When do we leave, Truthfinder?’ Orbyn grimaced. ‘Immediately.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the three scouts were sitting beside a fire on which sat a soot-stained pot of simmering tea, while the third one rose, arched to ease his back, then sauntered towards the modest train that had spent most of the day descending into the valley. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-255.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
