{"id":21316,"no":65,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"Though there had been no open rupture, from that day forward Odiam was divided into two camps. On one side were Reuben and Pete, on the other, Tilly and Richard. Benjamin and Caro were neutrals; they were indifferent to vital issues, one engrossed in snatching holidays, the other in hankering after she did not quite know what. Pete had always been a good son, hard-working and enthusiastic, not exactly a comrade, but none the less an ally, always to be depended on and now and then taken into confidence. He seemed to accept his father\u0027s attitude towards George\u0027s death and to resent Richard\u0027s and Tilly\u0027s. That spring he beat Squinty Bream at Robertsbridge Fair, and gave half the purse to Reuben to buy a chaff-cutter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of the enemy Tilly was the most effective—Reuben did not quite know how to deal with her. His inability to despise her told heavily against him. Richard, on the other hand, he despised from the depths of his heart. The boy was insufferable, for he still had his old knack of saving his skin. It was nearly always impossible to pick any definite faults in his work—it was wonderful how he managed to combine unwillingness with efficiency. He also had an irritating habit of speaking correct English, and of alluding to facts and events of which Reuben had never heard in such a manner as to make it impossible for him not to show his ignorance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben never lost a chance of baiting him, he jibed at his squeamishness and fine manners, at his polite way of eating and the trouble he took to clean his nails; he despised him all the more for occasionally getting the better of him, verbally at any rate, in these encounters. One night at supper Reuben, having actually succeeded in finding this sneering son at fault, abused him roundly for the shocking condition of the ewes\u0027 fleeces. Richard[Pg 228] had the bad sense to quote Shakespeare, whereat Reuben told him that if he could not speak English he could leave the room. Richard replied that he would be very pleased to do so, as certain people\u0027s table-manners made supper rather an ordeal. Reuben helped him out with a kick most vulgarly placed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day Backfield was due at an auction at Northiam, but before leaving he ordered Richard to clean out the pig-sties. It was not, properly speaking, his work at all, but Reuben hoped it would make him sick, or that he would refuse to obey and thus warrant his father knocking him down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly,\" said Richard without a tremor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, thank you,\" said Reuben, bowing in mock politeness, and trying to copy his clipped English.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ten minutes later he rode off, and the family separated to their tasks, or to such evasions of them as were possible in the master\u0027s absence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tilly cleared the table and began to prepare the dinner. She had promised the boys a bag pudding, and must start it early. She had not been cooking more than half an hour when the door opened, and Richard came in, dressed in a neat black suit with a stiff Gladstone collar. His hair was nicely brushed, and he carried a pair of gloves and a little valise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\" cried Tilly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m off,\" said Richard shortly, banging down his valise on the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Off!—where?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To London.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tilly gaped at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sick of all this, I\u0027m sick of the old man and his beastliness. Miss Bardon is lending me money to go to London University, and perhaps I shall read for the Bar.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Bar,\" repeated Tilly vaguely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I\u0027ve learned a heap of Latin and other things[Pg 229] during the last five years, and two or three years at the University ought to be all I want. Miss Bardon\u0027s taught me—I owe everything to her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must say as how you\u0027ve kept it dark.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She knew of his friendship with Anne Bardon, but had never expected it to bear such generous fruit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, it would never have done if the old man had got to know of it. Good heavens, Tilly! How can you live on with that old brute?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe I shan\u0027t much longer,\" said Tilly, looking down at her rolling-pin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richard stared at her for a moment—\"I\u0027m glad to hear it. But the others—oh, my dear girl, this is damnable!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tilly sighed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The law ought to suppress such men—it ought to be a criminal offence to revert to type—the primordial gorilla.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But f?ather\u0027s a clever man—Albert always used to say so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, in a cunning, brutish sort of way—like a gorilla when he\u0027s set his heart on a particular cocoanut. Boarzell\u0027s his cocoanut, and he\u0027s done some smart things to get it—and in one way at least he\u0027s above the gorilla, for he can enslave other people of superior intelligence to sweat under his orders for what they care nothing about.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re all very unlucky,\" said Tilly, \"to have been born his children. But one by one we\u0027re gitting free. There\u0027ll soon be only Pete and Jemmy and Caro left.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I hope to God they\u0027ll have the wit to follow the rest of us. I\u0027d like to see that old slave-driver left quite alone. Heavens! I could have strangled him yesterday—I should have, if I hadn\u0027t had this to look forward to.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you going to stay in London?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miss Bardon\u0027s taken some rooms for me in Montague Street.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s good to you, Richard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s an angel \"—he lifted his eyes, and his mouth became almost worshipful—\"she\u0027s an angel, who\u0027s raised me out of hell. I shall never be able to repay her, but she doesn\u0027t expect it. All she wants is my success.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish Caro or Jemmy cud meet someone like her. I d?an\u0027t think as Pete minds.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, he\u0027s quite the young gorilla. Now I must be off, Tilly. I\u0027ll write to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, w?an\u0027t f?ather be in a taking!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I reckon—I expect he will. But don\u0027t you mind him, little sister. He isn\u0027t worth it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stooped and kissed her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-bye. Say it to the others for me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-bye—good luck to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ...
