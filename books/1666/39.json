Fear tripped up my heart as the stranger zeroed in on Hunter, but Hunter did nothing but cock his head like he was daring the younger Luxen to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he insane?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hunter,” I said, my voice sounding too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head snapped toward me, as did the Luxen’s. The light around his arm fizzled out and I swore the stranger’s mouth dropped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU SSSHOULDN’T HAVE COME OUT HERE . Hunter’s voice filtered through my thoughts. EVERYTHING ISSS okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything did not look okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything looked weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he’s one of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Luxen’s eyes widened and the eerie glow faded, revealing eyes that were an extraordinary green color, so bright and deep it reminded me of spring grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s head swung back to the Luxen and his chest rose as he took a step back. A second later, he was in his human form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Serena, go back to Luc’s office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, did he get off on bossing me around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed on me, and an instant later, the bouncer appeared out of nowhere and strode across the dance floor, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. “This really ain’t where ya need to be right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug in. “But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, I got some stuff to show you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s dark brows furrowed. “What stuff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncer winked over his shoulder. “Stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t given much of a choice. Seconds later, I was back in the office, angry at being bossed around, but also worried about what was happening out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a spot in front of the door, the bouncer folded his arms across his massive chest. “Those two ain’t gonna hurt each other, so you can relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelaxing was the last thing I was going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don’t look like they’re about to hug.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cracked a toothy grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That might be the truth, but that boy has got bigger problems than messing with an Arum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigger problems than you, to tell the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering how messed up my life was right now, I doubted that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncer unfurled his arms and scratched at his chin. A couple of moments passed and then he said, “They took his girl from him, and getting her back ain’t going to be easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot expecting that, I took a step back and plopped down on the couch. “Who took her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The government.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head churned that over. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne large shoulder rose in a shrug. “Why not? The gov does what it wants. So do the Luxen. So do the Arum.” He paused. “We’re in their world, babe. Don’t ya worry about the Luxen boy in there with Luc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorry about yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have a lot of time to mull those happy, happy words over. The door swung open and Hunter stalked in, totally unscathed. I started to get to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a hand. “I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see that. What was going on out there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing really,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe answered. The bouncer left the room and Hunter faced me. “He’s here to talk to Luc. It has nothing to do with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt guilty for the amount of relief that coursed through me. “It’s about…a girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter nodded, seeming distracted. “That’s what it sounds like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking about what the bouncer had said, I leaned back against the surprisingly comfortable cushion. “Why would they take her away? Did she find out what he was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why, but I’m thinking it’s more than that. Maybe he mutated her.” Hunter rubbed at his forehead. “Either way, if they’ve got her, then he has little hope of getting her out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a soft breath, saddened by the situation, even though the boy outside was a Luxen and I didn’t know them. Another life in shambles, and for what? I really didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I didn’t know anything anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting my head, I found Hunter watching me with a curious expression. “Yeah, that’s me. Human through and through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step toward me but stopped. “I didn’t mean that as an insult. I can see your sadness for them. You care for them even though you never met them. It is very human of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really didn’t know what to think of that. Empathy wasn’t something abnormal to me and I didn’t think it was such a strange notion to Hunter, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re more human than you realize, Hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he wished to argue, but the door opened once more and Luc prowled in, sending Hunter a sidelong glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should’ve stayed in here, Hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call me crazy, but I didn’t like the idea of a Luxen being here and me not knowing what was going down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc walked behind the desk and sat down. “You are crazy, but that has been established already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, let’s get this show on the road before I have more unexpected visitors crawling out of my ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows rose, but I wisely said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc opened up a door and pulled out a slender silver cuff. In the middle was a black, oval-shaped piece of opal with a red streak down the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed it over to Hunter, who snatched it out of the air with a flick of his wrist. I’d swear the moment Hunter slapped that cuff around his wrist, his cheeks brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know I don’t give these over easily. I’ve turned better allies away when they needed one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc paused. “Therefore this counts toward your one favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s gaze darkened. “That’s all I need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not true. You need a Luxen to feed from.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter cracked his neck to the side. “I can find a Luxen elsewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc smiled. “That would be unnecessary. I can work that out for you, provide a willing snack, but you’ll owe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Willing?” I glanced back and forth. “There’s Luxen willing to be fed off of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are Luxen willing to do anything for me,” Luc corrected. “And this way it will be much safer and quicker. Not to mention, you’re getting someone’s permission. That’s good karma, Hunter. You could use that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter scowled. “Yeah, and then I owe you. I know how this game works. No thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aw.” Luc feigned hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My favors aren’t that bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, and I’m secretly a cuddly rabbit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA broad grin crossed Luc’s face as he propped his elbows on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, all I would ask is for you to help me out in a time of need. That’s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgree to that and then I’ll bring someone in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy. Painless. You’ll be on your way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter opened his mouth, but I stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait. So you’d just need help one day? Help with what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever I may need help with,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this Luxen seriously won’t have a problem with Hunter feeding off him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, I had no idea what kind of whacked-out favors Luc could call in, but forcing a Luxen, no matter what their race had done, didn’t set well with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter met my stare and then cursed under his breath as he turned back to a positively beaming Luc. “Fine. Whatever. I’ll help you in your time of need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a breath as Luc rose and clapped his hands. “Great.” He pulled a phone out of his pocket, his fingers flying over the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This shouldn’t take long at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it that punk ass from outside?” Hunter started to smile. “Because I really would enjoy that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the young man with the fierce green eyes and doubted he’d agreed to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc laughed. “No. He’s got his hands full right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter looked disappointed, but a few moments later, he stilled and I knew a Luxen had arrived. The two headed to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should really stay in here this time,” Hunter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once, I listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the unlikely duo leave the office, I dropped my head into my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitnessing Hunter feed wasn’t high on my to-do list. There was already enough that reminded me of how different we truly were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Luxen Luc had brought in had been the typical arrogant fuck, but was surprisingly accommodating when it came to the feeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethinks he got off on the pain. Whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaw and pure energy coursed through me, amplified by the opal. If I didn’t do anything crazy with the borrowed energy, I’d be riding this wave for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Luxen scampered off, I turned to Luc. He leaned against the bar and folded his arms, giving me an arched look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged one shoulder. “So what’s the plan now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan—the fucking plan. I turned, shoving my hand through my hair. “I’m heading to Georgia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To your brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like a good idea. He knows how to stay off the radar.” He paused. “And what about Serena?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing Luc, I wondered why in the hell I was even considering talking to him about this. Then again, it was Luc, and weird shit always happened around him. “She wants to go back to Colorado.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something her friend left behind. It might be important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m assuming it has to do with what her friend overheard and the Luxen’s nefarious plans?” When I didn’t answer, Luc laughed softly. “If there’s evidence of that, it is important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, I doubt bringing such things to light would change anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you think Serena should go back there? Risk her life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc hopped up on the bar and let his legs dangle off. “I think it’s all rather pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvidence is important, but like I said, it ain’t going to change a damn thing. The DOD will shove their heads further into the sand or they’ll just go after Luxen who don’t have anything to do with this Project Eagle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “Is there really anything such as a good Luxen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there really such a thing as a good Arum?” he challenged. “I’m sure you would’ve considered your sister a good one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw locked down. “If you value your life at all, you will not ever speak of my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” He raised his hands. “All I am saying is that there are innocent baby aliens on both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that’s neither here nor there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou aren’t planning on accompanying Serena to Colorado?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. “I don’t have a death wish.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-39.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
