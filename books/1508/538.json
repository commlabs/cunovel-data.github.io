Using someone who was a hybrid to be a referee was much fairer to everyone involved.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Lan Xing fellow has already won two in a row.

I heard that he had a complete blowout just a year ago and gained ten whole slaughter points. After he came up to the second level he chose not to fight. Instead, he holed himself up and cultivated for an entire year. This is the first battle that he’s had since he came out!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He went into seclusion for an entire year? This fellow is quite terrifying, he actually has the patience to wait. Even a two winged Heavenly Demon master lasted less than 10 breaths of time under his hand.

This wasn’t even considering that everyone here was a genius that could jump ranks to fight.

Obviously, he had stepped up with the intention of regaining some honor for his companion. In Skysplit Tower, the races were very conscious about their own groups. When individuals of the same race fought, they wouldn’t kill each other often. But, if individuals of different races fought, then their every move would be ruthless.
