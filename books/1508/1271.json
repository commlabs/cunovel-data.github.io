Lin Ming hadn’t yet broken through the middle Divine Sea realm when he passed the tribulation at 80,000 feet.

This was because Lin Ming’s background was the most ordinary out of all these geniuses; he didn’t even come from a World King Holy Land. In terms of potential, he completely outclassed all Empyrean descendants of Vast Universe Heavenly Palace for the last 2 million years.
