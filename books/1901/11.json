Breathe shallow. Stand straight. Don\u0027t writhe. Within her laced regimen of behavior, she could handle one arrogant bean counter. What kind of accountant looked like this? There should be a hidden camera somewhere, a TV show prank. What kind of accountant. . . could do . . . that}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBracing his other arm so she was caged between them, Lucas had put his head down and brought his lips to the raised mounds. The tip of his tongue slid into the deep cleft. A teasing lick between the folds, barely touching ultrasensitive flesh, like a raindrop rolling down that tender crevice. His hair brushed her chin, her body somehow now canted into his so she could feel the pressure of it. All she had to do was lift her hands to slide across his broad shoulders, or put them inside the coat, to grip him at the waist. She\u0027d seen that hard, lean body almost naked, knew what was concealed beneath the clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe. Slow. Even. Stay in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed him away. Slap, hell. She punched him, though she was careful to choose the jaw and not the elegant nose or sweep of cheekbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire coursed through his gaze. For a blink, their deceptively civilized surroundings vanished and she thought he was going to wrest control from her, master her in truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake her down and fuck her right here on the carpet as a double-edged punishment. God help her, her response to the thought, the shameful need which she could feel trickling down her thigh, was just there waiting, making her even weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he brought himself under control. One corner of his mouth lifted. \"Nice jab. So who do you think won this round?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to touch where his lips had been on her breasts. She thought if she did, she would come, just from bringing their two energies together like that. Her pussy was beating insistently, as if it had its own heart. It knew exactly what it wanted, unlike the higher, supposedly more sophisticated, organ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pushed you away in ten seconds. I\u0027d say the round is definitely mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let you have that, because I wasn\u0027t watching the clock.\" He leaned back against the opposite side of the doorframe now, which put her standing between the stretch of his long legs. \"But if you make yourself come between now and the next time we see one another, the round will go to me. Because I\u0027ll know whom you\u0027re thinking about as you\u0027ve got your fingers in yourself. You won\u0027t use a vibrator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vibrators are far more efficient to deal with a passing urge,\" she said, tossing her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basic need fulfillment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"They are. But you\u0027ll use your fingers, sink them deep in your pussy, because you\u0027ll want the warmth of human flesh. Because you\u0027ll want to imagine it\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get over yourself,\" she advised, and stepped, graceful as a gazelle, over his polished shoes. As she headed down the hall, she knew she was fortunate not to have tripped and fallen, since her legs were less than steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie, your blouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave it a dismissive glance. He\u0027d opened one additional button, so only the leading edge of the satin cups of the corset was visible, though of course, what was most noticeable above that were her breasts, the glimpse of cleavage considerably expanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it wasn\u0027t porn, white trash level. It was as much as she might show if she was headed from the office to a night club to meet clients. It was way after five, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a problem with your boys getting the same view you got, seeing as they\u0027re not going to get a piece of it either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouldering her briefcase strap, she kept going. And was brought up short one step later as he clamped down on her arm, turned her so her back was flat against the wall. His eyes might have beautiful doll\u0027s lashes. He might be an accountant. But the dangerous expression in his face left no doubt he was a man, and a lot bigger and stronger than her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made her breath catch in her throat, a sound of desire, and of course, damn it all, he saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like the fact I can overpower you, don\u0027t you, Cass? That I don\u0027t let you get away with your freeze-out routine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off,\" she snapped. Even as it occurred to her that control was a very fine line when one was in the ring with a lion, with no whip or chair in reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as your blouse goes, I have a problem with it.\" His fingers brushed the tops of her breasts, making her bite her lip, which did nothing to control the shiver still rocketing through her. Sliding the button closed again, he smoothed his hands down the front of the blouse, over the tightly bound curves, her rib cage, to settle on her hips. He brushed his lips over hers. \"Do you smell yourself on my mouth? Just a faint trace from hours ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she closed her eyes, his lips moved to her nose, her temple. \"You like the challenge of me, Cass, but you\u0027re afraid to enjoy it. You don\u0027t want there to be anything in your life you can\u0027t control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a child, Lucas. There are things beyond my control. Beyond anyone\u0027s control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not your reaction. That\u0027s what the corset\u0027s about. To remind you that the rest of the world may be out of control, but you never will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra opened her eyes, stared up at him. \"Is that what you enjoy, Lucas? Kicking in people\u0027s doors, just to see if you can? I guess destroying mine gives you a real charge, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow creased. \"Cassie, what—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Cassandra, you arrogant ass.\" She pushed him, hard enough that she was able to take advantage of his surprise and jerk away. It may not have been the smoothest retreat, but it was a swift one. She made it to the relative safety of the admin area before he could catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was safe from him here. She just wasn\u0027t sure if she was safe from her vibrating body, her own dark urges, or her aching, confused heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt was signing some documents his admin had apparently left for him at her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter was sprawled, relaxed on the couch, tie already loosened, while Jon stood talking to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteady. Next chess move. Remarshalling her strategy, Cass painted on a cool smile, extended a hand to Matt. \"I\u0027ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Kensington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened and took it. She ignored the gooseflesh that his brief grip sliding over her skin gave her. Her hormones were in overdrive and Kensington was just too damned attractive. Like all of them. Despite the pheromones that radiated from his every gesture, she was pleased that at no time had she detected anything suggesting he wasn\u0027t entirely faithful to his wife. Of course, ironically, that would just enhance his appeal to women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Miss Moira. Though you\u0027re welcome to call me Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, but I find it best to keep business relationships on that level. It ensures professionalism and keeps our minds on getting the job done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It certainly does,\" he responded with a cryptic smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, Cass found Lucas in the hall doorway, hands in the pockets of his slacks, tawny hair falling over his forehead, enhancing the intent eyes. Tear the dress shirt open down the front, loosen the tie, and he could be a calendar pinup. A package that screamed sex, particularly the way he was studying her, calculating the meaning behind her every word and movement, figuring out how to dismantle everything she\u0027d tried to build for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah. She was going to have to hang in there, keep matching him, even as there was a part of her that wanted to run away or worse—not fight at all. Then she recalled his infuriating words about her, about why she wore the corset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink you know everything about me, Lucas? See if you predicted this, She turned to Ben. \"Mr. O\u0027Callahan, will you let me take you to dinner? Mr. Johnson would like to show his appreciation of your expeditious handling of the legal obstacles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Ben was surprised by the offer, he didn\u0027t show it. Giving her a sexy Irish smile, he plucked her light overcoat off the coat rack by Alice\u0027s desk. \"A business dinner that doesn\u0027t end up on Matt\u0027s tab. How can I refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. As he helped her into the coat, she delayed freeing her hair from the collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she expected, Ben loosed it, his hands sweeping it from beneath, knuckles brushing her neck as he let the clipped tail tumble down her right breast. While his touch produced an erotic ripple on her nape, she resented that the power of it seemed to come from the memory of Lucas\u0027s lips there, the way he\u0027d pushed her into climax a month ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just dinner,\" she added with a smile. \"I don\u0027t mix business with pleasure. While we\u0027re doing business, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, a carrot to get this deal closed as quickly as possible. I love a manipulative woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll see if I can get Lucas and Matt to hurry this all along, so I can find out if you\u0027re bluffing.\" Ben grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, gentlemen.\" She allowed him another practiced smile, the right amount of distance and warmth combined, promising nothing, and nodded to Matt, Jon, and Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she shifted over to Lucas. \"Until tomorrow, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d appreciate it if you were here at eight. So we can take care of the preliminary details we discussed. Don\u0027t be late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noted the clipped edge to his words, and how his attention was on Ben\u0027s hand, resting at the small of her back, a bit low. If his little finger dropped a millimeter, she suspected it would be on the top of her buttock. Giving her the temptation of more, with the most discreet of contacts. They must practice this. Keeping business and pleasure separate on the surface, but making it impossible for a woman to conduct the former without thinking of the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, nodded. Later tonight she\u0027d dissect her strategy for tomorrow. For now, she just wanted to be away from him, where her pussy didn\u0027t vibrate like a damn dinner bell every time he spoke, or leveled those eyes on her. Of course, that made her remember his earlier offer of dinner. What would it be like to take him to dinner, then take him home? Wake up with his smell around her, her face buried in his throat, body resting against the hard chest? Feel the cool metal of his medallion against her temple? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/controlled-response-knights-of-the-board-room-2/page-11.html","bookId":1901,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM"}
