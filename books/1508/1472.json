If I were to go then all I can rely on is this emperor jade I obtained from the City of Discord.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“But whether or not this emperor jade is a death-sparing token is something I cannot confirm!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming believed that if he entered Tragic Death Valley, he would surely have a certain advantage over others. But, how great this advantage would be was a mystery. The dangers inside Tragic Death Valley couldn’t be taken as a joke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming couldn’t help but cast his sense into the Magic Cube space. There, the emperor jade calmly floated. Its entire body was a deep green and covered in faint lines that gathered into endlessly diverse patterns. These patterns were similar to maps of God Burying Range.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming would absolutely go to Tragic Death Valley. To a martial artist, walking down the road of martial arts was originally choosing to struggle against the heavens every day. If there was the opportunity to obtain a heaven-shaking lucky chance, but he was too afraid to grab it because of his own fears and uncertainties then he would be doomed to never accomplish anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t want such a lucky chance to slip out from his hands. But, the key was how should he go and at what time in his life should he go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor instance, after breaking through to the Divine Lord realm, he would be able to escape the grasp of a World King powerhouse. If he reached the middle Divine Lord realm, he would have the strength to battle an ordinary World King.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll sorts of thoughts raced through Lin Ming’s mind. But at this time, the old imp in front of him was also growing impatient. “Hey, are the three of you done looking or not? Stop blocking the way, there are still many trial challengers behind you waiting to accept a mission!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old imp said without a trace of humor in his tone. Lin Ming thought for a moment, not minding the harsh manner of the old imp. Instead, he took out a jade slip filled with origin energy runes from his spatial ring and handed it over to the old imp. Lin Ming had traded for these origin energy runes at the City of Discord using nine sun jades.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old imp was surprised. He used his calloused hands to rub the jade slip and immediately estimated the amount of origin energy runes within it. This was definitely a considerable wealth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“W-what do you want?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I will take this mission; you can keep the remaining origin energy runes. I just want you to answer something for me. What should I pay attention to if I want to go to God Burying Ridge?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was speaking the old imp lit up with a smile. He glanced around to see if anyone was looking at him and then put away the origin energy rune jade slip. He said, “You’re a smart one. There are many adventurers that come here and, without knowing anything at all, rush towards God Burying Ridge to never return, instead dying there. Hehe, this is the perfect question that you asked me today. In God Burying Ridge, there are many things that you have to pay attention to, but only those with experience know about them. As for these experiences, they are gathered using the lives of those that have gone before. Those that know will not speak of it easily, and even if they do they might not be clear about it. Go to the west city and look for Fatty Zhou, Zhou Shiyan. If you put forth a high enough reward he will lead you to God Burying Ridge. But, let me tell you something ahead of time. The total travel fee should be around a million origin energy runes. If you pay more, then you’ll have been tricked by him!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old imp said with blinking eyes. Lin Ming found this understandable. With a guide leading the way, it would definitely be much safer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Eh… do the three of you really want to go to God Burying Ridge? With your current cultivations, going to God Burying Ridge is the same as throwing a meat bun to a dog. You won’t return at all!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old imp cautioned as he saw Lin Ming and the others about to walk away. He did so only because of the origin energy runes he was given.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming casually said, “Our team also has some masters, so you don’t need to worry about us.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing Lin Ming about to leave Black God Fort, the old imp shook his head, “Having masters to protect you is useless. That God Burying Ridge is far too strange. The dangers are specifically aimed at each person. Sometimes, even those with high cultivations will still die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDangers specifically aimed at each person?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s footsteps paused for a moment, “Thank you, I understand now.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, he left Black God Fort with Xiao Moxian. As the old imp looked at Lin Ming’s fading back, he shook his head. He knew that youngsters like them wouldn’t listen to his advice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This year, how could there be so many people sending themselves to their deaths?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old imp rambled to himself. But at this time, Lin Ming and the others had already left Black God Fort. They planned to go to the west city and look for this Zhou Shiyan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You’re sure you want to go?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Monster Prince Duyu left Black God Fort, he didn’t continue walking. Instead, his gloomy eyes stared at Xiao Moxian. “Junior-apprentice Sister, do you really want to go to God Burying Ridge with some unknown fellow? That is an extremely dangerous place so you should be afraid that others will harm you! Do you know that you have…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Monster Prince Duyu spoke to here he suddenly stopped. His malice-filled eyes turned towards Lin Ming, overflowing with killing intent. He simply hadn’t used a true essence sound transmission to speak just then, and was plainly speaking in front of Lin Ming. It was clear that he was finally fed up with Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming knew what Monster Prince Duyu’s final words were going to be. He was referring to her phoenix bloodline. She possessed the flesh and blood of a true God Beast. In the past, within the Ancient Phoenix Clan, a single drop of phoenix blood essence was unimaginably valuable. From this alone, one could see how precious Xiao Moxian’s body was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf someone with evil thoughts captured her, they could make good use of her. Whether it was using her body to cultivate, or using her for alchemy, one could obtain inestimable benefits.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“How can a man be so nagging? If you don’t want to go then you can stay in the city and wait for us to return.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat Xiao Moxian couldn’t stand the most was others continuously badgering her into changing her mind. During this trip through the Asura Road, Monster Prince Duyu had done so repeatedly. She was already sick and tired of him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHearing Xiao Moxian’s words, Monster Prince Duyu was angry to the point of vomiting blood, but he simply didn’t have any means to change her mind. He continued to glare at Lin Ming. If looks could kill, Lin Ming would have died 100 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu grit his teeth and ultimately decided to follow them. Old Blue’s wounds weren’t fully healed yet, and even if he were to recover he still needed to undo the tracking rune on him. For a time, he couldn’t be counted on to provide any help.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf he were to lose Xiao Moxian and return himself, there was no way he could explain what happened. Moreover, he was worried about allowing Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian to go together. If something happened between the two of them, he would regret it for the rest of his life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I might not have an accident if I go to God Burying Ridge. Perhaps there might be a lucky chance for me also.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu thought, comforting himself. He followed behind Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian, eventually arriving at the west city. After making several inquiries, they located that Zhou Shiyan the old imp told them about.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Shiyan lived in a three-story building. This building was formed with expensive array formations, and the back garden was planted with all sorts of spirit flowers. It looked beautiful and refined, as if spring was blossoming here all year round.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Zhou Shiyan is quite wealthy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thought to himself. In Heavendevil City, the value of land was high enough to give one a seizure. Back in the City of Discord, the price of a house was enough to cause an ordinary Divine Lord powerhouse to feel powerless and desperate, but in Heavendevil City, land was several times more expensive. If this Zhou Shiyan could live in a relatively large house in Heavendevil City, this proved that he had some skills.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It looks like this Zhou Shiyan is fairly reliable. If he can gather such wealth it is likely related to God Burying Ridge. If he really is familiar with the situation around God Burying Ridge then whether it is as a guide, or hunting for treasures himself, he can likely make a fortune doing so.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming entered the small building. As he did so, array formations immediately appeared, blocking him. To Lin Ming, these array formations weren’t anything at all. However, he still stood with manners and poise outside of the array formation, waiting for the master of the house to come out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, a fat man in a blue robe appeared at the entrance. This fellow was half a head shorter than Lin Ming and his entire body was plump, brimming with health and vitality. His chins were pushed together and his two small and bright eyes looking at Lin Ming and the others, filled with happiness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Are you here to discuss business?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm. We want to go to God Burying Ridge!” Lin Ming went straight to the point.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“God Burying Ridge? Good! It seems that you little fellows are becoming increasingly brave. Three Divine Transformation youths want to go to God Burying Ridge? Well, let me tell you ahead of time that I will only be guiding you there. Your life or death will be in your own hands!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I understand.” Although Lin Ming had a rough map, he still didn’t know which route to enter God Burying Ridge was the safest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Each person will be 2 million origin energy runes. If all three of you are going, then I’ll give you a discount and charge you 5 million.” Fatty Zhou stretched out his palm and showed five thick and short fingers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“3 million, no more, no less.” Lin Ming replied. Although he didn’t care about an extra 2 million origin energy runes, he didn’t want to put on a display of stupidity, otherwise others would treat him as a fool. At that time, they might try to deliberately trick him and lead him into some dangerous situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, it looks like you’ve already considered the price beforehand.” After being exposed by Lin Ming, Fatty Zhou laughed, not embarrassed at all. “Deal!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1466\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1468\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1467","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM"}
