The time when in the past I was often in meditation, tired, and half in love with the changing sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bathed slowly and carefully, the small bathroom full of dim light and steam around me. My head was clear, and I felt happiness, as if the sheer respite from sickness was a form of joy. I shaved my face slowly, until it was perfectly smooth, and then, delving into the little cabinet behind the mirror, I found what I wanted-the little rubber sheaths that would keep her safe from me, from my planting a child within her, from this body giving her some other dark seed that might harm her in ways I could not foresee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious little objects, these-gloves for the organ. I would love to have thrown them away, but I was determined that I would not make the mistakes I had made before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently, I shut the little mirror door. And only then did I see a telegram message taped above it-a rectangle of yellowed paper with the words in pale indistinct print:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eORKTCHEN, COME BACK, WE NEED YOU. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe date of the communication was very recent-only a few days before. And the origin was Caracas, Venezuela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI approached the bed, careful not to make a sound, and I laid the small safety devices on the table in readiness, and I lay with her again, and began to kiss her tender sleeping mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, I kissed her cheeks, and the flesh beneath her eyes. I wanted to feel her eyelashes through my lips. I wanted to feel the flesh of her throat. Not for killing, but for kissing; not for possession, but for this brief physical union that will take nothing from either one of us; yet bring us together in a pleasure so acute it is like pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waked slowly under my touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust in me, I whispered. I won\u0027t hurt you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, but I want you to hurt me, she said in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, I pulled the flannel gown off her. She lay back looking up at me, her breasts as fair as the rest of her, the areolas of her nipples very small and pink and the nipples themselves hard. Her belly was smooth, her hips broad. A lovely dark shadow of brown hair lay between her legs, glistening in the light coming through the windows. I bent down and kissed this hair. I kissed her thighs, parting her legs with my hand, until the warm inside flesh was open to me, and my organ was stiff and ready. I looked at the secret place there, folded and demure and a dark pink in its soft veil of down. A coarse warm excitement went through me, further hardening the organ. I might have forced her, so urgent was the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no, not this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved up, beside her, turning her face to me, and accepting her kisses now, slow and awkward and fumbling. I felt her leg pressed against mine, and her hands moving over me, seeking the warmth beneath my armpits, and the damp nether hair of this male body, thick and dark. It was my body, ready for her and waiting. This, my chest, which she touched, seeming to love its hardness. My arms, which she kissed as if she prized their strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passion in me ebbed slightly, only to grow hot again instantly, and then to die down again, waiting, and then to rise once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo thoughts came to me of the blood drinking; no thought at all of the thunder of the life inside her which I might have consumed, a dark draught, at another time. Rather the moment was perfumed with the soft heat of her living flesh. And it seemed vile that anything could harm her, anything mar the common mystery of her-of her trust and her yearning and her deep and common fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my hand slip down to the little doorway; how sorry and sad that this union would be so partial, so brief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as my fingers gently tried the virgin passage, her body caught fire. Her breasts seemed to swell against me, and I felt her open, petal by petal, as her mouth grew harder against my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what of the dangers: didn\u0027t she care about them In her new passion, she seemed heedless, and completely under my command. I forced myself to stop, to remove the little sheath from its packet, and to roll it up and over the organ, as her passive eyes remained fixed on me, as if she no longer had a will of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this surrender that she needed, it was what she required of herself. Once again, I fell to kissing her. She was moist and ready for me. I could keep it back no longer, and when I rode her now, it was hard. The little passage was snug and maddeningly heated as its juices flowed. I saw the blood come up into her face as the rhythm quickened; I bent my lips to lick at her nipples, to claim her mouth again. When the final moan came out of her, it was like the moan of pain. And there it was again, the mystery-that something could be so perfectly finished, and complete, and have lasted such a little while. Such a precious little while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad it been union Were we one with each other in this clamorous silence\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think that it was union. On the contrary, it seemed the most violent of separations: two contrary beings flung at each other in heat and clumsiness, in trust and in menace, the feelings of each unknowable and unfathomable to the other-its sweetness terrible as its brevity; its loneliness hurtful as its \u0027undeniable fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd never had she looked so frail to me as she did now, her eyes closed, her head turned into the pillow, her breasts no longer heaving but very still. It seemed an image to provoke violence-to beckon to the most wanton cruelty in a male heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was this so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want any other mortal to touch her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want her own guilt to touch her. I didn\u0027t want regret to hurt her, or for any of the evils of the human mind to come near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd only now did I think of the Dark Gift again, and not of Claudia, but of the sweet throbbing splendour in the making of Gabrielle. Gabrielle had never looked back from that long-ago moment. Clad in strength and certainty, she had begun her wandering, never suffering an hour\u0027s moral torment as the endless complexities of the great world drew her on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who could say what the Dark Blood would give to any one human soul And this, a virtuous woman, a believer in old and merciless deities, drunk on the blood of martyrs and the heady suffering of a thousand saints. Surely she would never ask for the Dark Gift or accept it, any more than David would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what did such questions matter until she knew the words I spoke were true And what if I could never prove their truth to her What if I never had the Dark Blood again inside me to give anyone and I remained forever trapped in this mortal flesh I lay quiet, watching the sunlight fill the room. I watched it strike the tiny body of the crucified Christ above her bookshelf; I watched it fall upon the Virgin with her bowed head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnuggled against each other, we slept again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-body-thief-the-vampire-chronicles-4/page-16.html","bookId":2212,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:22 PM"}
