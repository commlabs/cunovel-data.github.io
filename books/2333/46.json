The only element he doesn\u0027t contemplate with delight, he realizes, is the massage part. He doesn\u0027t want anybody touching him, doesn\u0027t want to be aroused sexually. He just wants to see the look in her eyes as the knife slides home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not thinking clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, at least, is clear to him. He has been walking around, turning left, turning right, walking into shops, looking around, walking out. He\u0027s looking for something and doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s looking for, and he\u0027s not thinking clearly, that\u0027s it in a nutshell, and in the process he\u0027s placing himself at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches into his shirt, touches his amulet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd knows what he has to do. He has to go home and lie down, he has to take a Valium, he has to get some rest. He has had a very busy day, and his energy levels are depleted, and he\u0027s got to allow them to replenish themselves. A hot bath, a glass of Harold Fischer\u0027s excellent single-malt Scotch, a Valium, and eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. That\u0027s what he needs, and what he\u0027s going to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps to the curb, holds up his hand, and two taxis dart across several lanes of traffic, eager to take him wherever he wants to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rewards the one who gets there first, gives his address, sinks back into the cushions. He touches the handle of his knife, touches the rhodochrosite circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower and clarity. He\u0027s feeling better already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Central Park West, a block and a half short of his destination, the taxi stops for a red light. Without planning it, without any forethought whatsoever, he says, \"I\u0027ll get out here,\" and takes money from his billfold. They\u0027re not at the curb, there\u0027s a lane of traffic to the right of his taxi, but no matter. He stuffs money into the pass-through compartment of the partition, ignores the driver\u0027s protest, and gets out. There\u0027s a red light, no one\u0027s going anywhere, and it\u0027s easy enough to walk between a couple of cars and reach the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, though?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a reason, he\u0027s certain of it, and so he keeps his eyes open and his wits about him as he proceeds north for a block on the side of the avenue bordering the park. And, when he\u0027s covered half the distance, he knows why he didn\u0027t let the taxi take him to his door. He doesn\u0027t know what warned him, what subtle observation inspired that inner prompting, but he can hardly question it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause his building is swarming with policemen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are police cars parked all over the place- at a hydrant, in a bus stop, in a no-parking zone around the corner. Is there a fire truck on the scene? An ambulance? No, nothing but police cars. And there\u0027s a uniformed patrolman standing in the entrance, talking with the doorman. And there\u0027s a man who\u0027s not wearing a uniform, but might as well be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan he spot a film truck? Are there any barriers set up to hold back the crowd? They are forever filming things in this city, movies, television episodes, along with New York exteriors for shows ostensibly set here but actually filmed in Los Angeles, and much of what they film involves crime and the police. Walk into an apparent hostage situation and you\u0027re likely to spot Jerry Orbach, looking more like a cop than the cops do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jerry Orbach\u0027s not here. No one\u0027s filming this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all over, he realizes. He knows without the slightest doubt that he\u0027s the reason for the presence of all these policemen. And it\u0027s not one cop, come to ask him a few questions. It\u0027s a whole slew of them, several vehicles\u0027 worth, and that means they\u0027ve been in the apartment, and yes, of course, they\u0027ve read what\u0027s on his computer, they could hardly have failed to do so, and they\u0027ll have long since discovered the wretched little masseuse tucked in her wretched little cupboard, and, well, what is there to say? It\u0027s over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they\u0027re waiting for him, standing there waiting for him, and if he hadn\u0027t somehow known to get out of the cab when he did, he\u0027d have waltzed right into their arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027s been given a second chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heads for the parking garage to collect his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou get what you get, he thinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s up to you what you make of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thinks of alt.crime.serialkillers. He\u0027ll have his own thread, won\u0027t he? Have whole Web sites devoted to him and his exploits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how many cops will spend how many hours searching for him? There are no photos of him, he\u0027s seen to that. Family photos, high school yearbook photos, but he had another name then, and no one searching for Adam Breit will know that name, or have access to those photos. They can run all the sketches they please on America\u0027s Most Wanted. It won\u0027t do them any good. He\u0027ll watch the program with new friends in Spokane or St. Paul and shake his head and sigh with the rest of them. \"What a sick son of a bitch,\" he\u0027ll say. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing him hang. I\u0027d pull on the rope myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting for a light to change, he drops his hand to his side and feels the knife, then reaches up to touch his amulet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thinks of the people who love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist, they\u0027re going to hear about this, and it\u0027s going to shatter them. Peter and Ruth Ann and Lucian and Marsha and Kieran, his whole little family, and what are they going to think? How are they going to feel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can\u0027t leave them like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls out of line, wrenches the wheel all the way around, hears brakes squeal behind him as he makes a U-turn in front of oncoming traffic. Horns sound in reproach, but he scarcely hears them. He heads for Delancey Street, and the Williamsburg Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he in time? Will they welcome him with the love that is their greatest gift to him? Or will he walk through the door only to see fear and horror on their faces?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brakes at the curb, leaps out from behind the wheel, dashes across to the front entrance. The door\u0027s unlocked and he flings it open, and there\u0027s Kieran and Ruth Ann, looking up from their work, and there\u0027s big Peter over to the side, chipping away at plaster. And what is it on their faces? Shock?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, it\u0027s surprise, and of course they\u0027re surprised, because they were not expecting a visit from him. But it\u0027s a good surprise, he sees. They\u0027re delighted, their faces glow with love. \"Doc!\" they cry. \"Doc, what are you doing here? Doc, it\u0027s so good to see you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes the rounds, embraces them in turn, and when he and Peter have finished their hug he hears footsteps on the stairs, and turns to see Marsha and Lucian, beaming, radiant, coming to join the party. Everybody\u0027s here, his whole family, and how could he have possibly driven off and left them, these five dear people who love him so? How could he even have considered it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he thinking of?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Wentworth called I was back home watching a ball game. Elaine was getting dinner ready and T J was at her computer, doing something that would enable her to perform more efficiently some task she\u0027d lived all her life without doing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d called the Hollander house earlier and told Kristin\u0027s machine I wanted to speak to Ballou. When he picked up I told him the police guard was in place, and he could probably leave if he wanted to. He said he\u0027d long since spotted them through the window, and you could very likely march an army past them without getting their attention. He\u0027d stay where he was, if it was all the same to me. The wee girl was a good cook, and she\u0027d found a cribbage board, and he\u0027d taught her to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Cribbage? I didn\u0027t know you played.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s much you don\u0027t know,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t argue the point. I went back to the baseball game, where a Met pitcher was struggling. He was earning five million dollars this year, and so far he\u0027d won two more games than he\u0027d lost. I found myself wondering what kind of money Bob Gibson would get in today\u0027s market, or Carl Hubbell, or-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and it was Ira Wentworth, wanting to know if I was busy. I told him my wife was fixing dinner and I was watching a ball game. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been in on all of this,\" he said, \"and I figure you earned the right to see the rest of it. But I have to say you\u0027re better off staying where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t follow you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t follow myself,\" he said. \"You want to come, be out in front of your building in five minutes. I\u0027ll swing by and pick you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine was planning to make pasta, and I caught her before the water boiled and told her she was cooking for one. \"Then I\u0027ll just have a salad,\" she said, \"and we can eat when you get home, if you\u0027re still hungry. Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her I didn\u0027t know. I got T J away from the computer and we went downstairs. A minute or two after we hit the pavement, a Ford about three years old made an illegal U-turn in the middle of the block and pulled up right in front of us. I opened the door and was about to compliment Wentworth on his driving, but the expression on his face stopped me. I got in next to him and T J got in back and the car took off before we had the doors shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m in such a rush. Nobody\u0027s going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he, holed up somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a manner of speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have hostages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, but there was no humor in it. \"Same answer,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything, and he turned at Broadway, slowed down long enough at a red light to make sure there was no oncoming traffic, then coasted through the intersection. He drove like a cop, trying not to hit anybody, but otherwise unconcerned about the traffic laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Times Square he switched to Broadway. As we approached Thirty-fourth Street he said, \"You\u0027re not going to ask where we\u0027re going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured you\u0027d tell me sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brooklyn,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coney Island Avenue? He went back there after all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything. At Thirty-first Street two cars stood side by side at a red light, waiting patiently for it to change. Wentworth swung around them, shot across the intersection, cut back in. Somebody leaned on his horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why the hell they do that,\" he said. \"Hit their horns. Time they do that, I\u0027m already out of their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they had guns,\" I said, \"they wouldn\u0027t have to honk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An armed driver is a quiet driver,\" he said. \"What I\u0027m doing, I\u0027ll cut over Houston to Forsyth or Eldridge. Whichever one\u0027s southbound. Take that to Delancey and shoot over the bridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong bridge,\" I said. \"If you take the Manhattan Bridge it\u0027s a straight shot down Flatbush Avenue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the geography lesson,\" he said, \"but that\u0027s not where we\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how much of it I knew then. Enough, at least, to keep my mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeading east on Houston Street he said, \"Somebody mentioned the boyfriend. I forget his name, if I ever heard it in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter Meredith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody mentioned him back at Breit\u0027s apartment, and I was going to call somebody in Brooklyn, see about getting a car and a couple of uniforms out there. But then I thought somebody else was gonna take care of it, and it was way down on the list, you know? They were patients of his, but he\u0027s a doctor, a therapist, whatever the hell he is, you figure he\u0027s got a whole file cabinet full of patients, right? What are you gonna do, go sit on each and every one of them on the chance he might show up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire,\" he said. \"Place went up like a fucking film warehouse. Meserole Street? Couple of blocks from Bushwick Terminal? Isn\u0027t that where you said it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t recall the street number, by any chance?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-46.html","bookId":2333,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM"}
