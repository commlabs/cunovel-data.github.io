Hadn’t anyone else been able to see Allie’s lack of talent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had Allie Kramer’s name ever been whispered for an Academy Award?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, cooler, smarter heads had prevailed and Allie hadn’t been nominated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was late. So late! Consumed by her whirling thoughts and a darkness she didn’t want to consider, Cassie arrived at the bar over an hour later than she’d planned. Once she’d snapped to and seen the time on her car’s clock, she’d texted Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo surprise there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news was that at this time of night Orson’s was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lighting was dim, soft jazz playing from hidden speakers, only a few customers sprinkled at the bar and even fewer at the surrounding tables. Cassie figured McNary had picked this spot specifically because the patrons were sparse so there was less of a chance of someone recognizing him. Maybe. With all of the publicity surrounding the release of Dead Heat, and the scandal surrounding the movie, anyone associated with the film was under the constant watch of the paparazzi. Didn’t she have the phone calls, texts, and e-mails to prove it? Fortunately, there were fewer members of the press in Portland than LA, but that would change quickly with news of the premiere party that Dean Arnette had scheduled, here, in the City of Roses for this coming weekend. And these days, everyone had a cell phone, pocket camera, or iPad on them at all times. Any Tom, Dick, or Harriet could snap a shot and sell it to the tabloids, or post it on the Internet. No big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe odd thing was that usually McNary didn’t avoid publicity. He ate up all of the media attention and with Dead Heat about to be released, it seemed out of character for him to want privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo something had to be up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over her shoulder, but no one seemed to pay her any notice as she walked into the restaurant. Her hair was pulled away from her face and hidden beneath her hood. She’d wiped off all of her makeup to be less recognizable. A scarf, ostensibly to fight off the cold and damp of April in Oregon, hid her chin, but she didn’t wear dark glasses. At night they would attract more attention than they would deflect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she picked a path through scattered tables, she sensed a couple of passing glances sent her way, but no one stopped to stare or interrupt their conversation as she made her way to a corner booth. She ordered a glass of wine, and still fighting a headache texted Trent while her cell flashed its irritating “low battery” warning. For now she ignored it, but she’d have to be careful. She needed the phone in case of an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Portland. McNary said he had info on Allie. We’ll see. Back soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she waited. Five minutes. Ten. Fifteen. Sipping her merlot she checked her watch. God, it was late. Her fault. Still, she was annoyed that McNary wasn’t showing. Avoiding eye contact with the patrons and waiter, she did a slow burn as she told herself she’d been stood up. She was an idiot, a fool for trusting the likes of Brandon McNary. She should never have left Trent’s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly McNary swung through the door and headed straight to her table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmelling of rainwater and cigarette smoke, wearing a hooded jacket not unlike her own, and with four or five days’ beard stubble and tinted glasses, he was barely recognizable. He looked more like a strung-out junkie down on his luck than a Hollywood star who could command millions to be a part of a movie. “About time you showed,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. Just pay for that,” he said, motioning toward her drink, and when she was about to argue, he pulled out his wallet as if agitated, left a couple of bills on the table, then grabbed her hand. Before she could protest, he bent down and whispered, “Don’t argue,” then quietly led her down a short hallway and through a side entrance to the street, where beneath the awnings several men and women smoked cigarettes, the rain coming down in a steady drizzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we going?” Cassie demanded. She’d never trusted McNary and she wasn’t going to follow him blindly down the dark Portland streets in the middle of the damned night, not when her sister was already missing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-116.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
