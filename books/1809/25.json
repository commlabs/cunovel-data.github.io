Because if there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s give as good as I get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kennedy Randy Randolph.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile drops like a barrel over Niagara Falls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My middle name is Suzanne.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I never did come up with a nickname for you. Though we already considered Randy, didn’t we? It wasn’t a good fit—I’ll keep working on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, checking her out all over again. Because now that I know who she is, we’re talking a whole other level of depraved interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamn. You look—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know.” She sighs, then gazes at her manicure in that bitchy way women do. “Thank you.” There’s not a shred of sincerity in her tone—like she’s heard a million compliments before. Which, with her level of hotness, is possible. Except for one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d you do to your eyes?” I lean in, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re called contact lenses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, take them out. I don’t like them. Your real eyes are incredible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathtaking, actually—deep, warm brown with flecks of gold. I’d know Kennedy’s eyes anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d you do to your face?” she asks, folding her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch my chin. “I grew a beard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well ungrow it. It looks like a vagina from a 1970s porn film.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips twitch—because, fuck, the things that come out of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starting to get the impression you don’t like me anymore, sweetness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChallenge rises in her eyes. “You’re assuming I actually liked you to begin with. You know what they say about people who assume, ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI square off against Kennedy. Game on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You definitely liked me. Remember that summer you flashed me your boobs? That has to count for something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not flash you my boobs.” She scowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You totally did. They were the first I’d ever seen—made an indelible impression.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinds her teeth. “I jumped in the pool and my bathing suit rode up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it was a Freudian Nip Slip. Subconsciously, you meant to do it, because you liked me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’re a pompous bastard. Possibly a sociopath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin. “Doesn’t mean you didn’t like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver Kennedy’s shoulder, I catch my mother’s eager gaze on us. She’d be less obvious if she had a spotlight and binoculars aimed our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother’s watching us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy places her empty glass on the tray of a passing waiter and picks up a full one. “Of course she’s watching us. For years, her greatest wish was that I’d grow up to bear your spawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort. “That’s ridiculous.” Then I glance sideways at Kennedy, gauging her reaction. “Isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Completely.” She looks me straight in the face. “I could never be with someone like you—you have the maturity of a twelve-year-old boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my glass. “And you have the chest of one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expect her to come back with a clever, biting retort, but she just gestures to me with an open palm. “I rest my case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIronically, my first instinct is to stick my tongue out at her. But I won’t give her the satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides,” she adds with a haughty smile. “I’m seeing someone. Maybe you’ve heard of him? David Prince.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Prince is a junior senator from Illinois with his eye on the White House. He’s a rock star, the second coming of John F. Kennedy. I bet the entire Democratic Party and a good percentage of Republicans have his picture hanging on their office wall—the same way that poster of a feather-haired Jon Bon Jovi hung on the bedroom walls of all sixteen of my girl cousins’. And two of the boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re dating a politician?” I say it like it’s a dirty word, because in my experience politicians are rarely clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raises a perfectly manicured eyebrow. “You were almost a politician.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only in my father’s wet dreams,” I volley back. “Although, you always said you were going to marry a prince. Sounds like you’re on your way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother said that—not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk. “Then she must be ecstatic. You’re finally everything she always wanted you to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame. Set. Match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething shifts in Kennedy’s eyes, and I suddenly get the feeling we’re not playing anymore. “Not everything. Mother wanted me to be a ballerina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears ago, I’d heard she was doing undergrad at Brown University. But other than that tiny detail there’s been nothing. Her father is a talker, her mother a bragger, but when Kennedy dropped off the grid after boarding school, information on her locked up like Fort Knox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what you were doing in Las Vegas—dancing? Kind of short for a showgirl, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I’d be sitting front and center for that show if I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods slowly, smiling way too smugly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-a-wonderful-tangled-christmas-carol-tangled-4-5/page-25.html","bookId":1809,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:59 PM"}
