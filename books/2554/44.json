Yep, the Doppler map showed the first green bands of the storm hitting Long Island\u0027s South Fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered about getting snowed in. Wouldn\u0027t that mess up Jack\u0027s plans? She\u0027d worry about that when the time came. Nobody seemed totally sure of how much was going to fall anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she turned back to the window, she thought she saw movement near the house. She grabbed the binoculars and scanned the property through the scattered flakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere - in the yard, on the bay side, a gray-haired woman in a coat was crouched by the bulkhead. Dawn adjusted the focus to sharpen her features and confirm what she\u0027d already guessed. She knew that hatchet face, totally recognized that toadlike body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands tightened on the binoculars. Gilda ... how happy she must be. She hated Dawn, and taking charge of Dawn\u0027s stolen child must have given her incalculable pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was she doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn focused on her hands as they pulled bits of greenery from the stones in the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeeding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why would she be out weeding? And in the blustery snow? Had she totally lost her mind? She had a two-week-old baby inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn awful thought struck like a blow: What if she didn\u0027t? What if they didn\u0027t have the baby over there? What if there was no baby? What if he\u0027d died, just as Dr. Landsman had said?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe what-ifs filled her head, reverberating across her brain until -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait-wait-wait. Dr. Heinze ... only one reason a pediatrician would visit that house: a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then why, if she had a baby inside under her care, was Gilda out in the yard, pulling weeds in the snow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething totally wrong here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if Dawn and Weezy and Jack were all wrong, and there was no baby in that house, they were all wasting their time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe focused again on Gilda, still crouched, still weeding. She tracked over to the dock. Empty. Back to Gilda: weeding. Then to the front door: The glass-paned storm door was closed but the paneled inner door stood open. Georges hadn\u0027t closed it on his way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought a terrible urge to go over there and check it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall Weezy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed her phone and called Weezy from her contact list. She heard a strange ring tone coming from downstairs. She hurried down and found a phone charging on the kitchen counter. Its display read Dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn ended her call and hurried for the front door. She didn\u0027t stop to find her coat, simply pushed out and trotted across the street through the wind and cold and swirling flakes toward the mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to do anything stupid like take the baby. That would upset all of Jack\u0027s plans. He\u0027d made it clear that if Dawn was ever going to be able to keep her baby in peace, Mr. Osala had to be stopped - she hadn\u0027t asked for clarification on exactly what he\u0027d meant by \"stopped.\" She hadn\u0027t really wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had totally wanted her out of sight for fear she\u0027d be recognized. But Georges was out fishing on the bay and Gilda was out in the yard on the far side of the house. Nobody around to recognize her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo ... nothing so stupid as taking the baby, but she wanted - needed - to make sure the baby was there. Once she established that, she\u0027d totally run back to the O\u0027Donnell place and let Jack work his plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost to the front door when the possibility of a third adult in the house slowed her. But even if it were true, what were the odds of him or her recognizing Dawn? Only Gilda and Georges knew her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up speed again and bounded up the two steps to the front door. She cupped her hands around her face as she leaned close and peered through the storm glass. The central hall ran directly into the great room Jack had mentioned. Looking straight ahead she could see all the way to the window wall and the churning bay beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to rap gently on the glass to see if anyone responded when she heard a piercing shriek from within. It jolted her. She\u0027d never heard anything like it - high-pitched and thin, like it came from a little throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be the baby. Was it in pain? Had that bitch been mistreating him because he was Dawn\u0027s? She had to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteeling herself, she tested the latch. It moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, she had to do this. Just a look - just one look. She pulled open the door, slipped inside, and eased it closed behind her. She stood there listening. Somewhere a television was playing. She tiptoed forward toward the great room and peeked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked through the window wall and saw Gilda, still outside, still pulling weeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow where - ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screech startled her, almost buckled her knees. So loud!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came from behind her and to the left. She backed up and found a door ajar. She pushed it open ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and froze, staring, not sure of what she was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crib with a child ... a small child wearing a dark blue, sleeveless onesy ... very small ... only two feet tall, if that ... but standing in the crib. Standing. Should a child that small be able to stand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet there he stood, gripping the bars, staring at her with his black eyes. He had wild black hair shooting straight out from his scalp, a flat nose and nearly lipless mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose eyes ... she recognized those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he opened his mouth and loosed an ear-splitting shriek that rocked Dawn back on her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only for a second. She moved closer, slowly, so as not to startle him. His eyes never moved from her face. She looked at his sturdy little legs. They seemed covered with black stubble. And his hands where he gripped the rails of the crib - his fingernails looked more like black claws, and might have been sharp but they\u0027d been trimmed back. He opened his mouth and shrieked again - a nerve-wracking sound - and Dawn thought she saw glimmers of white along his gums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth? Already? Whoever heard of a baby teething at two weeks? And yet ... was that why he was shrieking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her child. Dawn knew it as surely as she knew her own name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s alive. My baby is alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where were the tentacles she\u0027d seen? She leaned left and right for a look at what little she could see of his armpits, but no sign of a tentacle in either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Maybe she\u0027d been wrong about the tentacles. She\u0027d been sure she\u0027d seen two little tendrils like wriggling garter snakes right after she delivered, but she\u0027d been pretty stressed out then, and frankly, being wrong about the tentacles was totally okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to stare at her, as if she were the most fascinating thing he had ever seen. She had to smile. With no one else to look at but Gilda and Georges, maybe she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, this was her baby, but ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d expected this totally overwhelming surge of maternal love when she saw him, but it hadn\u0027t come. She felt more curiosity than anything. And she had to ask herself: Did she really want him back? She knew she should, and she wanted to want him, but she couldn\u0027t help it: The maternal urge wasn\u0027t there. He was like some creature ... the result of combining all the bad DNA that had been bred into her and into the baby\u0027s father. Her baby was alive, he was well - already standing, for God\u0027s sake - and looked like he was being well treated. Could she do better? Should she try?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed away. She\u0027d assumed the decision would be easy, automatic, but it wasn\u0027t. She\u0027d have to give this some thought. No, more than some - a lot of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she turned away toward the door, she heard a whimper. She looked back and saw him still standing there with his little arms stretched out toward her. Did he recognize her as his mother? Could that be possible? She felt a sudden impulse to rush to him but fought it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she whispered. \"Can\u0027t. See you later maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard another whimper as she stepped out the door into the hallway but kept moving. A third whimper, louder, more drawn out, turned her around and forced her to take one last peek at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she watched, he turned away, head hanging, and curled up on his mattress facing the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forlorn dejection tightened her throat and damn near broke her heart. He had recognized her as his mother and she\u0027d turned away from him, rejected him. And with those looks, he was probably facing a lifetime of people turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething crumbled inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help her, she couldn\u0027t leave him like this. She hurried over to the crib. He turned over at her approach, crawled to the railing, and pulled himself to his feet. His arms went out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, baby,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027m taking you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled him into her arms - heavier than he looked - and grabbed the blanket from the crib, then she retraced her steps to the door. She peeked out. No sound other than the TV. She stepped to the edge of the great room and peered through to the bayfront yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t see Gilda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart twisted in her chest. Oh, God, where was Gilda?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Dawn spotted her at the other end. She\u0027d switched sides to pull weeds over there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby saw the older woman and shrieked, a truly ear-splitting sound this close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak with relief, her heart still thumping, Dawn turned and hurried for the front door. She paused long enough to wrap the baby in the blanket, then she pushed open the storm door and pulled the inner door closed behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran for the O\u0027Donnell house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby loosed another shriek as the chill wind and snowflakes swirled around him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-44.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
