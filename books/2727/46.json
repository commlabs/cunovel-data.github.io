Did Alex make a move on me? I mean, we did kind of hold hands. But it’s not like that’s a move move. I’m not going to tell Reeve that, though. Better he thinks Alex did. “Why? Are you jealous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve makes a “pfft” sound and looks out the window. “Is Lind jealous of our pool time?” he counters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force a swallow. “He doesn’t know about it.” I want to tell Reeve, Please don’t say anything, but I can’t do that. Instead I think fast and say, “Does Rennie?” even though I’m sure of his answer. Because if Rennie even had a clue about us, I’d definitely know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve scrunches up his forehead. “Nah. I haven’t mentioned it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo neither of us has told anyone. Rennie and Alex don’t know. But I’m dreading the moment they do. Because this is happening. The train is on the tracks, and it’s speeding up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve takes his hands off the steering wheel and lets them fall to his lap, where he fidgets for a moment. Then he looks at me, and I can tell he’s about to say something. Or do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whip out my cell, pound out a fake text, and tell him, “I should get home. Maybe I’ll see you this weekend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bites the inside of his cheek and says, “Sure. See you, Cho.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday, on my way out of Milky Morning, I run into PJ. “Hey, stranger!” I say, as he holds the door open for me. He holds his hand up for a high five and says, “See you tonight, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand him my box of muffins to hold while I zip up my puffer. “What’s happening tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ren scored a ton of free booze. We’re going to meet up in the woods by her house. She didn’t tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say. “She didn’t.” Neither did Ash. At Rennie’s command, I’m sure. If that’s how Ren wants to play it, so be it. Two can play at that game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time are you guys meeting up?” I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so cold, though,” I say. “We’ll freeze out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The booze will keep us warm. Besides, where else are we gonna go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky me, my mom and Nadia are off island at a horse show. They won’t be back until tomorrow afternoon. My mom wanted me to stay at Rennie’s or ask Carlota to stay over, which I told her was ridiculous—I’m seventeen, and in less than a year I’ll be away at college. I’m old enough to stay by myself for a night. “Besides,” I said, “don’t you trust me?” My mom caved at that. “Of course I do,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI text Alex first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s so cold out. Wanna come over and watch a movie tonight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9? Bring Derek!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe writes back immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds good! Next is Ash. I know that if I dangle Derek in front of her, she’ll take the bait. She’d blow off Rennie in a second to hang out with Derek. She’s been crushing on him since last year, and they’ve hooked up a few times, but they’re definitely not exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom and Nadia are off island tonight. Wanna come over and watch a movie? The guys are coming—Derek too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! What time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Reeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovie night at my house if you’re interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve takes his sweet time writing back. One word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool. I jump into action. Carlota was here earlier today, so the house is sparkly clean. But we need snacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bake a batch of brownies, not from scratch, from a box, but it’s a fancy brand my mom got from some specialty food store in Boston. It cost eleven dollars, so I figure it must be good. For good measure I throw in a handful of chocolate chips. I grab a not-too-expensive-looking bottle of red wine from the wine cellar, and I set that out too, with some glasses. At the last minute I pop a bag of kettle corn and figure that will be good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I run upstairs to get ready. I change out of my school clothes and put on skinny jeans and an off-the-shoulder creamcolored sweater. I dab some Lillia perfume on behind my ears and in the hollow of my neck. No makeup, though, only cherry ChapStick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m excited inside. Excited thinking about Rennie alone in the woods with her bottles of booze, freezing her butt off while she waits for everybody to show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re all lounging in the TV room. Ash and Derek are cozied up in our leather armchair with a blanket, where I told them to sit. Alex and I are on the sectional. No Reeve. I guess he met up with Rennie after all. I’m trying not to feel disappointed, when the doorbell rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who else is coming?” Alex asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I say, and run for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open it, and there’s Reeve in his puffer vest and sweater. “Hey!” I say. I get up on my tiptoes and give him a hug. He looks taken aback, and I smile at him, sweet as cotton candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lind is here?” he asks me, looking over my shoulder and frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup . . .” Then it dawns on me. He thought it was going to be the two of us. Like maybe a date. Wow. That’s good. That’s really good. I can’t wait to tell Kat and Mary all about it. I link my arm through his and lead him into the house. “Everybody’s in the living room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve follows me down the foyer. “Reeve’s here,” I announce, even though, duh, he’s here; we all have eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What up, Tabatsky,” Derek says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex makes room for him on the couch. When Reeve sits down and starts to put his feet up on the coffee table, Alex says, “Dude, they don’t wear shoes in the house here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down, Lindy,” Reeve says. But he obeys; he takes his shoes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You too,” Ash says to Derek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine,” I say, but I’m relieved Alex said something. I hate to be the one going around telling people to take their shoes off; it’s so awkward. But my mom will seriously kill me if our white furniture gets dirty. It’s like her life’s mission is to buy everything in white and then rise to the challenge of keeping it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does anybody want any wine?” I ask. I feel so grown-up until I realize I don’t even know how to open a wine bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, please!” Ashlin chimes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fumble with the wine opener until Reeve takes it from me and pops it open in like two seconds without saying a word. Then he pours the wine for all of us. “Where’s Ren?” he asks me, setting the bottle back down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fire-with-fire-burn-for-burn-2/page-46.html","bookId":2727,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:21:33 PM"}
