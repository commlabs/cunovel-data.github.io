{"id":10264,"no":93,"title":"CHAPTER 93","content":"“No doubt a slow one,” Tyrion said. “My lord, you were fostered at Riverrun. I’ve heard it said that you grew close to the Tullys.”\u0026nbsp; “You might say so. The girls especially.”\u0026nbsp; “How close?”\u0026nbsp; “I had their maidenhoods. Is that close enough?”\u0026nbsp; The lie-Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie-was delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it. Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied? About her defloration, and the dagger as well? The longer he lived, the more Tyrion realized that nothing was simple and little was true. “Lord Hoster’s daughters do not love me,” he confessed. “I doubt they would listen to any proposal I might make. Yet coming from you, the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears. “\u0026nbsp; “That would depend on the words. If you mean to offer Sansa in return for your brother, waste someone else’s time. Joffrey will never surrender his plaything, and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl.”\u0026nbsp; “I mean to have Arya as well. I have men searching.”\u0026nbsp; “Searching is not finding.”\u0026nbsp; “I’ll keep that in mind, my lord. In any case, it was Lady Lysa I hoped you might sway. For her, I have a sweeter offer.”\u0026nbsp; “Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn, true... but also more fearful, and I understand she hates you.”\u0026nbsp; “She believes she has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she insisted that I’d murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials.” He leaned forward. “If I gave her Jon Arryn’s true killer, she might think more kindly of me.”\u0026nbsp; That made Littlefinger sit up. “True killer? I confess, you make me curious. Who do you propose?”\u0026nbsp; It was Tyrion’s turn to smile. “Gifts I give my friends, freely. Lysa Arryn would need to understand that.”\u0026nbsp; “Is it her friendship you require, or her swords?”\u0026nbsp; “Both.”\u0026nbsp; Littlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard. “Lysa has woes of her own. Clansmen raiding out of the Mountains of the Moon, in greater numbers than ever before... and better armed.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “Distressing,” said Tyrion Lannister, who had armed them. “I could help her with that. A word from me...”\u0026nbsp; “And what would this word cost her?”\u0026nbsp; “I want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king, to swear fealty, and to make war on the Starks and Tullys?” Littlefinger shook his head. “There’s the roach in your pudding, Lannister. Lysa will never send her knights against Riverrun.”\u0026nbsp; “Nor would I ask it. We have no lack of enemies. I’ll use her power to oppose Lord Renly, or Lord Stannis, should he stir from Dragonstone. In return, I will give her justice for Jon Arryn and peace in the Vale. I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East, as his father was before him.” I want to see him fly, a boy’s voice whispered faintly in memory. “And to seal the bargain, I will give her my niece.”\u0026nbsp; He had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in Petyr Baelish’s grey-green eyes. “Myrcella?”\u0026nbsp; “When she comes of age, she can wed little Lord Robert. Until such time, she’ll be Lady Lysa’s ward at the Eyrie.”\u0026nbsp; “And what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy?” When Tyrion shrugged, Littlefinger burst into laughter. “I thought not. You’re a dangerous little man, Lannister. Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa.” Again the sly smile, the mischief in his glance. “If I cared to.”\u0026nbsp; Tyrion nodded, waiting, knowing Littlefinger could never abide a long silence.\u0026nbsp; “So,” Lord Petyr continued after a pause, utterly unabashed, “what’s in your pot for me?”\u0026nbsp; “Harrenhal.”\u0026nbsp; It was interesting to watch his face. Lord Petyr’s father had been the smallest of small lords, his grandfather a landless hedge knight; by birth, he held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers. Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the Seven Kingdoms, its lands broad and rich and fertile, its great castle as formidable as any in the realm... and so large as to dwarf Riverrun, where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by House Tully, only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise his sights to Lord Hoster’s daughter.\u0026nbsp; Littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape, but Tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cat’s eyes. I have him, he knew. “Harrenhal is cursed,” Lord Petyr said after a moment, trying to sound bored.\u0026nbsp; “Then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself. You’ll have no lack of coin. I mean to make you liege lord of the Trident. These river lords have proven they cannot be trusted. Let them do you fealty for their lands.”\u0026nbsp; “Even the Tullys?”\u0026nbsp; “If there are any Tullys left when we are done.”\u0026nbsp; Littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb. He was trying to watch for bees, but the honey was so sweet. “Harrenhal and all its lands and incomes,” he mused. “With a stroke, you’d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm. Not that I’m ungrateful, my lord, but-why?”\u0026nbsp; “You served my sister well in the matter of the succession.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “As did Janos Slynt. On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently bestowed-only to be snatched away when he was no longer of use.”\u0026nbsp; Tyrion laughed. “You have me, my lord. What can I say? I need you to deliver the Lady Lysa. I did not need Janos Slynt.” He gave a crooked shrug. “I’d sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne. What could be plainer?”\u0026nbsp; “What indeed. You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage?”\u0026nbsp; “I have little doubt you’ll be equal to the task.”\u0026nbsp; “I once told Ned Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman, the only thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it.” Littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed into Tyrion’s mismatched eyes. “Give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to Gulltown.”\u0026nbsp; “That will do nicely.”\u0026nbsp; His guest rose. “This has been quite the pleasant morning, Lannister. And profitable... for both of us, I trust.” He bowed, his cape a swirl of yellow as he strode out the door.\u0026nbsp; Two, thought Tyrion.\u0026nbsp; He went up to his bedchamber to await Varys, who would soon be making an appearance. Evenfall, he guessed. Perhaps as late as moonrise, though he hoped not. He hoped to visit Shae tonight. He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed him not an hour later that the powdered man was at his door. “You are a cruel man, to make the Grand Maester squirm so,” the eunuch scolded. “The man cannot abide a secret.”\u0026nbsp; “Is that a crow I hear, calling the raven black? Or would you sooner not hear what I’ve proposed to Doran Martell?”\u0026nbsp; Varys giggled. “Perhaps my little birds have told me.”\u0026nbsp; “Have they, indeed?” He wanted to hear this. “Go on.”\u0026nbsp; “The Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars. Doran Martell has called his banners, but no more. His hatred for House Lannister is well known, and it is commonly thought he will join Lord Renly. You wish to dissuade him.”\u0026nbsp; “All this is obvious,” said Tyrion.\u0026nbsp; “The only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance. The prince is a sentimental man, and he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe.”\u0026nbsp; “My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition... and it happens we have an empty seat on the small council, now that Lord Janos has taken the black.”\u0026nbsp; “A council seat is not to be despised,” Varys admitted, “yet will it be enough to make a proud man forget his sister’s murder?”\u0026nbsp; “Why forget?” Tyrion smiled. “I’ve promised to deliver his sister’s killers, alive or dead, as he prefers. After the war is done, to be sure.”\u0026nbsp; Varys gave him a shrewd look. “My little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried a... certain name... when they came for her.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “Is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it?” In Casterly Rock, it was common knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and her babe. They said he had raped the princess with her son’s blood and brains still on his hands.\u0026nbsp; “This secret is your lord father’s sworn man.”\u0026nbsp; “My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog.”\u0026nbsp; Varys stroked a powdered cheek. “And if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well as the knight who did the deed...”\u0026nbsp; “Robert Baratheon led the rebellion. All commands came from him, in the end.”\u0026nbsp; “Robert was not at King’s Landing.”\u0026nbsp; “Neither was Doran Martell.”\u0026nbsp; “So. Blood for his pride, a chair for his ambition. Gold and land, that goes without saying. A sweet offer... yet sweets can be poisoned. If I were the prince, something more would I require before I should reach for this honeycomb. Some token of good faith, some sure safeguard against betrayal.” Varys smiled his slimiest smile. “Which one will you give him, I wonder?”\u0026nbsp; Tyrion sighed. “You know, don’t you?”\u0026nbsp; “Since you put it that way-yes. Tommen. You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa Arryn both.”\u0026nbsp; “Remind me never to play these guessing games with you again. You cheat. “\u0026nbsp; “Prince Tommen is a good boy.”\u0026nbsp; “If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while he’s still young, he may even grow to be a good man.”\u0026nbsp; “And a good king?”\u0026nbsp; “Joffrey is king.”\u0026nbsp; “And Tommen is heir, should anything ill befall His Grace. Tommen, whose nature is so sweet, and notably... tractable.”\u0026nbsp; “You have a suspicious mind, Varys.”\u0026nbsp; “I shall take that as a tribute, my lord. In any case, Prince Doran will hardly be insensible of the great honor you do him. Very deftly done, I would say... but for one small flaw.”\u0026nbsp; The dwarf laughed. “Named Cersei?”\u0026nbsp; “What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb? Perhaps, for the glory of her House and the safety of the realm, the queen might be persuaded to send away Tommen or Myrcella. But both of them? Surely not.”\u0026nbsp; “What Cersei does not know will never hurt me.”\u0026nbsp; “And if Her Grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe?”\u0026nbsp; “Why,” he said, “then I would know the man who told her to be my certain enemy.” And when Varys giggled, he thought, Three.\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45501.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:32 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:32 AM"}
