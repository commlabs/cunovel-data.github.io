So violent that he often blackouts when they take hold. Shortly after severely beating two men during an episode, the police escort Benson to a Los Angeles hospital for treatment. There, Dr. Roger McPherson, head of the prestigious Neuropsychiatric Research Unit, is convinced he can cure Benson with an experimental procedure that would place electrodes deep in his brainâ€™s pleasure centers, effectively short-circuiting Harry\u0027s seizures with pulses of bliss. The surgery is successful, but while Benson is in recovery, he discovers how to trigger the pulses himself. To make matters worse his violent impulses have only grown, and he soon escapes the hospital with a deadly agenda. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-terminal-man.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:05 AM"}
