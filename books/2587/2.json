How no one would know or care if the same thing happened to me. How unlikely it is that any of the few neighbors remaining in my corner of the Dark City could even recall my name, much less notice if I went missing one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never felt so alone in my life. Sure, I’ve spent the last three years on my own but I’ve always focused on surviving and waiting for Elias. This woman’s done something to me, though. She’s made me recognize a kind of gap inside, and now I don’t know if I’ll ever figure out how to close or fill it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I raise my head and notice a bundle left in the nook between the two chimneys where the woman was sitting. Numbly, I pick it up. It feels wrong to sift through the contents, but that doesn’t stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer few possessions amount to not much more than half-empty cases of colored powders and stains. Makeup that could never come close to hiding her age or the desperation seeped into every line on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trace my fingers through a vermillion red, something about the tone of it calling to me. Then, tentatively, I press my hand against the chimney next to where the woman sat, tracing a red slash across the smoke-blackened bricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigging through the pots, I find a blue that I smudge over the red and then black around the blue. Eyes, lips, hair, chin: Bit by bit I create a portrait of the woman. Not the way she was at the end, crouched in the shadows, but how she looked falling, with her wide smile and the knowledge that her misery was ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlague rats moan in the alley, and from a window below me I hear men laugh and women joke. The air’s thick with the smell of their sweat and need as they find solace together while I hunker in the night drawing the woman. I make her beautiful, make her flying through the air as if gravity would never dare to sully her with its grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a rush. I feel like I’m reclaiming the control the woman stole from me. And when it’s over and I step back I realize that at some point I stopped painting the stranger and started painting myself. But not how I am now, not scarred, with stringy blond hair that tangles in front of my face. How I could have been if I’d never left my sister in the Forest that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman asked me what I wanted in my life if it could be anything. I haven’t given any thought to what I want in a long time, outside of longing for Elias to come back. When we first arrived in the Dark City I’d have said I wanted to go home to my village in the Forest but somewhere along the way I’ve forgotten that. I’ve let the day-to-day existence of life blind me to dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like this city, I used to be something once. I used to be a girl who liked to get out of bed every morning and who understood passion. Yet for the past three years—longer than that, even—I’ve been frozen, incapable of accepting that life around me has shifted without my consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhausted and lost in thought, I push away from the wall and start making my way back to my flat, needing the familiar surroundings to remind me why I’m still here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy I’ve allowed myself to stay stuck waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness of the night settles heavy on my shoulders as I retreat toward the Dark City. I scamper over bridges and wade through the line of people waiting to cross the Palisade wall into the City proper. I feel invisible, everyone around me wrapped up in their own problems, not caring about an anonymous girl with her gaze trained on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scramble past the debris pile of what used to be a wing of the building housing our flat and climb down the fire escape, slipping through the window into the emptiness of my home. Bare walls, scarred floor, dust coating everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing personal except for the quilt twisted at the bottom of the bed, where it landed after I kicked it off this morning. I wrap it around myself, burying my face in the tattered cloth that was once bright. That once held his smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually sleep comes fast and easy. Usually I want nothing more than to be yanked into the featureless dreams, but not tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight I think of the woman. The stars spin outside, chasing dawn across the sky, and sleep never comes. Only the cold emptiness of the flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo other heartbeat to keep me company. No voice to keep away the blackness of night. Nobody to share the length of days with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I realize that I’ve been spending too long trying to forget that I’ve lost the part of myself that used to belong to someone else. That I once held my sister’s hand and sat on my father’s lap and knew my neighbors’ names. I’ve filled that place with an emptiness, and the woman tonight made me see that that hole inside me is from Elias and that I’ve waited for him to come home long enough. He’s gone. And I’m alone. Crouching here in my empty flat, listening to the moaning of the City dying around me, I remember what I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to find my way back home, to my sister and my family and my village in the Forest of Hands and Teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter II\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are only two ways off the island: boat or bridge. The boat docks sit on the southeast side, deep in the protected range of the Dark City. A series of gates and fences blocks the City from the docks, and Recruiters patrol with dogs that can smell infection to ensure that no vessels carry it into the City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few boats remaining after people fled during the Recruiter Rebellion are fiercely guarded, and I know it would be almost impossible for me to book passage on one. Which means that if I’m going to really do this—leave—I’ll have to travel by foot like everyone else who wants to get off the island. And the only bridges in and out are far north in the Neverlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start my journey in the late morning after a sleepless night standing on the roof of my empty building waiting for dawn. I stared at the few remaining lights flickering in the skyscrapers along the bottom edge of the island and tried to find the strength to leave it behind. Elias fought so hard for our flat in the Dark City, scraping together the exorbitant rent just for the promise of safety, and I feel wrong abandoning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if he comes home tomorrow and I’m not here? What if he’s just over the edge of the horizon, dreaming of me, fighting his way back to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I remember that woman. Her falling through the air. If I only had a few days left to live would I spend them like her, huddled on a roof, waiting for a stranger to stumble upon me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the answer is no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I arrive at the Palisade wall it’s early afternoon. No one challenges me as I make my way through the series of gates separating the Dark City from the Neverlands. It’s only those coming the opposite direction—those trying to gain access into the Dark City—they care about. People leave every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey through the Neverlands is uneventful as I stick to the well-traveled avenues, keeping safe in the crush of people scurrying about. Streets of broken buildings spread out around me, dark alleys with sinister promises that I walk past gripping my knife tightly, promising a fight if anyone tries to mess with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s already a line at the bridge when I arrive in the late afternoon, the process of leaving the island a slow and sometimes arduous one. No one meets my eyes. No one glances at me or cares, even when they brush past to shove their way forward, knocking against me as if I’m invisible. It’s easiest when I keep my hair pulled over my face, my head tilted forward as if I’m examining the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy scars make me stand out—they mark me as a distinct individual, and I’ve learned well enough that it’s better to stay inconspicuous, especially since the Rebellion. The Recruiters like to make examples of people, and their methods have grown crueler and harsher day by day. It used to be their cruelty was a form of keeping order, but now with the Protectorate no longer around to hold them in check, it seems more like some sort of sick pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve heard rumors of Recruiters enslaving women who catch their eye and taking anything that isn’t theirs. There have been even worse murmurings: black-market dealings in the dead, people disappearing, heads staked throughout the City as proof of Recruiter power. Things I choose not to contemplate but that have convinced me to avoid causing trouble as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround me people shuffle anxiously. Some of them carry bags and one or two push a cart piled with crates. Those are the ones I try to stay away from—they’ll only attract attention from the Recruiters interested in looting, and there’s no one to stop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main bridge spanning the river between the Neverlands and the mainland is cut into sections by thick metal walls, each with two doors: one for those leaving the island and one for those entering. Running along the center of the bridge is a metal fence separating the coming from the going. A bell rings, the doors slide open and people pool from one lock into the next, and then the doors close and we wait, trapped in a pen until the bell signals again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople push past me, elbows digging into my arms and back. I’m wearing most of the clothes I own: thick trousers under a skirt, three shirts layered over one another and a worn coat hanging down to my thighs. A small pack holding my old quilt rests against my lower back, and I’ve tucked my knife against my hip. I was afraid anything else I packed might be taken. The layers of clothing make my skin slick with sweat as the sun beats down, the day unseasonably warm for winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the next airlock slides open and a man steps in front of me as I start walking through. He knocks me back and just as I catch myself from falling, palms flat against the steel wall, I see her through the metal dividing fence, walking toward the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr rather, I see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd grumbles as I hesitate in the entrance, trying to catch another glimpse of the girl. Eventually someone shoves me hard in the back, but I refuse to budge, bracing my hands against the door. My eyes skim every face, wondering if I was mistaken, but then I see her again just on the other side of the fence, entering the space I’m leaving. Her hair’s long and blond, almost burned white by the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks with her chin tilted up as if she’s never had to worry about anything. As if she has no sense of the danger her clean, healthy looks invite. No one shoves or trips her, she just glides along as if expecting the world to make room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes slide over the crowd, skipping right over me as if I don’t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that’s why I keep my face hidden in my hair. It’s why I hunch my shoulders and wear drab colors. I’m supposed to be invisible. It’s who I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not to her. Never to her. She should be able to find me in the deepest darkness. She should feel me there in the crowd the same way I feel her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s my sister. Her face as familiar to me as my own because it is my own. My chest tightens and I have a hard time gulping enough air. I’m dizzy, gripping the doorframe to steady myself, and the person behind me uses the opportunity to force me through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn against the crowd, trying to wrestle my way back, but they’re insistent and overwhelming. They push forward, flowing through the door in an unending stream as I struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing feels right about this moment. I fight for another look at the girl, knowing I must be mistaken. Even so, a prickle of hope starts to swell inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to scream—to draw attention to myself—but the warning bell rings and the crowd surges forward and then the doors groan shut and the girl I saw is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand frozen, trying to understand what just happened. Trying to breathe. Trying to put the pieces together in my head. Even from such a quick glimpse I could tell that she had my face. My nose. My green eyes. She even had my wrists and chin and ears and neck and hair, if I spent time outside in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had everything but my scars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this makes sense—can’t make sense—but I don’t care because I desperately want it. For years I’ve replayed the moment Elias and I left Abigail, my twin sister, behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth. I see her trip, see the blood trickling down her leg, catching in the downy hairs of her five-year-old shin. I remember the hesitation I felt, the intense desire to keep exploring mingled with rage that my sister was crying and fear that she wouldn’t go on any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember walking away from her. We thought we’d just go a little farther, just around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe never saw her again. We got lost, couldn’t find our way back and ended up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years I’ve dreamed of her a dozen different ways but I’ve only known one truth: that I left my sister crying and terrified in the middle of a path in the Forest because I was being selfish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left my sister once and I can’t do it again. I can’t give up this chance that she’s real and safe and within my grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight my way back to the door, start banging against it, but a Recruiter grabs my hands and twists my wrists painfully, his fingers digging into my skin. “Wrong way,” he says, pushing me back to the crowd waiting at the other end of the holding area, waiting for the bell to sound and the door to open so they can move forward on their journey across the bridge to the mainland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go back,” I tell him, trying to rip my arms free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not the rules.” He narrows his eyes, causing wrinkles to spread around his cheeks. His shirt’s dirty and reeks of smoke and overly ripe perfume. “Unless you have something to trade for it.” He tugs me a little closer until I have to look up at him, my hair falling back from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes in my scars, his lips pressing thin. He drops my wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the bells ring down the bridge, hear the doors sliding open and know that she’s getting farther away from me. “You have to let me go,” I shout at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get to the end and then you can come back. This side is one way only—off the island,” he says. He can’t help but stare at my scars, a look of disgust in his eyes. “Either way, keep moving forward. That’s the rule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the door begin to grind open behind him, the creak of old gears and rusty metal separating me from my sister. He pushes me away from it, away from her. Away from the Neverlands and farther out over the river toward the mainland. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-and-hollow-places-the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-3/page-2.html","bookId":2587,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:39 PM"}
