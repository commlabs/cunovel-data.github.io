These animals were kept in a large pond, and they would come out of the water on seeing their friends and sit down with them to have a good time on the sand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The small dog was very lively on these occasions, and he and the seals would frolic together as though they belonged to the same family, and shared the fruit and cakes from the little girl’s basket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One day, however, just in the midst of their fun, the dog fell into the pond, and, after struggling for a moment in the water, he sank.
