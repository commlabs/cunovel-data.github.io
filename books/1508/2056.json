From searching for a target, locking onto them, and then hunting them down and kill them, this was just like a hunter searching for prey. And the result was also the same as hunting, without any suspense at all. A hunter was a hunter and would rarely be injured by their prey.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNow, the human forces in the Hidden Dragon Galaxy encountered such ‘hunting’ from the saints; they were already in a precarious situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithin the stationed area of this influence, at the central dark palace, in the highest room –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis room was extremely large but the layout was surprisingly simple. There was an octagonal-shaped obsidian table, two heavy and sturdy obsidian chairs, and also a wooden bookshelf nearby. This bookshelf was covered with thick and ancient books, and these ancient books had incredibly archaic languages written on them. Few people would be able to understand the contents of these books. Across the bookshelf was a wide bed with pale gray sheets and beneath the bed was a rug of black velvet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe room’s walls hadn’t been altered much but retrained the original hue and ruggedness of the metal material used to construct them.

Rather, in this dark environment she sat alone, meditating for a while. Then she took out a violet sun crystal and placed it on a small array disc, activating it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn a flash, a vast and beautiful starry sky lit up in front of her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was a star chart for the surrounding 10 billion miles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe truth was that Xiao Moxian had already recorded this star chart in her mind. Every star, every planet, every celestial body including even slightly larger asteroids was imprinted in her mind, and she knew everything there was to know about them. She closed her eyes, reviewing this star chart in her mind. Every day she would come here and spend two hours specifically reviewing this star chart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe knew that she couldn’t remain hidden in this region for much longer; the Good Fortune Saint Son’s search area had been reduced to a tiny region and it was already no longer possible to move. This was because once their base relocated they would definitely leave behind clues and traces of their past presence. At that time, they would be exposed to even greater risks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTime became an increasingly pressing matter. Xiao Moxian couldn’t help but start considering the worst result possible. In her mind she began to envision the countless results that could occur from a battle with the Good Fortune Saint Son…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough it was a battle which she would inevitably lose, Xiao Moxian wouldn’t sit idly by and wait for death to take her.

She couldn’t help but think of Lin Ming once more. A trace of sadness sparkled in her watery eyes.

This nebula and the sun it revolved around began to slowly sink into thick shadows. Xiao Moxian stood up and prepared a pot of clear fog tea for herself. This type of tea was infused with 10,000 year clear fog flowers and it was fragrant and sweet, with the effect of nourishing the soul. It also helped Xiao Moxian maintain her mental state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn fact, she hadn’t rested for a long, long time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe took out two purple crystal cups.

There were many matters that she had to consider. For instance their violet sun crystal reserves were falling precipitously low. In order to maintain the concealing array formations that hid away their base, they needed to consume a tremendous number of violet sun crystals. As their sphere of action constantly shrank it became increasingly hard to mine for these crystals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe needed to figure out a solution to resolve this predicament.
