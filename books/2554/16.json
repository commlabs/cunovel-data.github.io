No dressing necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken peered at the arm, then looked at Jack with concern in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re healing ... quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too quickly. What gives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s obvious, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s obvious in a direction I don\u0027t want it to be moving, so tell me something else. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could, but the answer is clear: As I begin to fail, you are progressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toward what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack knew the answer but needed to hear Glaeken say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toward what I used to be. You are the Heir, after all. And as you well know, upon my death, you assume my old place as Defender.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack did know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken looked at the wound again and heaved a sigh. \"I can only assume this means I haven\u0027t much time left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat saddened Jack. Yeah, he wanted Glaeken to live forever for his own selfish reasons - so he wouldn\u0027t have to take on the Defender mantle. But he had others. He\u0027d grown attached to the old guy. Glaeken had a quiet nobility that appealed to him. He was a walking trove of arcane knowledge. With his passing, humanity would lose someone unique and infinitely valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much do you think? I mean, this is all new to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken smiled. \"It\u0027s new to me as well. I\u0027ve never died before, so I have no idea.\" The smile faded. \"But I\u0027d hoped to outlive Magda. Without me...\" He looked at Jack. \"May I ask you a favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack sensed what was coming. \"Look after her? Sure. Gia and I will see she\u0027s well taken care of. And you know Weezy will pitch in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. That\u0027s a comfort. I want her to stay right where she is. Any change in her surroundings worsens her confusion. If she was moved to another apartment, it would upset her terribly. I don\u0027t want her upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack slipped back into his T-shirt. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I knew I could count on you.\" He turned toward the door, then swung back. \"Oh, and don\u0027t worry about paying for her care. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got plenty of money stashed away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t need it. I\u0027ve left everything to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027everything\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All that I own. You are the Heir, after all, so you will be my heir as well - my sole heir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have any kids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hundreds. But they\u0027re all gone. And Magda and I never had any, so you\u0027re it. You\u0027ll own this building and all my other holdings, including the Foster tract in the Barrens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. Me ... owning a building on CPW -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. I can\u0027t inherit anything. I don\u0027t exist. No Social Security number, no property, never paid taxes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d run into this problem when Gia was pregnant. Without an official existence, he couldn\u0027t be a child\u0027s legal parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken smiled again. \"I\u0027m aware of that. And I\u0027ve been aware of you for a long time. I knew this day would come, so, maybe a dozen years ago I had someone create an alter ego for you. You, as you are now, have a corporeal life but no legal existence. This other entity has a legal existence but no life. He draws a salary from me and pays all proper taxes on it. He has your face and your fingerprints. He is named in my will and you will assume that identity whenever you need to access the assets I will leave to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t need - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few billion dollars? Of course you don\u0027t. No one does. But it\u0027s got to go somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack swallowed. \"Billions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shrugged. \"Give or take. I\u0027m not sure of the exact figure. I\u0027ve had a long time to accrue treasures and property, and they all tend to increase in value over time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillions ... the responsibility was daunting. But then ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all working under the assumption that there\u0027ll be anything to inherit. People who\u0027ve had a peek at the future say it all goes dark sometime in the spring. That\u0027s not far off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken nodded gravely. \"Yes. If Rasalom gets his way, if he succeeds in bringing about the Change, this conversation becomes moot. Ironic in a way. He\u0027s wanted me dead for all these millennia. But now that he has the upper hand, now that he\u0027s so close to succeeding, he wants me to live - so he can rub my nose in the Change before he destroys me. And in a way, I will deserve that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat startled Jack. \"Deserve? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I could have ended the One back in the fifteenth century when I trapped him in the Keep. But I didn\u0027t. I thought our existences were linked, and if I destroyed him, the Ally would have no further use for me, and would destroy me in turn. So I locked him away for what I thought was forever. Well, not forever, just until I tired of the world. I wanted the decision to make my exit to be my own, and to choose the time of that exit. When I was ready I would return to the Keep and end him. But the German Army ruined that plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t have known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Pure selfishness on my part. I\u0027d lived for thousands of years. I could have risked it. So now, if we lose, I deserve whatever happens to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack found the thought intolerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I find him first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But should I die before anything happens, promise me you\u0027ll use some of the inheritance to keep Magda comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Absolutely. Anything and everything she needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clapped Jack on the shoulder. \"Good. Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken headed for the hall and the elevator, leaving Jack alone with the Lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have sensed you undergoing a change for a while,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t moved from her place at the table. Her gaze was serene, her voice low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you do not want it. The realization has caused you only pain. What purpose would telling you serve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood point. He was glad he hadn\u0027t known. He cocked his head toward the door where Glaeken had exited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And him? Any idea how long he\u0027s got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long. His heart is failing - not his will to live on and fight. Those will never fail in that one. But the pump itself is old and it is tired. He will not see midsummer\u0027s eve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the latter half of June.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaken, Jack pulled out a chair and dropped into it. One thing to say he hasn\u0027t got much time left, but to hear it narrowed down like that. Early March now ... that meant ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glaeken\u0027s got less than four months to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady nodded. \"I cannot say the exact day, but the way his light is fading, it cannot last too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack felt his throat constrict. He\u0027d bumped into Glaeken - as Mr. Foster - once as a kid, but had come to know him only last May, not even a year ago. Yet he felt as if he\u0027d known him all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to miss him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to miss him!\" the Lady said. \"He\u0027s been my friend since the First Age. We\u0027ve been the only constants in each other\u0027s lives over these many millennia.\" She pointed at Jack. \"It rests in your hands to see that his few remaining days are not reduced to even fewer by the One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Eliminate Rasalom first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any sense of where he might be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I sense him most often to the east, but he seems ever on the move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the east ... Monroe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where he was conceived ... perhaps. Perhaps farther. Perhaps Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, tonight I\u0027m going to meet with someone who might know the One\u0027s whereabouts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who knows is not likely to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, if he knows, he\u0027ll tell me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-16.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
