He only wished that the midday break would conclude, that the audience would reenter the Auditorium, and the suspense would end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in answer to his unspoken wish, the signal came and the crowd began to move toward the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Jonas\u0027s group had taken a new place in the Auditorium, trading with the new Elevens, so that they sat in the very front, immediately before the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were arranged by their original numbers, the numbers they had been given at birth. The numbers were rarely used after the Naming. But each child knew his number, of course. Sometimes parents used them in irritation at a child\u0027s misbehavior, indicating that mischief made one unworthy of a name. Jonas always chuckled when he heard a parent, exasperated, call sharply to a whining toddler, \"That\u0027s enough, Twenty-three!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was Nineteen. He had been the nineteenth newchild born his year. It had meant that at his Naming, he had been already standing and bright-eyed, soon to walk and talk. It had given him a slight advantage the first year or two, a little more maturity than many of his groupmates who had been born in the later months of that year. But it evened out, as it always did, by Three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Three, the children progressed at much the same level, though by their first number one could always tell who was a few months older than others in his group. Technically, Jonas\u0027s full number was Eleven-nineteen, since there were other Nineteens, of course, in each age group. And today, now that the new Elevens had been advanced this morning, there were two Eleven-nineteens. At the midday break he had exchanged smiles with the new one, a shy female named Harriet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the duplication was only for these few hours. Very soon he would not be an Eleven but a Twelve, and age would no longer matter. He would be an adult, like his parents, though a new one and untrained still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher was Four, and sat now in the row ahead of Jonas. He would receive his Assignment fourth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiona, Eighteen, was on his left; on his other side sat Twenty, a male named Pierre whom Jonas didn\u0027t like much. Pierre was very serious, not much fun, and a worrier and tattletale, too. \"Have you checked the rules, Jonas?\" Pierre was always whispering solemnly. \"I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s within the rules.\" Usually it was some foolish thing that no one cared about—opening his tunic if it was a day with a breeze; taking a brief try on a friend\u0027s bicycle, just to experience the different feel of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial speech at the Ceremony of Twelve was made by the Chief Elder, the leader of the community who was elected every ten years. The speech was much the same each year: recollection of the time of childhood and the period of preparation, the coming responsibilities of adult life, the profound importance of Assignment, the seriousness of training to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Chief Elder moved ahead in her speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the time,\" she began, looking directly at them, \"when we acknowledge differences. You Elevens have spent all your years till now learning to fit in, to standardize your behavior, to curb any impulse that might set you apart from the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But today we honor your differences. They have determined your futures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to describe this year\u0027s group and its variety of personalities, though she singled no one out by name. She mentioned that there was one who had singular skills at caretaking, another who loved newchildren, one with unusual scientific aptitude, and a fourth for whom physical labor was an obvious pleasure. Jonas shifted in his seat, trying to recognize each reference as one of his groupmates. The caretaking skills were no doubt those of Fiona, on his left; he remembered noticing the tenderness with which she had bathed the Old. Probably the one with scientific aptitude was Benjamin, the male who had devised new, important equipment for the Rehabilitation Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard nothing that he recognized as himself, Jonas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the Chief Elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, which had performed the observations so meticulously all year. The Committee of Elders stood and was acknowledged by applause. Jonas noticed Asher yawn slightly, covering his mouth politely with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at last, the Chief Elder called number One to the stage, and the Assignments began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach announcement was lengthy, accompanied by a speech directed at the new Twelve. Jonas tried to pay attention as One, smiling happily, received her Assignment as Fish Hatchery Attendant along with words of praise for her childhood spent doing many volunteer hours there, and her obvious interest in the important process of providing nourishment for the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber One—her name was Madeline—returned, finally, amidst applause, to her seat, wearing the new badge that designated her Fish Hatchery Attendant. Jonas was certainly glad that that Assignment was taken; he wouldn\u0027t have wanted it. But he gave Madeline a smile of congratulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Two, a female named Inger, received her Assignment as Birthmother, Jonas remembered that his mother had called it a job without honor. But he thought that the Committee had chosen well. Inger was a nice girl though somewhat lazy, and her body was strong. She would enjoy the three years of being pampered that would follow her brief training; she would give birth easily and well; and the task of Laborer that would follow would use her strength, keep her healthy, and impose self-discipline. Inger was smiling when she resumed her seat. Birthmother was an important job, if lacking in prestige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas noticed that Asher looked nervous. He kept turning his head and glancing back at Jonas until the group leader had to give him a silent chastisement, a motion to sit still and face forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree, Isaac, was given an Assignment as Instructor of Sixes, which obviously pleased him and was well deserved. Now there were three Assignments gone, none of them ones that Jonas would have liked—not that he could have been a Birthmother, anyway, he realized with amusement. He tried to sort through the list in his mind, the possible Assignments that remained. But there were so many he gave it up; and anyway, now it was Asher\u0027s turn. He paid strict attention as his friend went to the stage and stood self-consciously beside the Chief Elder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of us in the community know and enjoy Asher,\" the Chief Elder began. Asher grinned and scratched one leg with the other foot. The audience chuckled softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the committee began to consider Asher\u0027s Assignment,\" she went on, \"there were some possibilities that were immediately discarded. Some that would clearly not have been right for Asher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For example,\" she said, smiling, \"we did not consider for an instant designating Asher an Instructor of Threes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience howled with laughter. Asher laughed, too, looking sheepish but pleased at the special attention. The Instructors of Threes were in charge of the acquisition of correct language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact,\" the Chief Elder continued, chuckling a little herself, \"we even gave a little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the one who had been Asher\u0027s Instructor of Threes so long ago. At the meeting where Asher was discussed, we retold many of the stories that we all remembered from his days of language acquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially,\" she said, chuckling, \"the difference between snack and smack. Remember, Asher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher nodded ruefully, and the audience laughed aloud. Jonas did, too. He remembered, though he had been only a Three at the time himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punishment used for small children was a regulated system of smacks with the discipline wand: a thin, flexible weapon that stung painfully when it was wielded. The Childcare specialists were trained very carefully in the discipline methods: a quick smack across the hands for a bit of minor misbehavior; three sharper smacks on the bare legs for a second offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Asher, who always talked too fast and mixed up words, even as a toddler. As a Three, eager for his juice and crackers at snacktime, he one day said \"smack\" instead of \"snack\" as he stood waiting in line for the morning treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas remembered it clearly. He could still see little Asher, wiggling with impatience in the line. He remembered the cheerful voice call out, \"I want my smack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Threes, including Jonas, had laughed nervously. \"Snack!\" they corrected. \"You meant snack, Asher!\" But the mistake had been made. And precision of language was one of the most important tasks of small children. Asher had asked for a smack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe discipline wand, in the hand of the Childcare worker, whistled as it came down across Asher\u0027s hands. Asher whimpered, cringed, and corrected himself instantly. \"Snack,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the next morning he had done it again. And again the following week. He couldn\u0027t seem to stop, though for each lapse the discipline wand came again, escalating to a series of painful lashes that left marks on Asher\u0027s legs. Eventually, for a period of time, Asher stopped talking altogether, when he was a Three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while,\" the Chief Elder said, relating the story, \"we had a silent Asher! But he learned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him with a smile. \"When he began to talk again, it was with greater precision. And now his lapses are very few. His corrections and apologies are very prompt. And his good humor is unfailing.\" The audience murmured in agreement. Asher\u0027s cheerful disposition was well-known throughout the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asher.\" She lifted her voice to make the official announcement. \"We have given you the Assignment of Assistant Director of Recreation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clipped on his new badge as he stood beside her, beaming. Then he turned and left the stage as the audience cheered. When he had taken his seat again, the Chief Elder looked down at him and said the words that she had said now four times, and would say to each new Twelve. Somehow she gave it special meaning for each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asher,\" she said, \"thank you for your childhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Assignments continued, and Jonas watched and listened, relieved now by the wonderful Assignment his best friend had been given. But he was more and more apprehensive as his own approached. Now the new Twelves in the row ahead had all received their badges. They were fingering them as they sat, and Jonas knew that each one was thinking about the training that lay ahead. For some—one studious male had been selected as Doctor, a female as Engineer, and another for Law and Justice—it would be years of hard work and study. Others, like Laborers and Birthmothers, would have a much shorter training period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEighteen, Fiona, on his left, was called. Jonas knew she must be nervous, but Fiona was a calm female. She had been sitting quietly, serenely, throughout the Ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the applause, though enthusiastic, seemed serene when Fiona was given the important Assignment of Caretaker of the Old. It was perfect for such a sensitive, gentle girl, and her smile was satisfied and pleased when she took her seat beside him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause ended and the Chief Elder picked up the next folder and looked down to the group to call forward the next new Twelve. He was calm now that his turn had come. He took a deep breath and smoothed his hair with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty,\" he heard her voice say clearly. \"Pierre.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-7.html","bookId":1701,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM"}
