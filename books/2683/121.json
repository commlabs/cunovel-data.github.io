Montecristos,\" she says, standing up, stretching. \"I mean, I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re still as trendy as you used to be.\" She takes a drag off the cigarette, makes a face, stubs it out in an ashtray. \"I really don\u0027t think times have changed that much.\" She starts moving around the suite, not impressed but not unimpressed, just bizarrely neutral, fingering the curtains, studying various knickknacks of mine taking up space on a desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone suddenly rings. When I pick it up no one\u0027s there. I slowly place the phone back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That keeps happening,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie continues to move around the room, runs her hands beneath desktops, inspects a lamp, then another, opens an armoire, gazes at the space behind the TV-Beck on a donkey, a Spice Girl swinging a lasso-then she lifts a remote control and seems on the verge of taking it apart when I interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, why don\u0027t you sit down?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been lounging around all day.\" She stretches again, resumes a more casual pose. \"I can\u0027t stay still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, baby?\" I begin awkwardly. \"How did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey-\" She looks back at me. \"How did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause. \"You go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had my assistant call all the places I thought you\u0027d be staying at.\" She sighs, continues. \"The Connaught, the Stafford, Claridge\u0027s, the Dorchester, the Berkeley, the Halcyon, then-boom-the Four Seasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause, during which I just stare at her, dumbfounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asks. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the f**king Hempel? Why didn\u0027t you check the f**king Hempel? Jesus, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile creeps up but she stops it when she realizes something and this causes her to groan, flopping back into the swivel chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make me put my sunglasses back on, Victor,\" she warns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rings again. I sigh, reach over to the nightstand, pick the phone up, listen. Silence, a series of beeps unevenly spaced, two clicks, a patch of far-off static, another beep, then silence. I look back at Jamie in the swivel chair, playing thoughtfully with her sunglasses, legs dangling over an armrest, before I slowly place the phone back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked for Victor Johnson\u0027s room but then I remembered-or read somewhere-that you changed your name. To Victor Ward.\" She pauses, smiles playfully. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Various committees assumed it was a smart PR move to jump-start my career.\" I shrug. \"It made me semi-famous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A misconception made you semi-famous,\" she corrects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve traveled quite well on that misconception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a suit that got you the gig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was also an inordinate amount of sheer cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do I have the feeling your father made you change the name?\" She smiles playfully again. \"Huh? Did Daddy make a request?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t talk about my father-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god, whatever.\" She stands up again, then flops down in the chair again, sighs a number of times. \"Listen, I\u0027m just here to tell you I\u0027m sorry about freaking out and, y\u0027know, have a good time in London and all that and, um, I\u0027ll see you in another eight years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you gonna freak out again?\" I ask, playing it cool, moving across the bed so that I\u0027m closer to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m feeling, um, reformed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause. \"That depends on your definition of good,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the story, baby?\" I sigh mock-wearily. \"What are you doing? Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today was the last day of the shoot,\" she says. \"We finished the interiors last week in Pinewood.\" Pause. \"So I\u0027m basically free, free, free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then I\u0027m glad I caught you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caught me?\" she asks, stiffening, vaguely annoyed. \"Why are you glad you caught me, Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly her cell phone rings. She pulls it out of a Lulu Guinness handbag I hadn\u0027t noticed before and answers it. While staring directly at me, she says, \"Yes?... It\u0027s fine... Right... No, I\u0027m at the Four Seasons... Is that the buzzword for the day?... Let\u0027s see a show of hands... Yes... Sounds delicious... Right... Later.\" She clicks off, stares blankly at me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-121.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
