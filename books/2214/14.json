Lestat set down in writing the images I made known to him, the pain I shared with him. And though I now propose to relive these horrors, to flesh out the tale in my own words, there are points where I cannot improve on his words, and may from time to time freely call them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began suddenly. I awoke to find that Marius had lifted back the gilded cover of the sarcophagus. A torch blazed behind him on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, Amadeo, they\u0027re here. They mean to burn our house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who, Master? And why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snatched me from the shining coffin box, and I rushed after him up the decaying stairs to the first floor of the ruined dwelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore his red cape and hood, and he moved so fast it took all my power to keep up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it Those Who Must Be Kept?\" I asked. He slung his arm around me, and off we went to the rooftop of our own palazzo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, child, it\u0027s a pack of foolish blood drinkers, bent on destroying all the work I\u0027ve done. Bianca is there, at their mercy, and the boys too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered by the roof doors and went down the marble steps. Smoke rose from the lower floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, the boys, they\u0027re screaming!\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca came running to the foot of the stairs far below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius! Marius, they are demons. Use your magic!\" she cried out, her hair streaming from the couch, her garments undone. \"Marius!\" Her wail echoed up the three floors of the palazzo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God, the rooms are everywhere on fire!\" I cried out. \"We must have water to put this out. Master, the paintings!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius dropped down over the railing and appeared, suddenly below, at her side. As I ran to join him, I saw a crowd of black-robed figures close in on him, and to my horror, try to set his clothes afire with the torches they brandished, as they gave forth horrid shrieks and hissed curses from beneath their hoods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom everywhere these demons came. The cries of the mortal apprentices were terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius knocked his assailants away, turning his arm in a great arc, the torches rolling on the marble floor. He closed his cloak about Bianca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They mean to kill us!\" she screamed. \"They mean to burn us, Marius, they\u0027ve slaughtered the boys, and others they\u0027ve taken prisoner!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly more of the black figures came running before the first attackers could climb to their feet. I saw what they were. All had the same white faces and hands as we had; all possessed the magic blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were creatures such as we!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Marius was attacked, only to fling off all of them. The tapestries of the great hall were ignited. Dark odoriferous smoke belched forth from the adjacent rooms. Smoke filled the stairwell above. An infernal flickering light suddenly made the place as bright as day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pitched myself into battle with the demons, finding them amazingly weak. And picking up one of their torches I rushed at them, driving them back, away from me, just as the Master did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blasphemer, heretic!\" came a hiss from one. \"Demon idolater, pagan!\" cursed another. They came on, and I fought them again, setting their robes afire so that they screamed and fled to the safety of the waters of the canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were too many of them. More poured into the hall even as we fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, to my horror, Marius shoved Bianca away from him towards the open front doors of the palazzo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run, darling, run. Get clear of the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavagely he fought those who would follow her, running after her, to bring them down one by one as they tried to stop her, until I saw her vanish through the open doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to make certain she had reached safety. More of them had closed in on me. The flaming tapestries fell from their rods. Statues were overturned and smashed on the marble. I was nearly dragged down by two of the little demons who clutched at my left arm, until I drove my torch into the face of one, and set the other completely alight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the roof, Amadeo, come!\" Marius shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, the paintings, the paintings in the storage rooms!\" I cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget the paintings. It\u0027s too late. Boys, run from here, get out now, save yourselves from the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnocking the attackers back, he shot up the stairwell and called down to me from the uppermost railing. \"Come, Amadeo, fight them off, believe in your strength, child, fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the second floor, I was everywhere surrounded, and no sooner did I set one ablaze than another was on me, and not seeking to burn me they grabbed my arms and my legs. All my limbs were caught by them, until finally the torch was wrenched from my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, leave me, get away!\" I called. I turned, kicking and writhing, and looked up to see him high above, and again surrounded, and this time a hundred torches were plunged into his ballooning red cloak, a hundred fiery brands were beating against his golden hair and his furious white face. It was as a swarm of blazing insects, and so by such numbers and such tactics the swarm rendered him first motionless; and then, with a great loud gust, his entire body went up in flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius!\" I screamed and screamed, unable to take my eyes off him, warring still with my captors, jerking loose my legs only to have them caught again by cold, hurting fingers, shoving with my arms, only to be pinioned once more. \"Marius!\" This cry came out of me with all my worst anguish and terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that nothing I had ever feared could be so unspeakable, so unendurable as the sight of him, high above, at the stone banister, completely engulfed in flame. His long slender form became a black outline but for one second, and it seemed I saw his profile, head thrown back, as his hair exploded and his fingers were like black spiders clawing up out of the fire for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius!\" I cried. All comfort, all goodness, all hope was burning in this black figure which my eyes would not let go, even as it dwindled, and lost all perceptible form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius! My will died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat remained was a remnant of it, and the remnant, as if commanded by a secondary soul made up of magic blood and power, fought mindlessly on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA net was thrown over me, a net of steel mesh so heavy and so fine that I could see nothing suddenly, only feel myself bound up in it, rolled over and over in it, by enemy hands. I was being carried out of the house. I could hear screams all around me. I could hear the running feet of those who carried me, and when the wind howled past us, I knew we had come to the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown into the bowels of a ship I was carried, my ears still full of mortal wails. The apprentices had been taken prisoner with me. I was thrown down among them, their soft frantic bodies heaped on me and beside me, and I, tightly bound in the net, could not even speak to utter words of comfort, and had no words to give them besides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the oars rise and fall, heard the inevitable splash in the water, and the great wooden galley shivered and moved out towards the open sea. It gained speed as if there were no night to fight its passage, and on and on plowed the oarsmen with a force and strength that mortal men could not have commanded, driving the ship south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blasphemer,\" came a whisper near my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys sobbed and prayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop your impious prayers,\" said a cold preternatural voice, \"you servants of the pagan Marius. You will die for your Master\u0027s sins, all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a sinister laughter, rumbling like low thunder over the moist soft sounds of their anguish and suffering. I heard a long, dry cruel laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, I went deep deep inside myself. I lay in the dirt of the Monastery of the Caves, a wraith of myself, tumbled back into safest and most terrible memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God,\" I whispered without moving my lips, \"save them, and I swear to You I shall bury myself alive among the monks forever, I shall give up all pleasures, I shall do nothing hour by hour but praise Your Holy Name. Lord, God, deliver me. Lord, God-.\" But as the madness of panic took over, as I lost all sense of time and place, I called out for Marius. \"Marius, for the love of God, Marius!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone struck me. A leather-clad foot struck my head. Another struck my ribs, and yet another crushed my hand. All around me were these wicked feet, kicking me and bruising me. I went soft. I saw the shocks of the blows as so many colors, and I thought to myself bitterly, ah, what beautiful colors, yes, colors. Then came the increased wails of my brothers. They too must suffer this, and what mental refuge did they have, these fragile young students, each so well loved and so well taught and groomed for the great world, to find themselves now at the mercy of these demons whose purpose was unknown to me, whose purpose lay beyond anything of which I could conceive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do this to us?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To punish you!\" came a gentle whisper. \"To punish you for all your vain and blasphemous deeds, for the worldly and Godless life you\u0027ve lived. What is Hell to this, young one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, so the executioners of the mortal world said a thousand times when they led heretics to the stake. \"What are the fires of Hell to this brief suffering?\" Oh, such self-serving and arrogant lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think so?\" came the whisper. \"Lay a caution on your thoughts, young one, for there are those who can pick your mind barren of all its thoughts. There may be no Hell for you, child, but there will be suffering eternal. Your nights of luxury and lasciviousness are over. The truth awaits you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, I retreated into my deepest mental hiding place. I had no body anymore. I lay in the Monastery, in the earth, unfeeling of my body. I put my mind at work on the tone of the voices near me, such sweet and pitiable voices. I picked out the boys by name and slowly made a count of them. Over half our little company, our splendid cherubic company, was in this abominable prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not hear Riccardo. But then, when our captors had finished their abuse for a while, I did hear Riccardo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe intoned a litany in Latin, in a raw and desperate whisper. \"Blessed be God.\" The others were quick to answer. \"Blessed be His Holy Name.\" And so on it went, the prayers, the voice gradually becoming weak in the silence until Riccardo alone prayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not give the responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet on he went, now that his charges mercifully slept, praying to comfort himself, or perhaps merely for the glory of God. He moved from the litany into the Pater Noster, and from then into the comforting age-old words of the Ave which he said over and over, as if making a rosary, all alone, as he lay imprisoned in the bottom of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke no words to him. I did not even let him know that I was there. I couldn\u0027t save him. I couldn\u0027t comfort him. I couldn\u0027t even explain this terrible fate which had befallen us. I couldn\u0027t above all reveal what I had seen: the Master perishing, the great one gone into the simple and eternal agony of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had slipped into a shock near to despair. I let my mind recover the sight of Marius burning, Marius a living torch, turning and twisting in the fire, his fine fingers reaching heavenward like spiders in the orange flame. Marius was dead; Marius was burned. There had been too many of them for Marius. I knew what he would have said if he had come to me a comforting specter. \"There were simply too many of them, Amadeo, too many. I couldn\u0027t stop them, though I tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped into tormented dreams. The ship bore on through the night, carrying me away from Venice, away from the ruin of all that I believed in, all that I held dear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awoke to the sounds of singing and to the smell of the earth, but it was not Russian earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were no longer at sea. We were imprisoned on land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill bound in the net, I listened to hollow preternatural voices chanting with a villainous gusto the awful hymn, Dies Irae, or Day of Wrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low drum carried on the zesty rhythm as if it were a song for dancing rather than a terrible lament of the Final Days. On and on went the Latin words speaking of the day when all the world would be turned to ashes, when the great trumpets of the Lord would blast to signal the opening of all graves. Death itself and nature would both shudder. All souls would be brought together, no soul able anymore to hide anything from the Lord. Out of His book, every sin would be read aloud. Vengeance would fall upon everyone. Who was there to defend us, but the Judge Himself, Our Majestic Lord? Our only hope was the pity of Our God, the God who had suffered the Cross for us, who would not let His sacrifice be in vain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, beautiful old words, but they issued from an evil mouth, the mouth of one who did not even know their meaning, who tapped at his eager drum as if ready for a feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA night had passed. We were entombed and now being released from our prison, as the dreaded little voice sang on to its spirited little drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the whispers of the older boys, seeking to give the young ones comfort, and the steady voice of Riccardo assuring all of them that surely they would soon discover what these creatures wanted, and perhaps be allowed to go free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly I heard the rustling, impish laughter everywhere. Only I knew how many preternatural monsters lurked about us, as we were brought into a light of a monstrous fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net was torn from me. I rolled over, clutching at the grass. I looked up and saw that we were in a great clearing beneath high and indifferent bright stars. It was the summery air, and great towering green trees surrounded us. But the blast of the raging bonfire distorted everything. The boys, chained together, their clothes torn, their faces scratched and streaked with blood, cried out frantically when they saw me, yet I was snatched away from them and held, a bevy of little hooded demons fastened to both my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help you!\" I cried. It was selfish and terrible. It came from my pride. It made only panic among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Riccardo, as badly beaten as the rest, turn from right to left, trying to quiet them, his hands bound before him, his doublet almost torn off his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his glance to me, and then together we looked around us at the great wreath of dark-dressed figures that enclosed us. Could he see the whiteness of their faces and hands? Did he, on an instinctive level, know what they were?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be quick if you mean to kill us!\" he called out. \"We\u0027ve done nothing. We don\u0027t know who you are or why you\u0027ve taken us. We are innocent, to a one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was touched by his bravery, and I pulled my thoughts together. I must stop shrinking in horror from my last memory of the Master, but imagine him living, and think what he would tell me to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were outnumbered, that was obvious, and I could now detect smiles on the faces of the hooded figures, who though they draped their eyes in shadow, revealed their long twisted mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the leader here?\" I demanded, raising my voice above the level of human power. \"Surely you see these boys are nothing but mortals! Your argument must be with me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long string of surrounding black-robed figures caved in to whispering and murmuring amongst themselves at this. Those clustered about the band of enchained boys tightened their ranks. And as others whom I could scarce see threw more and more wood and pitch onto the great fire, it seemed the enemy prepared for action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo couples placed themselves before the apprentices who seemed not in their wailing and crying to realize what this meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized it at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you must speak with me, reason with me!\" I shouted, straining against those who held me. To my horror, they only laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly drums began again, some one-hundredfold louder than before, as if an entire circle of drummers surrounded us and the hissing, spitting fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took up that steady beat of the Dies Irae hymn, and suddenly the wreath of figures all to a one straightened and locked hands. They began to sing the words in Latin of the terrible day of woe. Each figure began to rock playfully, lifting knees in playful march as a hundred voices spit out the words to the obvious rhythm of a dance. It made an ugly mockery of the piteous words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drums were joined by the shrill squeal of pipes, and the repeated slam of tambourines, and suddenly the entire wreath of dancers, still hand in hand, was moving, bodies swaying side to side from the waist up, heads bobbing, mouths grinning. \"Dee-eees- - -a- - -ray, dee-ees- -eee- - -raw!\" they sang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panicked. But I couldn\u0027t shake loose of my captors. I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first pair of robed beings before the boys had broken out the first of them who was to suffer and tossed his struggling body high in the air. The second pair of figures caught it, and, with great preternatural thrusts, hurled the helpless child in an arc into the great fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith piteous shrieks, the boy fell into the flames and vanished, and the other apprentices, now certain of their fate, went wild with crying and sobbing and screaming, but to no avail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne after another, boys were disentangled from the others and hurled into the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thrashed back and forth, kicking at the ground and at my opponents. Once I broke one arm loose only to have it imprisoned by three other figures with hard pinching fingers. I sobbed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do this, they\u0027re innocent. Don\u0027t kill them. Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how loud I cried out I could hear the dying cries of the boys who burned, Amadeo, save us, whether there were words to the final terror or no. Finally all the living took up this chant. \"Amadeo, save us!\" but their band was not halved and soon only a fourth remained, squirming and struggling, as they were finally heaved up to the unspeakable death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drums played on, with the mocking chink, chink, chink of the tambourines and the whining melody of the horns. The voices made a fearful chorus, each syllable sharpened with venom as the hymn was sung out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much for your cohorts!\" hissed the figure nearest me. \"So you sob for them, do you? When you should have made a meal of them each and every one for the love of God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The love of God!\" I cried. \"How dare you speak of the love of God! You slaughter children!\" I managed to turn and kick at him, wounding him far worse than he expected, but as ever, three more guards took his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally in the lurid blast of the fire, only three white-faced children were left, the very youngest of our household, and none of them made a sound. It was eerie their silence, their little faces wet and quivering, as they were given up, their eyes dull and unbelieving, into the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called their names. At the top of my lungs, I called out: \"In Heaven, my brothers, in Heaven, you go into the arms of God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how could their mortal ears hear over the deafening song of the chanters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I realized Riccardo had not been among them. Riccardo had either escaped or been spared, or been saved for something worse. I knotted my brows in a tight frown to help me lock these thoughts in my mind, lest these preternatural beasts remember Riccardo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was yanked from my thoughts and dragged towards the pyre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you, brave one, little Ganymede of the blasphemers, you, you willful, brazen cherub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I dug in my heels. It was unthinkable. I couldn\u0027t die like this; I couldn\u0027t go into the flames. Frantically I reasoned with myself, \"But you have just seen your brothers die, why not you?\" and yet I couldn\u0027t accept this as possible, no, not me, I was immortal, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you, and fire will make a roast of you as it has of them. Do you smell their flesh roasting? Do you smell their burnt bones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thrown high in the air, high enough by their powerful hands to feel the very breeze catch hold of my hair, and then to peer down into the fire, as its annihilating blast struck my face, my chest, my outstretched arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown, down, down into the heat I went, sprawled out, in the thunder of crackling wood and dancing orange flames. So I die! I thought if I thought anything, but I think that all I knew was panic, and surrender, surrender to what would be unspeakable pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands clutched me, burning wood tumbled and roared beneath me. I was being dragged off the fire. I was being dragged across the ground. Feet stomped on my burning clothes. My burning tunic was ripped off me. I gasped for air. I felt pain all over my body, the dread pain of burnt flesh, and I deliberately rolled my eyes up into my head to seek oblivion. Come, Master, come if there is a paradise for us, come to me. I pictured him, burnt, a black skeleton, but he put out his arms to receive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure stood over me. I lay on the moist Mother Earth, thank God, the smoke still rising from my scorched hands and face and my hair. The figure was big-shouldered, tall, black-haired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted two strong thick-knuckled white hands and drew his hood back off his head, revealing a huge mass of shining black hair. His eyes were large with pearly whites and pupils of jet, and his eyebrows, though very thick, were beautifully arched and curved over his eyes. He was a vampire, as were the others, but he was one of unique beauty and immense presence, looking down at me as though he were more interested in me than himself, though he expected to be the center of all eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny shiver of thanks passed through me, that he seemed by virtue of these eyes and his smooth Cupid\u0027s bow mouth to be possessed of the semblance of human reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you serve God?\" he asked. His voice was cultured and gentle, and his eyes held no mockery. \"Answer me, Will you serve God, for if you will not, you will be thrown back into the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt pain in all my frame. No thought came to me except that the words he spoke were impossible, they made no sense, and I could therefore make no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once, his vicious helpers lifted me again, laughing, and chanting in time with the loud singing of the hymn which had never ceased, \"Into the fire, into the fire!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" the leader cried out. \"I see in him the pure love of our Savior.\" He lifted his hand. The others released their grip, though they held me suspended, my legs and arms spread out, in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are good?\" I whispered desperately to the figure. \"How can this be?\" I wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew nearer. He leant over me. What beauty he possessed! His thick mouth was the perfect Cupid\u0027s bow, as I have said, but only now did I see its rich dark color, natural to it, and the even shadow of beard, shaven away for the last time in mortal life no doubt, that covered all his lower face, giving it the strong mask of a man. His high broad forehead seemed made of pure white bone only by comparison, with full rounded temples and a peaked hairline, from which his dark curls fell back gracefully to make a striking frame for his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was the eyes, yes, as always with me, the eyes that held me, the large oval and shimmering eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Child,\" he whispered. \"Would I suffer such horrors if it were not for God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wept all the more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was no longer afraid. I didn\u0027t care that I was in pain. The pain was red and golden as the flames had been and ran through me as if it were fluid, but though I felt it, it didn\u0027t hurt me, and I didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout protest, I was carried, my eyes closed, into a passage, where the shuffling feet of those who carried me made a soft, crumbling echo against low ceiling and walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet loose to roll over on the ground, I turned my face to it, sad that I lay on a nest of old rags because I couldn\u0027t feel the moist Mother Earth when I needed her, and then this too was of no import whatsoever, and I laid my cheek on the soiled linen and drifted, as if I had put there to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy scalded skin was a part from me, and not a part of me. And I let a long sigh come out of me, knowing, though I didn\u0027t form words in my mind, that all my poor boys were safely dead. The fire could not have tortured them for long, no. Its heat was too great, and surely their souls had fled Heavenward like nightingales that had drifted into the smoky blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boys were of the Earth no more and no one could do them harm. All the fine things which Marius had done for them, the teachers, the skills they\u0027d been taught, the lessons they\u0027d learned, their dancing, their laughter, their singing, the works they had painted-all of this was gone, and the souls went Heavenward on soft white wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I have followed? Would God have received the soul of a blood drinker into his golden cloudy Heaven? Would I have left the awful sound of these demons chanting Latin for the realm of angels\u0027 song?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did those near me allow these thoughts in me, for surely they read them from my mind. I could feel the presence of the leader, the black-eyed one, the powerful one. Perhaps I was here with him alone. If he could make sense of this, if he could lend it meaning and thereby contain its monstrousness, then he would be some saint of God. I saw soiled and starving monks in caves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled over on my back, luxuriating in the splashy red and yellow pain that bathed me, and I opened my eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-14.html","bookId":2214,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:56 PM"}
