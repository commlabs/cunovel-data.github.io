Had the Gestapo men done something to arouse suspicion? It was maddening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity Clairet was a few yards away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he fired his pistol at the plane, a lucky shot might hit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the plane banked, turned, and roared away to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter was mortified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick Clairet had evaded him- in front of Walter Goedel, Will Weber, and twenty Gestapo men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he buried his face in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had gone wrong? There could be a dozen reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the drone of the plane\u0027s engines receded, Dieter could hear shouts of indignation in French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Resistance seemed as perplexed as he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis best guess was that Flick, an experienced team leader, had smelled a rat and aborted the jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter Goedel, lying in the dirt beside him, said, \"What are you going to do now?\" Dieter considered briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were four Resistance people here: Michel the leader, still limping from his bullet wound; Helicopter, the British radio operator; a Frenchman Dieter did not recognize, and a young woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should he do with them? His strategy of letting Helicopter run free had been a good one in theory, but it had now led to two humiliating reverses, and he did not have the nerve to continue it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get something out of tonight\u0027s fiasco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to have to revert to traditional methods of interrogation and hope to salvage the operation-and his reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought the mouthpiece of the shortwave radio to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All units, this is Major Franck,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Action, I repeat, action.\" Then he got to his feet and drew his automatic pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe searchlights concealed in the trees blazed into life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four terrorists in the middle of the field were mercilessly lit up, looking suddenly bewildered and vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter called out in French, \"You are surrounded! Raise your hands!\" Beside him, Goedel drew his Luger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four Gestapo men with Dieter aimed their rifles at the legs of the Resistance people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of uncertainty: Would the Resistance open fire? If they did, they would be mowed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith luck, they might be only wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dieter had not had much luck tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if these four were killed, he would be left empty-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter stepped forward, moving into the light, and the four riflemen moved with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty guns are aimed at you,\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not draw your weapons.\" One of them started to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw a flash of red hair in the lights: it was Helicopter, stupid boy, heading across the field like a charging bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot him,\" Dieter said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll four riflemen took careful aim and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shots crashed out in the silent meadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelicopter ran another two paces, then fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter looked at the other three, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, they raised their hands in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter spoke into the shortwave radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All teams in the pasture, move in and secure the prisoners.\" He put away his pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to where Helicopter lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo riflemen had shot at his legs, but it was hard to hit a moving target in the dark, and one of them had aimed too high, putting a bullet through his neck, severing his spinal cord, or his jugular vein, or both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter knelt beside him and felt for a pulse, but there was none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t the cleverest agent I\u0027ve ever met, but you were a brave boy,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God rest your soul.\" He closed the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over the other three as they were disarmed and fettered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel would resist interrogation well: Dieter had seen him in action, and he had courage. His weakness was probably vanity. He was handsome, and a womanizer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way to torture him would be in front of a mirror: break his nose, knock out his teeth, scar his cheeks, make him understand that with every minute that he continued to resist, he was getting irreversibly uglier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man had the air of a professional, perhaps a lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Gestapo man searched him and showed Dieter a pass that permitted Dr. Claude Bouler to be out after curfew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter assumed it was a forgery, but when they searched the Resistance cars they found a genuine doctor\u0027s bag, full of instruments and drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder arrest he looked pale but composed: he, too, would be a difficult subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was the most promising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about nineteen, and pretty, with long dark hair and big eyes, but she had a vacant look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer papers showed that she was Gilberte Duval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter knew from his interrogation of Gaston that Gilberte was the lover of Michel and the rival of Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHandled correctly, she might prove easy to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe German vehicles were brought from the barn at La Maison Grandin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prisoners went in a truck with the Gestapo men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter gave orders that they should be kept in separate cells and prevented from communicating with one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Goedel were driven back to Sainte-Cecile in Weber\u0027s Mercedes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a damned farce,\" Weber said scornfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A complete waste of time and manpower.\" \"Not quite,\" said Dieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have taken four subversive agents out of circulation-which is, after all, what the Gestapo is supposed to do-and, even better, three of them are still alive for interrogation.\" Goedel said, \"What do you hope to get from them?\" \"The dead man, Helicopter, was a wireless operator,\" Dieter explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a copy of his code book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, he did not have his set with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we can find the set, we can impersonate Helicopter.\" \"Surely you can use any radio transmitter, so long as you know the frequency assigned to him?\" Dieter shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every transmitter sounds different to the experienced ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd these little suitcase radios are particularly distinctive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll nonessential circuits are omitted, to minimize the size, and the result is poor tone quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we had one exactly like his, captured from another agent, it might be similar enough to take the risk.\" \"We may have one somewhere.\" \"If we do, it will be in Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s easier to find Helicopter\u0027s.\" \"How will you do that?\" \"The girl will tell me where it is.\" For the rest of the journey, Dieter brooded over his interrogation strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could torture the girl in front of the men, but they might resist that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore promising would be to torture the men in front of the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there might be an easier way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plan was forming in his mind when they passed the public library in the center of Reims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had noticed the building before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little jewel, an art deco design in tan stone, standing in a small garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind stopping the car for a moment, please, Major Weber?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeber muttered an order to his driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any tools in the trunk?\" \"I have no idea,\" said Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this about?\" The driver said, \"Of course, Major, we have the regulation tool kit.\" \"Is there a good-sized hammer?\" \"Yes.\" The driver jumped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This won\u0027t take a moment,\" Dieter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver handed him a long-handled hammer with a chunky steel head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter walked past a bust of Andrew Carnegie up to the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was closed and dark, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass doors were protected by an elaborate wrought-iron grille.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked around to the side of the building and found a basement entrance with a plain wood door marked Archives Municipales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter swung at the door with the hammer, hitting the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt broke after four blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went inside, turning on the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran up a narrow staircase to the main floor and crossed the lobby to the fiction section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere he located the letter F for Flaubert and picked out a copy of the book he was looking for, Madame Bovary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not particularly lucky: that was the one book that must be available in every library in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to nine and located the passage he was thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had remembered it accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would serve his purpose very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel was looking amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeber said incredulously, \"You needed something to read?\" \"Sometimes I find it difficult to get to sleep,\" Dieter replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the book from Dieter and read its title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A classic of world literature,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same, I imagine that\u0027s the first time someone broke down the library door to borrow it.\" They drove on to Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they reached the chateau, Dieter\u0027s plan was fully formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ordered Lieutenant Hesse to prepare Michel by stripping him naked and tying him to a chair in the torture chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show him the instrument used for pulling out fingernails,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave it on the table in front of him.\" While that was being done, he got a pen, a bottle of ink, and a pad of letter paper from the offices on the upper floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter Goedel ensconced himself in a corner of the torture chamber to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter studied Michel for a few moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Resistance leader was a tall man, with attractive wrinkles around his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a kind of bad-boy look that women liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was scared but determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thinking grimly about how to hold out as long as possible against torture, Dieter guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter put the pen, ink, and paper on the table next to the fingernail pliers, to show that they were alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Untie his hands,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesse complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel\u0027s face showed enormous relief combined with a fear that this might not be real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter explained to Walter Goedel, \"Before questioning the prisoners, I will take samples of their handwriting.\" \"Their handwriting?\" Dieter nodded, watching Michel, who seemed to have understood the brief exchange in German.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter took Madame Bovary from his pocket, opened it, and put it down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Copy out chapter nine,\" he said to Michel in French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed a harmless request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suspected a trick, Dieter could tell, but he could not see what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Resistance were told to do everything they could to put off the moment when torture began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel was bound to see this as a means of postponement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unlikely to be harmless, but it had to be better than having his fingernails pulled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" he said after a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter watched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis handwriting was large and flamboyant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo pages of the printed book took up six sheets of the letter paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Michel turned the page, Dieter stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told Hans to return Michel to his cell and bring Gilberte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel looked over what Michel had written, and shook his head bemusedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t figure out what you\u0027re up to,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed the sheets back and returned to his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter tore one of the pages very carefully to leave only certain words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilberte came in looking terrified but defiant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I won\u0027t tell you anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will never betray my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, I don\u0027t know anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I do is drive cars.\" Dieter told her to sit down and offered her coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The real thing,\" he said as he handed her a cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrench people could get only ersatz coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sipped it and thanked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter studied her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quite beautiful, with long dark hair and dark eyes, although there was something bovine about her expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a lovely woman, Gilberte,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you are a murderer at heart.\" \"No, I\u0027m not!\" she said gratefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A woman does things for love, doesn\u0027t she?\" She looked at him with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand.\" \"I k ~w all about you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are in love with Michel.\" She bowed her head without replying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A married man, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is regrettable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s why you help the Resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of love, not hate.\" She nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I right?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must answer.\" She whispered, \"Yes.\" \"But you have been misguided, my dear.\" \"I know I\u0027ve done wrong-\" \"You misunderstand me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve been misguided, not just in breaking the law but in loving Michel.\" She looked at him in puzzlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he\u0027s married, but-\" \"I\u0027m afraid he doesn\u0027t really love you.\" \"But he does!\" \"No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loves his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity Clairet, known as Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Englishwoman-not chic, not very beautiful, some years older than you-but he loves her.\" Tears came to her eyes, and she said, \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" \"He writes to her, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagine he gets the couriers to take his messages back to England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sends her love letters, saying how much he misses her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re rather poetic, in an old-fashioned way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve read some.\" \"It\u0027s not possible.\" \"He was carrying one when
