I had to ditch class to be here, Jonesy pulsed and said it was an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a dark look. Should\u0027ve known not to pulse the Jonester. Hell, he always alerts the damn media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, man? It is an emergency! Didn\u0027t Garcia go psycho on everyone\u0027s ass?\" He nodded his head as Mom began to rant about his language. \"Uh-huh, looks like Caleb\u0027s gonna go free. Hey man!\" Jonesy said with a fist-pump, \"this is your get out of jail free card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that old Monopoly game?\" Alex asked, turning bodily with the door still clamped in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorky came forward. \"Put that door down this instant, young man!\" Alex was mainly a follower and looked for a place for it to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Argh!\" she said and waddled over to where he stood. \"Just... ugh! Lean it up against the wall there,\" she said, pointing a stubby finger to the right of the bench that had been beside the plant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, m\u0027am,\" Alex said in a contrite voice as he walked the thing over there and leaned it up against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027m going to have to call a repair place and they\u0027re not going to want to come here and fix this on a Friday!\" She swiveled pretty quickly for a hippo and waddled back to the three pulse screens to rant a pulse to the elusive Repair Team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley put his hands on his hips, dismissing my group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for distraction factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Hart, you have heard your rights as your attorney presented them to you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not been charged with a crime, nor is he in custody,\" Gramps clarified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley looked at him. \"Be that as it may, he needs to be verbally apprised of his rights, Mr. O\u0027Brien.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there another way? What... braille?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as it\u0027s a point of clarity and not issuance,\" Gramps said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley swung his brows up like a clown (I was waiting for the big red nose to grow). \"You needn\u0027t worry, Mr. O\u0027Brien.\" He made serious eye contact with Gramps. \"It is the position of the Kent Police Department to understand Caleb\u0027s stance with this incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn came forward with a smile. \"Hey Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, wondering about his interruption, John was a deliberate dude. I lifted my chin in acknowledgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re wanting you not to sue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t imply that, young man,\" he said eying John, \"not that you\u0027re part of this discussion.\" His eyes gave him away though. Full of worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I do?\" I asked, my eyes narrowing on him like lasers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Garcia will lose his position in the department and there may be longer-term consequences as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis, who had moved to stand behind him added, \"They\u0027re covering their collective butts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grinned and Archer gave him a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley scowled at them and said, \"This does not involve anyone but the people that were placed at the incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was,\" Jade said, raising the hand that I wasn\u0027t holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" Brett said, stepping forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowie got the troll face going but had to be part of the noose that had potential to hang me so he piped in with, \"And me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley returned his gaze to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see Garcia, it\u0027s between him and me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have a police escort. Then I want an answer,\" he demanded and I felt my blood begin to boil. Not so hard as it had been on simmer since the fun of the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps put his calloused hands on his pressed old guy pants. \"Stop commanding and start going along with things, Mr. Riley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley stared at Gramps and neither blinked. Finally, Riley slid his gaze from Gramps\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, I\u0027ll take ya,\" Daniels the cop said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, looking once at Jade as I walked away, our fingers slipping away from their hold reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked into an office that I recognized as Garcia\u0027s. I immediately noticed how the thing had been stripped bare. Gale\u0027s presence had been sanitized from the room down to the minutest detail. No plant, no photo, no single memento that would have signaled her presence remained. When my eyes went to the desk where Garcia sat, his head was in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garcia,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, Caleb,\" he said, \"just go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there for a minute then looked at Henry. \"Can ya give us a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Garcia then nodded. \"I\u0027ll be right outside this door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until he was outside, the door open a crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence rolled out. Finally, his head rose, chin first, the eyes swollen and red and I knew he\u0027d shed some tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved her, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me and I made a stab in the dark, \"Who... Gale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Bobbi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWTF, so? He beat on me because of Gale? He saw my confusion and pondered how to elaborate. He stood, walking over to the window, the dirty glass looking out over the parking lot. The sardines in neat rows. He didn\u0027t turn, his back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood for such a long time I didn\u0027t know if he would ever speak. When he did he startled me and I jumped. \"First, it was Smith.\" He leaned his head against the wood molding that lined the edges of the window. \"I thought we had something special, then she broke it off, turning to that psycho Null.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t know he was a murderer, Garcia. She\u0027s AFTD, not Empath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" he said, suddenly spinning around to face me and I fought to not back up, my mind conjuring up the image of that baton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have seen my tight expression because he sighed and stuffed his hands in the pockets of his dark blue uniform pants. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you...\" he smacked his hand into his open palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Gale? What were ya doin\u0027 there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he whispered. He straightened, then said, \"I want to show you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell hell, that came out of nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" he said, carefully rolling up his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI approached him warily. But when I saw what was revealed on his forearm, it made every ounce of caution flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I wouldn\u0027t strike a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore today, I would\u0027ve staked my life on it. His behavior had been so erratic. It hadn\u0027t made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this might explain it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a star-shaped welt on his forearm, angry and swollen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes met and locked. \"I think they\u0027re using me,\" he said quietly, scared I wouldn\u0027t believe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t need to say who.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked out my pulse and thumbed the pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic, vintage mix I thought into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately music from the turn-of-the-century filled the small office and caused Henry to poke his head in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything okay?\" His eyes swept the office and I replied, \"Yeah, it\u0027s cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked for ten minutes about what we thought happened, the music effectively muffling our words. Afterward, I ended the discussion with, \"So, whatever underlying emotional crap that\u0027s floating around... gets magnified?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll ask my dad but I think it\u0027s some kind of enhancer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... don\u0027t ask him. It may put your folks in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what I could do. I knew what this was about. The Graysheets were causing a distraction here locally and making Garcia the scapegoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, I know I\u0027m just a kid to you...\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his palm. \"No, not so much anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and I saw the old Garcia, the measured and cool-as-a-cucumber Garcia, sneak out in that look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, sometimes your plans are a little extreme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, he didn\u0027t know the half of it. \"Yeah, but I think we can make this work if we do it together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him what to do and he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"You decide how to handle things.\" His back was up against the wall. He\u0027d just placed his trust in a guy that wouldn\u0027t turn seventeen for almost a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I wasn\u0027t your typical dude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already knew what to do, knowing that the Graysheets were on the move just solidified my decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t gonna lie though, I was overwhelmed. The probation was not expired, I was living with Gramps, Garcia was a pawn on the chessboard for the Graysheets, Gale and Clyde faced prejudice at every turn and Brett was a complication that got bigger every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell it loomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was Howie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of what I was thinking must have been on my face because Garcia reached out and squeezed my shoulder. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" His eyes searched my face. \"Tell Bobbi I\u0027m sorry too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Nah, you\u0027ll see her later, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, there\u0027d be a surprise guest if I had anything to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready?\" Henry asked, his hand on the doorknob, cranking it open. He wasn\u0027t really asking, it was just time to go, his eyes flicking to Garcia then back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked away without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I entered the lobby of the police station a swarm of guys in coveralls were there, fixing the door frame. A cleaning guy was getting rid of the remnants of the potted plant. It had looked like ass anyway, its absence was an improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy group stood at one end of the station while Porky continued to rant through pulse, her thumbs working at the speed of light, a blur of thumbs stabbing on oversized pulse pads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, she got shit done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley stood awkwardly but separate from the Parents and Gramps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked out there beside Henry, Riley all but ran to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" he asked tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, briefly glancing at Mom, Dad and Gramps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to press charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Mom yelled and Dad frowned. Gramps searched my face, seeing things most wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure that\u0027s what you want, Caleb?\" His eyes bored into mine, seeking answers to questions he couldn\u0027t ask in this company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him make his own decisions,\" Riley said, barely able to contain his glee. He shoved a pulse consent underneath my nose and said, \"Thumb your agreement here.\" He indicated where and I pushed my thumb into the perfect position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps gave me a long look, then when his thumb was hovering over the part that said, Guardian Consent, Mom said, \"Pops, no. He can\u0027t be allowed in a position of authority. This could happen to another teenager, person...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps met her eyes. \"Have a little faith in your boy, Peanut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried one last time, \"Maybe he was coerced?\" her eyes pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad shook his head. \"I\u0027m with Mac for once, hun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps grunted at that and Dad smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time to trust Caleb\u0027s reasoning, his logic. Technically, he\u0027s already an adult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom slumped her shoulders in defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps pressed his thumb, the pulse glowed a bright green and the color died away to be replaced with the dull black of the pad again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley snatched the pulse consent against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike we\u0027d leap at him and gang-beat him for it. Jerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cops looked at me. They weren\u0027t sure why I hadn\u0027t sued the department, gotten Garcia\u0027s ass fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so anti-American not to sue. I got it. But I had bigger fish to fry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was gonna find Parker. I thought I had a way to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of the station with my friends following. I put up a finger to Gramps and was surrounded by them in a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like a football huddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met everyone\u0027s eyes one at a time. Finally, I told them the loose plan. I pegged Tiff with a stare. \"I\u0027m going to need your help to get Parker to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okey-dokey. We\u0027ll bring the AFTD shit tonight!\" snap-crackle-pop with the gum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy said, \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him and we broke apart. I looked at everyone. \"This could get real messy. If ya don\u0027t want to...\" I held up my palms and they all nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it gonna be like the dome-world?\" Randi asked, even though she\u0027d been the conjurer of that whole thing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-22.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
