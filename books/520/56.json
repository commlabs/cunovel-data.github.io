{"id":44722,"no":56,"title":"19th August","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My window looks out on the loveliest landscape--ocean-scape, rather--\n\u003cbr\u003e nothing but water and rocks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The summer goes. I spend the morning with Latin and English\n\u003cbr\u003e and algebra and my two stupid girls. I don\u0027t know how Marion is\n\u003cbr\u003e ever going to get into college, or stay in after she gets there. \n\u003cbr\u003e And as for Florence, she is hopeless--but oh! such a little beauty. \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid\n\u003cbr\u003e or not so long as they are pretty? One can\u0027t help thinking, though,\n\u003cbr\u003e how their conversation will bore their husbands, unless they\n\u003cbr\u003e are fortunate enough to obtain stupid husbands. I suppose that\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e quite possible; the world seems to be filled with stupid men;\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve met a number this summer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide\n\u003cbr\u003e is right. I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see\n\u003cbr\u003e my education is already being put to use!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short\n\u003cbr\u003e concise letter; I\u0027m not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow\n\u003cbr\u003e his advice. However, if he gets back in time, he will see me\n\u003cbr\u003e for a few days at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I\n\u003cbr\u003e am very nice and sweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer)\n\u003cbr\u003e be received into favour again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also a letter from Sallie. She wants me to come to their camp\n\u003cbr\u003e for two weeks in September. Must I ask your permission, or haven\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e I yet arrived at the place where I can do as I please? Yes, I am\n\u003cbr\u003e sure I have--I\u0027m a Senior, you know. Having worked all summer,\n\u003cbr\u003e I feel like taking a little healthful recreation; I want to see\n\u003cbr\u003e the Adirondacks; I want to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie\u0027s brother--\n\u003cbr\u003e he\u0027s going to teach me to canoe--and (we come to my chief motive,\n\u003cbr\u003e which is mean) I want Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find\n\u003cbr\u003e me not there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I MUST show him that he can\u0027t dictate to me. No one can dictate\n\u003cbr\u003e to me but you, Daddy--and you can\u0027t always! I\u0027m off for the woods.\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59778.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
