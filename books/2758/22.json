All I know is that I can\u0027t turn the emotions off and I can\u0027t un-see the memories that are in my head now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father tries to call, but I don\u0027t speak with him. Mila answers and turns to me but I look away. I don\u0027t want to hear from him. Fuck him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Tyler tries to call. But I won\u0027t speak with him, either. Mila asks, then she turns away, speaking softly to the doctor. But I don\u0027t give a fuck about that, either. They can say what they want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach clenches at the thought of Mila. I\u0027m causing her pain, too. Because I can\u0027t be the person she needs me to be right now. I can\u0027t drive back to the doctor\u0027s and sit with her while we discuss my feelings. Instead, I\u0027m an asshole. Because that\u0027s who I am. That\u0027s what I do best. There for a while, I tried to pretend that I wasn\u0027t, but my true colors are showing now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a fucking dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing I\u0027ve done so far, though, has caused her to leave. I don\u0027t want to talk, I pace instead of sleep, I drink too fucking much and I even angry-fucked her. She didn\u0027t leave. She just looked at me, so understanding and soft, and said she wanted to help me however she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach clenches. As angry as I am at life, I don\u0027t want to hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to her now, to where she is curled up on the couch reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mila, you really should leave,\" I tell her abruptly. \"I\u0027m not fit company. I think it would be best if you went back to your place while I work through this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me, wounded. And my gut clenches again. I know I have to do this. I\u0027m only going to hurt her in the long run anyway. I might as well do it in one fell swoop. A clean break. She starts to protest, but I interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine to leave me. I\u0027m through the worst of it. You have a life to get back to, a job. Your sister needs you. Please. I need time alone. You can call me tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks uncertain and my heart twinges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, how I hate this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is what I deserve. I don\u0027t deserve someone like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands up, reaching up to touch my face. I close my eyes for just a minute, but then steel my resolve and open them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at her and remove her hand. That hurts her, I can see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s for the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. If that\u0027s what you need,\" she says uncertainly. \"But call me if you need anything. And I\u0027ll come back tonight after I close my shop and check in with my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. I walk away before I stop her from leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear her car pulling out of the drive and I throw my glass of water at the wall. It shatters and I replace it with a bottle of Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what I deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest feels like it is crushing me and I fight to swallow. There is just so much to deal with. I don\u0027t know where to start. So fuck it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the bottle of Xanax from the counter and head to the couch with my whiskey. I drop into a heap and pop the top off the pill bottle, taking several and washing them down with the Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drink the rest of the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and for once, there is nothing there but blackness. I breathe a sigh of relief and I finally sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wake, it is morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that because morning sunlight pours through the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince and sit up, rubbing my temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slept through the night. With no nightmares, no thoughts of my mother. I smile, my lips stretching tightly. Suddenly, it\u0027s clear. I can\u0027t handle the issues on my own. I need my old friend, Jack. And my new friend, Xanax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eX marks the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my phone and glance at it. Three missed calls, three voicemails and twelve texts, all from Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you alright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax, answer your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease answer your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m worried about you, Pax. This isn\u0027t fair. Answer your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pretty much all say the same thing. I punch in one answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry. I\u0027m fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I get a fresh bottle of whiskey from the kitchen, I pop more pills in my mouth, three of them. Then I add two more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn\u0027t long before the blackness comes back. I welcome it with open arms. I sing to it, I croon to it. I cradle it in my arms. I do whatever the fuck I want to do to it because it\u0027s blackness, the darkest of nights, and it doesn\u0027t care. If I am alone in the dark, nothing matters. I can\u0027t hurt anyone but myself and I fucking deserve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and let the darkness cradle me. It can fuck me for all I care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t think straight. I accidentally didn\u0027t charge a customer at the store. So after that, I gave up and turned my sign to Closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit by the window of my store, staring out at the happy people walking down the sidewalk. They don\u0027t know how good they have it. Their lives are so easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to text Pax again, but like the four days prior, there isn\u0027t any answer. I\u0027ve driven out there, pounded on the door, called him, even cussed into his voicemail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly once. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not fine. And no one seems to care but me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve thought about calling the police to have them check on him, but I doubt they would. He\u0027s not doing anything illegal, so what can they do? It\u0027s not illegal to drink yourself into a stupor. And the only thing he has in the house, to my knowledge, is the prescription Xanax. I once again wonder at the wisdom of prescribing that to Pax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I had asked Dr. Tyler about it, he explained that he had prescribed it because Pax isn\u0027t an addict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not addicted to any substance,\" the doctor had said. \"He simply hasn\u0027t formed proper coping mechanisms for stress. If he feels like he can\u0027t cope, I\u0027d rather him take a Xanax during the short term while we\u0027re working on these issues rather than seek out illegal drugs. Plus, you\u0027ll be there with him. Everything will be fine, Mila.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m not there anymore. And things aren\u0027t fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see an image of Jill\u0027s open, dead eyes and shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat could have been Pax. And I\u0027m terrified that if someone doesn\u0027t do something, that will be Pax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith shaking fingers, I pick up the phone and do the only thing I can think of to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI call his father. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-22.html","bookId":2758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM"}
