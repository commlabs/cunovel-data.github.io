It was as if he was looking at fractures in the nature of reality itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quakes subsided. The darkness within the cracks lingered for a few breaths, then faded away, the hairline fractures becoming just ordinary breaks in stone. Wary, Lan knelt down, inspecting them closely. Had he seen what he’d thought? What did it mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChilled, he rose to his feet and continued on his way. It is not men alone who grow tired, he thought. The mother is weakening\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hastened through the Saldaean camp. Of those fighting at the Gap the Saldaeans had the most well-kept camp, run by the stern hands of the officers’ wives. Lan had left most of the Malkieri noncombatants in Fal Dara, and the other forces had come with few others except the warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t the Saldaean way. Though they normally didn’t go into the Blight, the women otherwise marched with their husbands. Each one could fight with knives, and would hold their camp to the death if the need arose. They had been extremely useful here in gathering and distributing supplies and tending the wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTenobia was arguing tactics with Agelmar again. Lan listened as the Shienaran great captain nodded to her demands. She didn’t have a bad grasp of things, but she was too bold. She wanted them to push into the Blight, and take the fight to the Trolloc spawning grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, she noticed Lan. \"Lord Mandragoran\", she said, eyeing him. She was a pretty enough woman, with fire in her eyes and long black hair. \"Your latest sortie was a success?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More Trollocs are dead\", Lan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We fight a glorious battle\", she said with pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost a good friend\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTenobia paused, then looked at his eyes, perhaps searching for emotion in them. Lan didn’t give any. Bulen had died well. \"The men who fight have glory\", Lan said to her, \"but the battle itself is not glory. It simply is. Lord Agelmar, a word\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTenobia stepped aside and Lan drew Agelmar away. The aged general gave Lan a grateful look. Tenobia watched for a moment, then stalked off with two guards following hastily at her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell be off into battle herself at some point if we don’t watch her, Lan thought. Her head is full of songs and stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn’t he just encouraged his men to tell those same stories? No. There was a difference, he could feel a difference. Teaching the men to accept that they might die and to revere the honor of the fallen . . . that was different from singing songs about how wonderful it was to fight on the front lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it took actual fighting to teach the difference. The Light send Tenobia wouldn’t do anything too rash. Lan had seen many a young man with that look in his eyes. The solution then was to work them to exhaustion for a few weeks, drilling them to the point that they thought only of their bed, not of the \"glories\" they would someday find. He doubted that would be appropriate for the Queen herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has been growing more rash ever since Kalyan married Ethenielle\", Lord Agelmar said quietly, joining Lan as they walked the back lines, nodding to passing soldiers. \"I think that he was able to dampen her a featherweight or two, but now—without him or Bashere watching her . . \". He sighed. \"Well, regardless. What is it you wished of me, Dai Shan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We fight well here\", Lan said. \"But I’m worried about how tired the men are. Will we be able to keep holding back the Trollocs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are right; the enemy will force its way through eventually\", Agelmar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do, then?\" Lan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will fight here\", Agelmar said. \"And then, once we cannot hold, we will retreat to buy time\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan stiffened. \"Retreat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgelmar nodded. \"We are here to slow the Trollocs down. We will accomplish that by holding here for a time, then slowly pulling back across Shienar\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not come to Tarwin’s Gap to retreat, Agelmar\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dai Shan, I’m led to believe you came here to die\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was nothing but the truth. \"I will not abandon Malkier to the Shadow a second time, Agelmar. I came to the Gap—the Malkieri followed me here—to show the Dark One that we had not been beaten. To leave after we’ve actually been able to gain a footing . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dai Shan\", Lord Agelmar said in a softer voice as they walked, \"I respect your decision to fight. We all do; your march here alone inspired thousands. That may not have been your purpose, but it is the purpose the Wheel wove for you. The determination of a man set upon justice is a thing not lightly ignored. However, there is a time to put yourself aside and see the greater importance\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan stopped, eyeing the aged general. \"Take care, Lord Agelmar. It almost sounds as if you are calling me selfish\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, Lan\", Agelmar said. \"And you are\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan did not flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came to throw your life away for Malkier. That, in itself, is noble. However, with the Last Battle upon us, it’s also stupid. We need you. Men will die because of your stubbornness\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not ask for them to follow me. Light! I did all that I could to stop them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duty is heavier than a mountain, Dai Shan\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat time, Lan did flinch. How long had it been since someone had been able to do that to him with mere words? He remembered teaching that same concept to a youth out of the Two Rivers. A sheepherder, innocent of the world, fearful of the fate laid out before him by the Pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some men\", Agelmar said, \"are destined to die, and they fear it. Others are destined to live, and to lead, and they find it a burden. If you wished to keep fighting here until the last man fell, you could do it, and they’d die singing the glory of the fight. Or, you could do what we both need to do. Retreat when we’re forced to it, adapt, continuing delaying and stalling the Shadow as long as we can. Until the other armies can send us aid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have an exceptionally mobile force. Each army sent you their finest cavalry. I’ve seen nine thousand Saldaean light horse perform complex maneuvers with precision. We can hurt the Shadow here, but their numbers are proving too great. Greater than I thought they would be. We will hurt more of them as we withdraw. We will find ways to punish them with every step we take backward. Yes, Lan. You made me commanding general of the field. That is my advice to you. It won’t be today, or perhaps for another week, but we will \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-72.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
