{"id":78966,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003eDiana continued her chatter, so Christina assumed she wasn\u0027t supposed to comment on that observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Diana led her up the stairs and into the library. It was a bright, airy room, but that was all Christina noticed when she walked inside. Lyon captured her full attention. He was standing by the windows, his back to her. A surge of anger washed over her. Christina was suddenly infuriated with Lyon\u0027s high-handed manner in taking over her life. She knew she was going to shout at him. The urge was making her throat ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her intention hidden from his sister, even managed a weak smile when she said, \"Lady Diana? May I have a few minutes alone with your brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I really don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a good idea. Aunt Harriett says you can\u0027t be unchaperoned for a single minute. She\u0027d heard the rumors, you see,\" Diana whispered to Christina. \"Still, she\u0027s downstairs now, and if you give me your promise that it will only be for a few minutes, no one will—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana, close the door behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had turned around. He was staring at Christina when he gave the order to his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina held his gaze. She wasn\u0027t going to be intimidated by him. And she certainly wasn\u0027t going to take any time at all to notice how ruggedly handsome he looked today. He was wearing a dark blue riding jacket. The fit made his shoulders look bigger than she\u0027d remembered them to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina suddenly realized he was frowning at her. Why, he was actually angry with her. The observation didn\u0027t sit well. Christina was at first so astonished she could barely speak. How dare he be angry? He was the one causing all the mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you accepted Baron Thorp\u0027s request to accompany you to Westley\u0027s affair, Christina. Is that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you hear that?\" Christina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t raised his voice, but the harshness was there in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lyon, I did agree to the baron\u0027s request. He asked me last week. We\u0027re going to this Westley\u0027s lawn party, whatever in heaven\u0027s name that is, and I don\u0027t particularly care if you\u0027re angry or not. It would be rude of me to cancel his escort now. I did give my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going anywhere unless you\u0027re by my side, Christina,\" Lyon said. He took a deep breath before continuing. \"One does not accompany other men when one is about to be married. It\u0027s becoming obvious to me that you don\u0027t grasp the situation, love. We are getting married Saturday, and I\u0027ll be damned if you\u0027ll have another escort the day before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had tried to hold his temper, but by the time he ended his comments he was shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall not marry you,\" Christina shouted, matching his tone. \"No, we shouldn\u0027t get married. Can\u0027t you see I\u0027m trying to protect you? You don\u0027t know anything about me. You want a princess, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, if you don\u0027t start making sense…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon suddenly moved and had her in his arms before she could take a step back. Christina didn\u0027t try to struggle. \"If you weren\u0027t so stubborn, Lyon, you\u0027d realize I was right. I should find someone else. If Thorp doesn\u0027t agree to my proposal, I could ask someone else, even Splickler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to force himself to take another deep breath. \"Listen carefully, Christina. No one\u0027s going to touch you but me. Splickler\u0027s not going to be able to walk for a month, and I forsee a long voyage coming Thorp\u0027s way. Believe me when I tell you that every man you settle on will meet with a few unpleasant surprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t dare. You\u0027re a Marquess. You can\u0027t just go around frightening people. Why can\u0027t Splickler walk?\" she suddenly asked. \"I remember quite specifically that Rhone shut the door on his nose. You\u0027re exaggerating. You wouldn\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dare you smile at me while you make such obscene remarks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dare to do whatever I want to do, Christina.\" He rubbed his thumb across her mouth. Christina felt like biting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her shoulders sagged in defeat. All the man had to do was touch her, and her rational thoughts went flying out the window. God help her, she could feel the shivers gathering in her stomach now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him kiss her, even opened her mouth for his tongue, then let him coach all the anger out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon didn\u0027t let up on his tender assault until Christina was responding to him with equal ardor. He ended the intimacy only after she\u0027d put her arms around his shoulders and was clinging to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only time you\u0027re honest with me is when you kiss me, Christina. For now, that\u0027s quite enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina rested her head against his chest. \"I will not give my heart to you, Lyon. I will not love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his chin against the top of her head. \"Yes, you will, my sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very sure of yourself,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave yourself to me, Christina. Of course I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud knock on the door interrupted them. \"Lyon, unhand that maiden immediately. Do you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was unnecessary. Aunt Harriett had shouted loud enough for the neighbors to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did she know you were holding me, Lyon? Does she have the sight?\" Christina asked, her voice filled with awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open this door. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sight,\" Christina whispered between Aunt Harriett\u0027s bellows. \"She can see through the door, Lyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon laughed. The booming sound made her ears tingle. \"No, my love. My Aunt Harriett just knows me very well. She assumed I\u0027d be holding you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked disappointed. When Aunt Harriett shouted again, Christina turned to go to the door. \"If you give me one or two promises, I\u0027ll wed you Saturday,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon shook his head. The little innocent still didn\u0027t understand. Promises or not, he was going to marry her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What promises?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina turned and found Lyon standing with his arms folded across his chest, waiting. His manner seemed condescending to her. \"One, you must promise to let me go home when my task is done here. Two, you must promise not to fall in love with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, Christina, you aren\u0027t going anywhere. Marriage is forever. Get that little fact in your head. Two, I don\u0027t have the faintest idea why you wouldn\u0027t want me to love you, but I\u0027ll try to accommodate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d be difficult. I just knew it,\" Christina muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door suddenly opened behind her. \"Well, why didn\u0027t you tell me it wasn\u0027t latched?\" Aunt Harriett demanded. \"Did you get this misunderstanding straightened out, Christina?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have decided to marry Lyon for a little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A long while,\" Lyon muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was as dense as fog. Lyon felt like shaking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now come along with me, Christina, and I\u0027ll show you your room. It\u0027s next to my bedroom,\" she added, with a long, meaningful look in Lyon\u0027s direction. \"There will be no private meetings during the night while I\u0027m about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be there in just a minute,\" Lyon said. \"Christina, answer me one question before you leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall wait right outside this door,\" Aunt Harriett announced before pulling the door closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your question?\" Christina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to change your mind before Saturday? Do I have to keep you guarded inside the townhouse until then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re smiling as though you\u0027d like to do just that,\" Christina announced. \"No, I won\u0027t change my mind. You\u0027re going to be very sorry, Lyon,\" she added in a sympathetic voice. \"I\u0027m not at all what you think I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know exactly what I\u0027m getting,\" Lyon said, trying not to laugh. She was giving him a forlorn look, telling him without words that she felt sorry for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re marrying me because you realize how good it was when we slept together,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an arrogant statement, and he really didn\u0027t think she\u0027d bother to answer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina opened the door, smiled at Aunt Harriett, then turned to give Lyon her full answer. \"The full truth, Lyon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be nice for a change,\" Lyon answered with a drawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In front of your dear Aunt Harriett?\" she qualified, giving the perplexed woman a quick smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Harriett let out a sigh, then pulled the door closed again. Christina could hear her muttering something about not needing her fan what with the door flapping back and forth in her face, but she didn\u0027t understand what the older lady meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me, Christina, with your full truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sudden impatience irritated her. \"Very well. I\u0027m marrying you because of the way you fought the mischief makers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that have to do with marriage?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, will you make sense for once in your life?\" Lyon demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized then she should simply have lied to him again. The truth was often more upsetting, more complex than a simple fabrication. Still, it was a little too late to fashion another lie now. Lyon looked as if he wanted to shout. \"I\u0027m trying to make sense, Lyon. You see, even though the battle wasn\u0027t much to boast about, you did fight like a warrior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s perfectly clear to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina.\" His voice was low, angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going to be an easy man to kill. There, now you have the full truth. Does it satisfy you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon nodded, giving her the impression he understood what she was talking about. He knew in that moment that nothing the woman ever said to him in the future would confuse him. No, he\u0027d just reached his limit. A man could only take so many surprises, he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he tried to concentrate on the new puzzle she\u0027d handed him. \"Are you telling me you\u0027ll try to kill me once we\u0027re wed, but because I can defend myself, you might not be able to accomplish the deed? And that is why you\u0027re marrying me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to shake his head when he\u0027d finished his illogical conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Christina answered. \"How shameful of you to think I\u0027d want to harm you. You\u0027ve a devious mind, Lyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said, clasping his hands behind his back. \"I apologize for jumping to such unsavory conclusions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina looked suspicious. \"Well, I would hope so,\" she muttered. \"I shall accept your apology,\" she added grudgingly. \"You look contrite enough to make me believe you\u0027re sincere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon vowed he wasn\u0027t going to lose his patience. He wasn\u0027t as certain about his mind, however. Christina was making mincemeat out of all his thoughts. God help him, he was going to get a clear answer out of her, no matter how long it took. \"Christina,\" he began, keeping his voice soothing enough to lull an infant, \"since you\u0027ve decided I\u0027m not an easy man to kill—and I do appreciate your faith in me, by the way—do you happen to know who\u0027s going to try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man really needed to learn how to control his temper. Christina had just opened the door again. She smiled at Aunt Harriett, saw the poor woman was about to speak, but shut the door in her face before she could get a word out. She didn\u0027t want the woman to overhear her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father. He\u0027s coming back to England. He\u0027ll try to kill me. I promise to protect you, Lyon, for as long as I\u0027m here. When I go away again, he\u0027ll leave you alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, if he\u0027s going to try to kill you, why do you think to protect me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he\u0027ll have to kill you first. It\u0027s the only way he\u0027ll be able to get to me,\" she reasoned. \"You\u0027re a very possessive man, Lyon. Yes, you are,\" she added when she thought he was about to protest. \"You\u0027ll guard me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon was suddenly feeling extremely pleased but didn\u0027t have the faintest idea why. Had she just given him a compliment? He couldn\u0027t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to make certain. \"Then you trust me,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked astonished. \"Trust a white man? Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina jerked the door open and set about smoothing the bluster out of Aunt Harriett. It was a difficult undertaking, for her mind was still occupied with Lyon\u0027s outrageous conclusion. Trust him? Where in God\u0027s name had he come by that ridiculous notion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about time, young lady. A woman could grow old waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aunt Harriett, I appreciate your patience. And you were so right. A good talk with Lyon has resolved all my worries. Will you show me to my room now? I would like to help the maid unpack my gowns. Do you think there\u0027s enough room here for my aunt when she returns to London next week? The Countess will be displeased when she learns I\u0027ve moved away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer ploy worked. Aunt Harriett immediately lost her puzzled expression. The urge to take charge overrode all other considerations. \"Of course I was right. Now come along with me. Did you know Diana has invited several people over for the afternoon? Quite a number have already arrived. They\u0027re all very anxious to meet you, Christina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door clicked shut on Aunt Harriett\u0027s enthusiastic remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon walked back over to the windows. He saw the gathering in the garden below, then dismissed the guests from his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puzzle was taking shape. Lyon concentrated on the new item he believed to be true. Christina did think her father was going to come back to England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frightened look in her eyes, the way her voice had trembled, told him she was, for once, giving him the truth. She knew far more than she was telling, however. Lyon guessed the only reason she\u0027d admitted that much to him was to put him on his guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trying to protect him. He didn\u0027t know if he should feel insulted or happy. She had taken on his duty. But she was right. He was possessive. Christina belonged to him, and he wasn\u0027t about to let anyone harm her. They\u0027d have to kill him first in order to get to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had she ever come by such conclusions about her father? Lyon remembered how emphatic Sir Reynolds had been when he told him Christina had never even met her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of it made sense, unless Christina\u0027s mother had lived longer than anyone believed and had handed down her fears to her daughter… or possibly left the fears with someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho had raised Christina? It surely wasn\u0027t the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummertons, Lyon thought with a smile. What a little liar she was. Though he should have been furious with her for deceiving him, he was actually amused. He sensed she\u0027d fabricated the story just to placate him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-26.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM"}
