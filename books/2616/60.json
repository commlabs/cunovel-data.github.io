Impassable and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or we can just wait for a miracle,” Sergio offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo other option seemed viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya woke up long before dusk. She came into consciousness abruptly and felt disoriented by her surroundings. Her hand throbbed painfully and she looked toward where it was gripping the doorknob tightly. Slowly, she remembered. Then she heard the voice of her Grandmama whispering softly outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“...and we\u0027re trying to make sure you\u0027re safe, Amal, but they are all around the house and we can\u0027t get through. They hurt Samantha real bad and I think she\u0027s dying...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Amaliya pushed the heavy satin off her and looked around the closet. The sun was pushing through a few cracks in the door, but the narrow beams were high above her. The light illuminated the narrow closet enough that she could see Cian was unconscious. His wounds had not healed at all and she touched his face lightly. He did not stir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“...I can feel his power and I\u0027m afraid. I keep praying that God will see us through, but I don\u0027t know what to do. I tried to speak to the dead, but he fills them. This is much scarier than the movies...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandmama?” Her voice sounded raw and the dark need swelled inside of her. She needed to feed soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amal! Are you okay? We\u0027re here! We came to rescue you, but the dead are outside and they won\u0027t let us escape!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya managed to get to her knees and dared to peek out of the keyhole. Her grandmother\u0027s eye came into view. She was staring right back at Amaliya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six-thirty, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours until sunset. Shit. Not much time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay, Amal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Okay as can be. Cian is still asleep. He\u0027s wounded pretty badly. How did you find us?” She was having trouble wrapping her mind around the reality that her grandmother was actually here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sergio and I went to Austin to save you when you didn\u0027t answer your cellphone. We met with Samantha and her friend, Jeff. He\u0027s a vampire hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Samantha knows a vampire hunter?” Amaliya blinked. “Okay. That\u0027s just weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we went into the apartment and saw the map on the computer. So we came here. We saw some dead people guarding this place so we came in and found you. After we killed the dead people...again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya almost laughed, but she could hear the dread in her grandmother\u0027s voice. “Then what happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a cemetery behind the house. And it looks like they all got up and came to visit. We can\u0027t get out of the house or they attack us and drive us back inside. They hurt Samantha really bad. I think she\u0027s dying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the animosity that lay between them, Amaliya felt a pang of anger and regret. Samantha was a firecracker and annoying as hell, but she loved Cian. If she was here, it was out of love for him and Amaliya could not fault her for that. As these thoughts flitted through her mind, she sighed, feeling guilty for her own involvement with Cian. She ran her fingers over the door slowly and leaned against it wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the sun coming in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it is. But the kitchen hallway is kinda dark. Do you want to come out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. We need to plan before dark comes,” Amaliya hesitated as she considered the weight of her next words. It was hard for her to admit, but it was the truth. “I may be the only thing that can stop him since I have some of his power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Let me get Sergio and Jeff and see if they can help me block out the sunlight so you can come out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya listened to her grandmother\u0027s light footsteps dart away from the closet. She leaned over and kissed Cian\u0027s forehead. He was very cold and she could feel death in him. He was significantly weakened and he would need to feed. But the only people he could feed off of were the people who had come to rescue them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” she whispered. As usual, her luck was bad, and now it had infected the others who were in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut last night she had defeated the gruesome creatures that had come up against her and if she could just figure out how she did it, they would be home free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took some time, but Jeff and Sergio were able to block the windows and cracks in the walls with broken furniture, old curtains and even pulled down paneling off the walls in one room. Finally, they had blocked the sun enough to allow Amaliya to emerge from the closet. She slipped out holding what looked like a satin dress over her head and moved into the area they had prepared for her. She was greeted with hugs and kisses from her family, then they retreated from her as she slunk toward the darkened corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff had to admit she looked nothing like he had expected. He supposed Samantha\u0027s bias against her had painted her into a darker figure than she really was. The face framed by the long black hair was more unique than pretty and her tattoos and piercings didn\u0027t look shocking to him. Just rather Austin. She was wearing dark jeans and boots and a t-shirt that probably belonged to Cian. Sitting down cross-legged, she looked around the room they had barricaded and the four people gathered in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff sat next to Samantha, who had fallen asleep again. Her breath was ragged and she was burning up. Innocente had Samantha\u0027s hand between her gnarled ones. Sergio drew close to his cousin and reached out to touch her pale hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya took Sergio\u0027s hand gratefully. “We need to plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cian looks out of commission for awhile yet,” Jeff said, looking toward the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s badly wounded. Roberto turned on us and stabbed him several times with a silver dagger. He\u0027s not healing,” Amaliya said softly. Her striking blue-gray eyes were glittering in the murkiness of the room. Her voice was distinctly East Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened last night? Tell us,” Sergio urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Amaliya did. She told them all about her battle with the undead monsters The Summoner sent against her and Roberto\u0027s betrayal. She told them about their escape in the morning and how she had briefly seized control of the dead from The Summoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you do that now?” Jeff asked excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t even know how I did it,” Amaliya sighed. “I really have no freaking clue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you can try, right?” Sergio looked at her desperately. “We have to get out of here before nightfall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027ll use your family against you,” Jeff added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnocente looked up fearfully. “I don\u0027t like this vampiro at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None of us do.” Amaliya said in a soft voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try, Amal. Try to send them away,” Sergio urged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff could see the fear in the vampire\u0027s face, but she nodded. Closing her eyes and lowering her head, she fell into silence. Jeff held his breath as he felt the tendrils of her power snaking out of her body. Samantha shivered in her unconscious state and Innocente ran her hands over her own arms as she obviously felt chilled. Sergio drew his hand back and looked very unnerved as cold, feathery touches of her power flowed around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll go see if it\u0027s working,” Sergio said in a hushed tone, and hurried out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff\u0027s hand swept over Samantha\u0027s hair as she slowly stirred. “Is he here?” Her eyes were full of fear and she gripped his arm tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no. Amaliya is trying to send them away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamantha\u0027s gaze flicked toward the vampire in the darkened corner. “How is Cian?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wounded, but alive,” Jeff answered, and smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamantha\u0027s eyes welled with tears and her clammy little hand held on to him tighter. “We have to get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re trying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio ducked back into the room and shook his head. “They\u0027re not moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya opened up her eyes slowly. A sensation like a frozen silk scarf being yanked over his flesh sent chills down Jeff\u0027s back as she withdrew her power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tried, Amal,” her grandmother said in a consoling voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m weak,” Amaliya said. “I need to feed soon to be strong enough to face him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff knew he wasn\u0027t the only one who froze. He swallowed hard and looked toward Sergio and Innocente. They were looking at each other with uneasy expressions. Jeff rubbed his hand lightly over Samantha\u0027s trembling fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feed her,” Samantha whispered through her dry lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” Sergio exclaimed with a double take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s our only hope. To get out. She needs to be strong enough to face him if Cian...if Cian can\u0027t.” Samantha was looking worse and Innocente gently rubbed the girl\u0027s wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can feed just enough to make myself strong. I have that control. Cian taught me,” Amaliya said after an very tense moment of utter quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m game if you\u0027ll give Samantha some of your blood,” Jeff said after careful consideration. He knew vampire blood could suspend Samantha\u0027s life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-60.html","bookId":2616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM"}
