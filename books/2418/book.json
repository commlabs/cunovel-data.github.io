Tres Navarre for his most dangerous case yet. If you think the academic world is deadly dull, you\u0027re half right.... \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eWhen a controversial English professor is found shot to death, Tres Navarre — P.I. and Ph.D. — is the only local academic crazy enough to accept the emergency opening at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Police assure him they already have a suspect, so while they wrap up the open-and-shut case, all Tres has to do is teach three classes, grade on a curve ... and walk in a dead man\u0027s shoes. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt should be an easy assignment — but one thing Tres doesn\u0027t do is easy.
