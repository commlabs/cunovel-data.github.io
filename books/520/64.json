{"id":44730,"no":64,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 4th April","content":"Dear Daddy,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you observe the postmark? Sallie and I are embellishing\n\u003cbr\u003e Lock Willow with our presence during the Easter Vacation. \n\u003cbr\u003e We decided that the best thing we could do with our ten days\n\u003cbr\u003e was to come where it is quiet. Our nerves had got to the point\n\u003cbr\u003e where they wouldn\u0027t stand another meal in Fergussen. Dining in\n\u003cbr\u003e a room with four hundred girls is an ordeal when you are tired. \n\u003cbr\u003e There is so much noise that you can\u0027t hear the girls across the table\n\u003cbr\u003e speak unless they make their hands into a megaphone and shout. \n\u003cbr\u003e That is the truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We are tramping over the hills and reading and writing, and having\n\u003cbr\u003e a nice, restful time. We climbed to the top of `Sky Hill\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e this morning where Master Jervie and I once cooked supper--\n\u003cbr\u003e it doesn\u0027t seem possible that it was nearly two years ago. I could\n\u003cbr\u003e still see the place where the smoke of our fire blackened the rock. \n\u003cbr\u003e It is funny how certain places get connected with certain people,\n\u003cbr\u003e and you never go back without thinking of them. I was quite lonely\n\u003cbr\u003e without him--for two minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What do you think is my latest activity, Daddy? You will begin\n\u003cbr\u003e to believe that I am incorrigible--I am writing a book. I started it\n\u003cbr\u003e three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks. I\u0027ve caught the secret. \n\u003cbr\u003e Master Jervie and that editor man were right; you are most convincing\n\u003cbr\u003e when you write about the things you know. And this time it is about\n\u003cbr\u003e something that I do know--exhaustively. Guess where it\u0027s laid? \n\u003cbr\u003e In the John Grier Home! And it\u0027s good, Daddy, I actually believe\n\u003cbr\u003e it is--just about the tiny little things that happened every day. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m a realist now. I\u0027ve abandoned romanticism; I shall go back to it\n\u003cbr\u003e later though, when my own adventurous future begins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This new book is going to get itself finished--and published! \n\u003cbr\u003e You see if it doesn\u0027t. If you just want a thing hard enough and keep\n\u003cbr\u003e on trying, you do get it in the end. I\u0027ve been trying for four years\n\u003cbr\u003e to get a letter from you--and I haven\u0027t given up hope yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Goodbye, Daddy dear,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e (I like to call you Daddy dear; it\u0027s so alliterative.)\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. I forgot to tell you the farm news, but it\u0027s very distressing. \n\u003cbr\u003e Skip this postscript if you don\u0027t want your sensibilities all\n\u003cbr\u003e wrought up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Poor old Grove is dead. He got so that he couldn\u0027t chew and they\n\u003cbr\u003e had to shoot him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nine chickens were killed by a weasel or a skunk or a rat last week.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of the cows is sick, and we had to have the veterinary surgeon\n\u003cbr\u003e out from Bonnyrigg Four Corners.

But we have an awful suspicion\n\u003cbr\u003e that the poor sick cow got nothing but linseed oil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sentimental Tommy (the tortoise-shell cat) has disappeared;\n\u003cbr\u003e we are afraid he has been caught in a trap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There are lots of troubles in the world!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59786.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
