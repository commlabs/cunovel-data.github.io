Jessie and I pointed our weapons toward the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill stopped dead. \"I have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie waved her .44 toward the sign that read: rest-room. \"Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. His earring waggled, catching the light and throwing speckles of gold across his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the act of putting away our guns, Jessie and I tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lot of that going around,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" Cadotte\u0027s eyes were unfocused behind his glasses. He stared at me as if he couldn\u0027t remember who I was. Then understanding dawned. \"Oh, hi, Leigh. What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind her, Slick. What did you find?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did an Internet search on Weendigo, and I came up with the Legend of the Power Eater.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie and I exchanged glances. \"What\u0027s that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of it. But there\u0027s a book - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie groaned. \"Not another book. Haven\u0027t we been through this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, I looked back and forth between them. Jessie explained. \"Will had a book on raising the wolf god. Sadly, a page was missing. A very important page.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ordered another one,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which the werewolves conveniently intercepted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why this time I\u0027m going to the book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a copy in Madison. I\u0027m leaving now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" Jessie sounded forlorn. I stifled a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should be able to see it first thing in the morning. If there\u0027s anything useful I\u0027ll bring the book back or make a copy.\" His gaze softened. \"I\u0027ll be home by tomorrow afternoon, Jess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Whatever. I\u0027ve got plenty to do here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte wasn\u0027t buying it. He crossed the room and scooped her into his arms. Jessie was a big girl, but he was an even bigger man. He held her as if she were a child. Her usually stern face went all dopey with love. I turned away. But I could still hear every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back before you even miss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoochy sounds followed. I tapped my foot, stared at the ceiling, considered leaving the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around. Jessie was holding out her service revolver. Will stared at it with obvious distaste. \"I don\u0027t like guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like dead boyfriends. I\u0027m silly that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last time, Will, they needed you for the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can take care of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I can\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"For me? Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the gun, holding it between two fingers, as if the thing might go off at any moment. Jessie glanced at me and together we rolled our eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to shoot off his toe,\" I commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh well, he\u0027s got nine more. Just don\u0027t shoot off something I\u0027ll need later. Especially something you\u0027ve got only one of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed. I might be a big, bad werewolf hunter, but bawdy sexual innuendos flustered me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I embarrassed the duchess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave her be, Jess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both staring at me. Jessie\u0027s gaze was contemplative. She saw more than I wanted her to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s was sympathetic. I didn\u0027t like his any better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave you two alone to say good-bye.\" I practically ran outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-moon slid toward the horizon. Soon the sun would come up and I could sleep. Here I was a werewolf hunter living like a vampire. That might even be funny, if I did much laughing anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a minute to observe the clear navy blue sky. Living in Topeka for most of my life, I hadn\u0027t known how brightly stars could shine away from the glare of city lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash at the corner of my vision drew my gaze, and I watched a star flare, then drop. City dwellers rarely caught a glimpse of a falling star. Every time I saw one, I was amazed and humbled. There was so much out there we didn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I...\" My words trailed off into the chill of the autumn night. What did I wish?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I could catch the Weendigo - kill a killer at any cost?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr that I could have back the life I\u0027d lost?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I want death or to start anew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea anymore, and that scared me. Until I\u0027d come to Crow Valley I\u0027d only wanted to kill them, not caring if I died, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly there were people I liked all around me, not friends exactly but no longer strangers, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was sexual attraction, something I hadn\u0027t experienced in years. Lust had made me want to live. At least until I tasted it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe not caring had made me damn near invincible. I took chances no one else dared to. The monsters sensed I\u0027d die before I let them live, which gave me an edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the edge was lost. What if in the middle of a death battle I started remembering Damien and his kiss? Longing for it, for him? I\u0027d sneered at Jessie because of her attachment to Will. Was I any better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t afford to be distracted. So what was I going to do about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a pretty good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Jessie, then Will, stepped out. Her uniform was untucked, her shirt buttoned wrong. His pants were unzipped; his glasses had fingerprints all over them. Talk about a quickie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of her, OK?\" Will asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie snorted. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ignored her, focusing instead on me. \"Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie made an impatient sound. \"Let\u0027s get one thing straight, Duchess. I can take care of myself. I don\u0027t need you or anyone else to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, either. But we can humor Edward. And the boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled at my term for Will and I almost laughed. It was so easy to yank her chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. You can call Mandenauer this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten that we\u0027d been about to call him when Will showed up. I went into the station and sat at Jessie\u0027s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make yourself right at home,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" I picked up her phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward answered his direct line on the second ring. \"Jawohl? Was ist es?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. It wasn\u0027t like him to speak in German. He\u0027d been in this country for longer than I\u0027d been alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d only heard him revert to his native tongue when he was very, very tired, sick, or hurt - which had happened maybe twice since I\u0027d known him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh? Yes. Of course. I was sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething he rarely did. But when he slept, he\u0027d always awoken completely alert and ready to deal with anything at a moment\u0027s notice. Military training did that to a guy, or so he said. His behavior concerned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Elise there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise watched over Edward like a mother hen. Drove him nuts, but she wouldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I am in my room and she is... I don\u0027t know where. Now what do you want at... four a.m.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I filled him in on what he didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you contact someone in the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly, You will have your data by midday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward the efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s one more thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Jessie. She made a whirling motion with her hand. Get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever had an agent named Damien Fitzgerald?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward thought for an instant. \"No. The name is not familiar. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI filled him in on a little bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have changed his name,\" Edward murmured. \"I will send you photos of the rogue agents I am aware of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did Elise need you back there pronto?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over the line. I wondered if he\u0027d hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well? What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise had been working on a cure for lycanthropy. So far she\u0027d come up with zilch. The only reason I could think of for Edward to rush to 7-5 headquarters in remote Montana was that she\u0027d had a breakthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea made me nervous. If Elise found a way to cure them, what would I do with the rest of my life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing is up,\" he said. \"Elise thought she might have discovered something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That remains to be seen.\" He sighed. \"But I do not think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out the breath I hadn\u0027t even known I was holding. \"Will you be back soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You and Jessie can handle things in Crow Valley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am tired, Leigh. I need a rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart started thudding faster and harder with dread. \"You\u0027re sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps. Sick and tired of the blood, the death, the killing. And for what? There are always more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never heard him so down. Usually Edward was the one buoying everyone else\u0027s spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Jessie, frowned. He\u0027d never been like this before he\u0027d met her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make sure there aren\u0027t any more here,\" I promised, and hung up. \"What exactly happened in Miniwa?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolf god, totem. Been there, heard that. I meant to Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze slid away from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"He made a few mistakes. Nothing major. Everything worked out for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMistakes? That didn\u0027t sound like Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of mistakes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got distracted. We got captured.\" She shrugged. \"It happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I knew of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d considered telling Edward I thought Hector might be here. Until he\u0027d answered the phone speaking German. Until he\u0027d gone all Eeyore on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s acting so weird,\" I murmured. \"He didn\u0027t want to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you blame him? The guy\u0027s been hunting werewolves, and Lord knows what else, for sixty years. I\u0027d be ready for a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspected she was right, but I didn\u0027t like it. I decided to keep my suspicions about Hector between myself and Jessie until I was sure I wasn\u0027t seeing things again. Why upset Edward if I didn\u0027t have to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the information from Quantico?\" Jessie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Fitzgerald?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t recognize the name, but he\u0027s sending rogue agent pictures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. There\u0027s not much else we can do until then. I\u0027d better make my rounds. Not that I\u0027ll see anything, but I try to at least pretend to earn my second paycheck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place is awful quiet after the sun goes down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Creepy, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow Valley after sunset was as quiet as the proverbial tomb. No lights in any of the windows. Not even a cat trolling the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire town had a deserted air. As if too many of the citizens had disappeared. We just didn\u0027t know how many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere there were werewolves, people went missing. Which was usually how the Juger-Suchers ended up being called to the scene. Then we made sure the missing were explained. Our favorite excuse was that they\u0027d walked into the woods and never come back out. It happens more than you\u0027d think. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-15.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
