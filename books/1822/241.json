Not now, though. Now, there was a real torrent coming for us. From somewhere not far away, I heard wood splintering, and the ship shuddered. It wouldn’t be long now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you understand, Mr Linton?’ he repeated, enunciating each word, his teeth clenched. I couldn’t escape his penetrating glare. And somehow, I found, I couldn’t deny him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Y-yes, Sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adequate.’ He nodded, turning on his heels and marching towards the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ll be waiting outside,’ he said over his shoulder. ‘Don’t take too long. Your dressing room is sinking.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out onto the deck. Mr Ambrose already awaited me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You took your time,’ he observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It was difficult to get the dress on,’ I said, my voice as lifeless as the rest of me. ‘The buttons are at the back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many things I should have said. Yet that was all I could think of. The buttons are at the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship swayed, and I grabbed the doorframe to steady myself. Mr Ambrose didn’t move an inch, somehow seeming able to sway contrary to the ship’s motion, so he was always standing ramrod straight. He held out his arm to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shall we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down at it. Having dressed up as a man for so long, I had almost forgotten how a gentleman was supposed to behave to a lady, and that he was the former, while I was the latter. To have this resurface now that we were in danger of sinking into bottomless depths forever was the cruellest of mockeries. With shaking hands, I clutched his arm, and we proceeded down the ship, towards the clamouring crowd beside the lifeboats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I heard the ship’s alarm bell ringing high above me. It suddenly, painfully, reminded me of church bells announcing a wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa! As if this was anything like a wedding. At a wedding, everything was white. Tonight, everything was in black. At a wedding, two people were joined for life. Tonight, two people would be divided in death. At a wedding, two people loved each other. He only hated me, didn’t he? He had said it often enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced sideways at Mr Ambrose and saw that he, too, was watching me, his dark eyes burning with cold fire. I remembered his lips skimming over mine, and suddenly it struck me that in this last respect, maybe tonight wasn’t so unlike a wedding after all. My jaw began to quiver, and I could feel moisture at the corner of my eyes, threatening to spill over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t, Mr Linton.’ The voice was Mr Ambrose’s - but it was neither as hard nor as cold as usual. It sounded almost gentle. ‘It’s wet enough as it is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded hurriedly and clenched my teeth. I wouldn’t cry! I would be strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived at the sodden altar of our deadly wedding. The wedding guests didn’t seem too pleased to see us. Particularly, when Mr Ambrose started pushing through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You there!’ one of the men shouted. ‘Stand back and wait your turn, like any of us!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Ambrose shot the man a glare that could have frozen lava and held up our joined hands. ‘I’m not seeking a place for myself, but for this lady here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What the hell is that supposed to mean?’ The man growled, not even bothering to look at me. ‘There are already heaps of women in the boats. All that were on the ship!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Apparently not.’ Mr Ambrose’s voice remained calm and cool, but I when I glanced at the little finger of his left hand, I knew the truth behind the mask. The finger was twitching in prestissimo. ‘As you can see, there is still this young lady left, and…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What, that strumpet?’ the man growled, glancing in disgust at my less than orderly attire. ‘Not a chance she’s getting into the boat with us. It’s time that honest men got a pla-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Ambrose’s fist moved faster than a lightning bolt. The man was thrown backwards, driving people right and left, and slammed into the ship’s railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just to clarify,’ Mr Ambrose said, still as cool as an iceberg. ‘I’ll be staying behind to make sure she gets on board safely.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word was out of my mouth before I knew why or how. The crowd’s eyes snapped to me. Then, from me, they went to Mr Ambrose, and back to me again. Something appeared in their eyes then, some understanding I couldn’t quite reach, and they backed away. Mr Ambrose led me through their midst, though now I had started to struggle. I was finally starting to realize all of what he meant to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No!’ I protested. ‘You can’t stay behind! You can’t! I won’t let you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing, just picked me up and deposited me in the lifeboat as if I weighed nothing at all. I tried to scramble out again, but the hands of other women grabbed me, holding me back. I could feel wetness stream down my face. Were those tears, or was it rain? The storm roared louder and louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Look after her, will you?’ Mr Ambrose asked Lady Timberlake, who was cowering in the boat, right beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will, young Sir! I promise. Such a lovely girl. She looks just like I when I was younger. Why, even her dress looks like one of mine! It’s almost like fate. I promise, nothing will happen to her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ I mumbled, helplessly, not looking at her once. ‘No! Don’t do this!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to reach for Mr Ambrose, but he retreated far away. Other people started to climb into the boat after me. Were they were men or women? I did not know. They could have been elephants, for all I cared. All that mattered was: he wasn’t one of them. He didn’t even try to get a place on the boat. He just stood there, staring at me as if his gaze, connected to mine, was his lifeline. I stared back, knowing that all too soon, that line would no longer hold. In such a moment, another man might have spouted goodbyes, confessions - he said not a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom somewhere far away and unimportant, I heard a shouted command. The boat rose into the air and slowly began to be lowered over the side of the ship. I held Mr Ambrose’s gaze until the very last moment. When he vanished behind the side of the ship, I buried my face in my hands and slumped to the boat’s floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis couldn’t be happening! We were supposed to have won! To have brought back the prize in triumph! This was impossible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a violent jerk, the boat touched down on the roiling sea. Someone shouted commands - a man’s voice. So there were men aboard. But he wasn’t. He wasn’t. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-241.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
