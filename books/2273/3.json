It’s like he looks like someone we once knew, only…different. I wonder if he signed in? I’ll go look. And as for you scaring tourists, have some patience with the kids, huh? It’s no wonder they’re sounding a little gruesome. Have you seen this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the local newspaper, which had been lying next to her computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seen what?” Sarah asked. “I didn’t read the paper today—I left right after I woke up and came here.” She winced. “It’s all that hammering, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, how’s that going?” Caroline asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loudly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was the understatement of the year, Sarah thought. She loved the historic property she had bought after her recent return to town, but it was badly in need of not just refurbishing but reinforcement, as well. The previous owner, Mrs. Douglas, had tried to salvage it before the days of community awareness, when it might have been torn down but she hadn’t had the funds to do all the necessary work. When Mrs. Douglas turned eighty, she had decided she was never going to get to it, so she decided to sell and offered the house to Sarah first, because Mrs. Douglas had been friends with Sarah’s maternal grandmother. Given the house’s history, the price had been amazing, another special deal because she had been so close with Sarah’s grandmother, and also because Sarah’s grandmother’s grandmother had been born a Grant, and the property was known as the Grant House. As far as Sarah knew, her mother’s side of the family had actually come from Savannah, but since the name—whether the connection was real or imaginary—had helped her to acquire the property, she was willing to go with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve wanted to live in that house for as long as I can remember,” Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember, and I always thought you were crazy. Old Mrs. Douglas never did anything with it, and we’ve been watching it crumble all these years,” Caroline said. “Remember when Pete Albright went in that Halloween? How we made up the most horrifying stories and then dared him to go in? Some head of the football team! He came out white as a ghost, saying he’d quit being quarterback before he’d sleep in the place all night. He said he heard ghosts in the walls and could feel them trying to touch him. He was absolutely terrified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course he was. We were just terrible. We told him all those old tales about the woman who sold potions and voodooed people to death. And we told him it was full of corpses—which it had been, of course, since it was a mortuary for years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline wrinkled her nose. She was a petite blonde, cute and winsome, even when she made a face. She’d dated Pete Albright back in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were horrible. But he could be pretty macho, so I kind of think he deserved it. And as for you, well, you’re just crazy for living there. That house is spooky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve slept in the house, and it’s just fine. And I applaud Mrs. Douglas. She couldn’t begin to afford to fix it up, but she kept it from the wrecking ball. I say good for her.” Sarah shrugged. “Although I do wish she’d fixed at least a few things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline smiled. “Hey, you wanted history. Not me—not to live with, anyway. Don’t get me wrong, I like history fine or I wouldn’t be working here,” she was quick to say. Not that she really had much choice. The Heritage House was a private museum, owned and operated by her parents. They had come to St. Augustine the year before she was born, embracing everything about the city and quickly making it their home. They were delighted to boast that St. Augustine was the oldest continually inhabited European-based community in the country, founded by the Spaniards in 1565, long before the English stepped foot in Jamestown and even longer before the Mayflower sailed across the sea. They were history buffs, and they hadn’t started up their business to get rich; they simply loved what they did. Caroline’s father, Harry, wrote history textbooks, and that endeavor, not the museum, was what supported them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me plumbing and electric that work any day. And a roof that doesn’t leak,” Caroline told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear you,” Sarah admitted. “But the house is magnificent. And in a year’s time, I’ll have it all set up as a bed-and-breakfast, and I’ll run a collectibles and antiques business out of it, as well. You’ll see,” Sarah assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline laughed. “We should both live so long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. You’ll get it done. I just don’t envy you the process. I grew up in the middle of constant renovations, remember? Every bad storm that came through, we were in the dark for weeks. No closets—they all had wardrobes back then. No whirlpool tubs.” Caroline frowned. “And I’m not sure you should be staying there alone. It’s too big. With everything that’s going on, I don’t think it’s safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant to show you the paper right away. I get sidetracked too easily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another missing woman. This one a local.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no,” Sarah said, reaching for the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A student from the community college,” Caroline said. “She lived at home, but she went out a couple of night ago with a group of kids for a bonfire on the beach out on Anastasia Island…and didn’t come back. There’s her picture,” Caroline said, tapping the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s horrible,” Sarah said softly. The picture was of a young woman, pretty and blond. It was her high school graduation photo. She had bright eyes full of hope, and long shining hair beneath her cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scary, huh?” Caroline said. “She looks a lot like the girl who disappeared last year, the one who was on vacation from D.C.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That girl disappeared from Jacksonville,” Sarah said. But she stared at the picture. The girls really had been similar in appearance. The big bright eyes, the long blond hair. Serial killers often picked a certain physical type, and if there was a serial killer working somewhere in the area, he had obviously chosen his. Pretty blondes with large eyes. She looked at Caroline, who was still studying the paper. “They don’t know that the other girl ever even came this far. Jacksonville is a big city, and with traffic these days, an hour away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Serial killers don’t have cars?” Caroline asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I know. But look on the bright side. Maybe this girl will turn up,” Sarah said. “Thing is, you can’t obsess, or you’d never leave your house. You just have to be smart and careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline shook her head. “I’m not worried about me. I’m the world’s biggest coward. I wouldn’t live in your spooky old house alone for all the tea in China. I’m worried about you. Nothing scares you, and I think some things should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not true, trust me. I have a healthy respect for being careful. I lock my doors, and I got friendly with my neighbors right off the bat,” Sarah protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline sniffed. “Oh, right. To the left, the pregnant teenager whose husband is in the service. And to the right, the octogenarian. They’ll be a big help in a pinch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brenda Cole isn’t a teenager, she’s twenty-one. And Mr. Healey is not an octogenarian, he’s only in his seventies—and he has a dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A teacup Yorkie!” Caroline said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One vicious teacup Yorkie, I’ll have you know. He barks like a son of a bitch,” Sarah assured her, then laughed. “Which he is, of course. But seriously, I’m okay, honestly. I have a baseball bat, I will have an alarm system, and I can dial 911 faster than a speeding bullet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just be careful,” Caroline warned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Hey, want to have dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t. I have to get home. Gary is at the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he’s going to work all night?” Caroline asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until dark. He’s trying to finish tracing all the pipes today. I have a leak in one wall. So I’m going to head home and call up for pizza delivery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop for a six-pack on the way home, too,” Caroline warned. “Make Gary happy. He’s the best. He’s nice, and he can do anything. Funny how all that works out, huh? Gary was such a shop geek in high school, and now he’s doing great. Pete Albright was a star, and I hear he’s working in a fast food restaurant up in Atlanta. Go figure.” She yawned. “Anyway, I’m meeting Will with Renee and Barry. You should grab Gary and go with us.” When Sarah started to reply, Caroline waved a hand dismissively. “Never mind. I know, the house comes first. Anyway, let’s go get changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will, huh?” Renee Otten and Barry Travis were fellow docents who had struck up a romance, and Will Perkins was Sarah’s second cousin. Their mothers had been close, so he was almost like a brother to her, practically a fraternal twin, since they were both the same age, born a day apart, and shared the same coloring. And lately he and Caroline had become quite the item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be disappointed that you’re not coming. You haven’t been home that long,” Caroline said, turning on the reproach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah laughed. “I’ve been here six months. And Will and I see plenty of each other. In fact, he has threatened to move in once the place is done.” While she had attended Florida State—not all that far away in Tallahassee—for her bachelor’s degree, she had gone to Virginia for grad school, and then taken a job with an Arlington historical research and tour agency. But when Caroline’s parents had needed another docent, especially one with her knowledge of local history and lore, she had decided it was time to come back. Virginia was beautiful, and she would always love it, but nothing could compare to the city in which she had been born and raised. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unhallowed-ground-harrison-investigation-7/page-3.html","bookId":2273,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:47 PM"}
