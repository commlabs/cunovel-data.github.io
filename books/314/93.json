He doesn\u0027t say it like he\u0027s pissed. He just wants her to be quiet.

They are buzzing across the Pacific, keeping pretty low down so that the water skims quickly beneath them. She doesn\u0027t know how fast they\u0027re going, but it looks to be pretty damn fast. She always thought the ocean was supposed to be blue, but in fact it\u0027s the most boring gray color she\u0027s ever seen.
