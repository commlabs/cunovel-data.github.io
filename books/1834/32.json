He kissed away any resistance she might have had, and then he slowly moved down her body, kissing every inch of her stomach, teasing her belly button by gently tickling her with the tip of his tongue, and then he moved lower still between her silky thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensations were consuming. The cl**ax was powerful. She cried out as she clung to him and let his passion devour her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo was such an amazing lover, so giving, so gentle. Then he began to torment her. He brought her to a fevered pitch a second time, but just when she was reaching the explosive brink, he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on, sweetheart. I’ll be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t stop. Don’t . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her. “I’ve got to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he left. She closed her eyes. Her body felt as though it was on fire, yet she was chilled because his heat was gone. She began to tremble, and just as she was reaching for the covers, Theo came back to the bed and covered her body with his. It seemed he’d been gone for an eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, where was I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis restraint and control amazed her. Then she noticed the beads of perspiration on his brow. His eyes were hazy with passion, and his jaw was clenched tight, and she saw then the lengths he had gone to for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands began to stroke the passion within her once again. She fought him this time, trying to hold out until he lost his control, but he was stronger. He wasn’t gentle now. She didn’t want him to be. Consumed with the waves of pleasure still coursing through her body, she held him tight as he roughly parted her thighs, then lifted her h*ps and sank deep inside her warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head dropped down onto her shoulder. He closed his eyes in sweet surrender, and let out a loud, thoroughly arrogant groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGripping her, he forced her to stay still. “I can make this last . . . if you . . . cooperate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled up at him. Lord, he was adorable. Then she moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t . . . Oh, God, honey, slow down just a little . . . ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved again, more forcefully this time, arching up against him to take him deeper inside her. He couldn’t hold back any longer. The need became too great. He pulled back, then thrust deep once again, then again and again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo wanted to tell her how perfect she was, how beautiful, but he couldn’t get the words out. The intensity of the feelings rocketing through his body was too overpowering. She wouldn’t let him slow down. He loved her for that. He buried himself inside her, and with one final thrust and one hell of a shout, he cl**axed while she held him close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt as though he’d just died and been reborn. The orgasm was the most amazing thing he’d ever experienced. He’d never let himself go like this. He’d always held a part of himself back, but with Michelle, that hadn’t been possible. It took long minutes for both of them to recover. He knew he had to be crushing her, but he couldn’t find the strength to move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle couldn’t stop caressing him. She loved the feel of his smooth skin under her fingertips. He was all muscle and strength and yet so very gentle with her. Her fingers trailed down his spine, then slowly moved back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart beat against her chest as though it were pounding to get out. She laughed over the absurdity of the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of her lusty laugh made him smile. Bracing his weight with his arms on either side of her, he lifted his head from the crook of her neck so he could look into her eyes. “What’s so funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loving you is going to be the death of me. I can see the headlines now: ‘Sex kills surgeon.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. “That’s not funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around his neck, leaned up and kissed him. “Yes, it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to stay strong because we’ve got nine hundred ninety-nine more to go, and I can’t let you fall apart before we’re finished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finished doing what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sparkle came into his eyes again, and she began to smile in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Acting out my fantasies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did laugh then. “A thousand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah. At least a thousand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got quite an active imagination. Mr. Buchanan. There are places you can go to get help. They’re called sex therapy clinics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “You were all the therapy I needed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was happy I could help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you, Michelle? Didn’t you ever have fantasies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she admitted. “But mine weren’t as creative. I kept having the same one over and over again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nuzzled the crook of her neck. “Tell me about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s sort of a variation on what just happened,” she said softly. “But in my fantasy . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head again. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I scoop you up and toss you on the bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he laughed. “I outweigh you by about two hundred pounds,” he exaggerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We surgeons develop incredible upper-body strength from cracking ribs and cutting through bones,” she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I’m willing. If you want to pick me up . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped when she shook her head. “I’d blow a disc,” she explained. “I only told you about the fantasy so you’d know . . . ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t always going to be calling the shots.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meaning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my turn to drive you wild.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll see about that.” He kissed her again, hard and fast, then got out of bed and lifted her into his arms. “I’m hot,” he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers threaded through his tousled hair, trying to restore order to the soft strands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that kind of hot, but if you keep that up . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sweaty hot. Let’s take a shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so content and sleepy now, she would have agreed to do anything he suggested. “I’ll scrub your back and you may scrub mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I want to scrub your front, and you can —”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand over his mouth. “I get the picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later they were both squeaky clean. The water had turned cold, but that didn’t squelch their passion. Feeling devilish, she leaned up on tiptoes and whispered her fantasy into his ear. She went into detail, and when she was finished, Theo was amazed he could still stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed him back against the tile, then began to drive him out of his mind with hot, wet kisses as she slowly worked her way down his slick body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have the strength to carry her back to bed. They haphazardly dried each other between ardent kisses. Exhausted from their lovemaking, they fell into bed. Theo rolled onto his back. She propped herself up on one elbow and traced the outline of the tiny scar from his appendectomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she leaned down and gently kissed it. His eyes were closed, but he was smiling. “Do you do that to all your patients?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kiss their scars?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely. I have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yawned. “How come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s part of the oath I took. Kiss it and make it better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the sheet up as she rolled onto her back and closed her eyes. She was falling into a deep sleep when Theo nudged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michelle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I found your best feature.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” she asked in a sleepy whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged the sheet down and put his hand on her breast. If she hadn’t been so tired, she would have asked him to explain why men had such an obsession with breasts, but then she suddenly realized just where his hand was pressed and tears sprang into her eyes. How could she not love this man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had placed his hand over her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle didn’t wake up until ten-fifteen the following morning. She stretched, then rolled over and hugged the pillow Theo had used. She closed her eyes again while she thought about the night they had shared. In the midst of her recollections, the sleep cleared from her mind and the day intruded. It was ten-fifteen, and she was supposed to have met her friends at the clinic at eight. Mary Ann was going to kill her. Was she sitting in her car waiting? No, of course not. She would have driven to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, Michelle was ready to go. Dressed in a pair of khaki shorts and a sleeveless blue blouse, she put on ankle socks and one tennis shoe. She ran down the stairs, then paused in the laundry room to lean against the washer and put the other shoe on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went looking for Theo. She found him in her library, sitting in her leather chair, talking on the phone. Noah was with him. He was perched on the edge of the desk. He smiled when he saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e��Good morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down on the sofa and bent to tie her shoelaces. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Theo hang up the phone, but she was having a little trouble looking directly at him. The memory of what they had done the night before was still acutely vivid in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only awkward because Noah was there, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleep well?” Theo asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but I was supposed to be at the clinic hours ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t get the knot in her shoelace untied and knew it was because she was nervous. Take a breath, she told herself. You’re an adult. Act like one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary Ann —”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is at the clinic. Noah let her and her friend in. They came here looking for you around eight-thirty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally got the knot undone and quickly tied the laces. She didn’t hear Theo coming, but suddenly he was standing in front of her. His left shoelace was untied. Without even thinking about it, she reached over, tied it for him, and stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo wasn’t going to let her ignore him any longer. He nudged her under her chin to get her to look at him, then leaned down and kissed her. He didn’t seem to care that Noah was there. He took his time, and with very little coaxing he got her to cooperate and return the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout making a sound, Noah got up and left the room. Theo hugged Michelle and whispered, “Want to fool around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we did that last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay. We can do it again. Besides, that was just a warm-up.” She tried to wiggle out of his arms. He tightened his hold. “Michelle, you aren’t embarrassed about last night, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze flew to his and she saw how worried he looked. “I’m a physician, Theo. Nothing embarrasses me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she kissed him and gave it all she had. Her tongue touched his, once, then once again, and when she pulled back, she was pleased to see that I-want-to-get-you-naked look was back in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have work to do,” she said as she successfully disengaged herself from his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, you don’t. Mary Ann told me that she and Cindy — I think that was the other woman’s name — would get the files in order much faster if you stay away. I’m supposed to keep you busy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She did not say —”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, she did. She said you’re critical and picky. Those were her words, not mine. Your dad called to tell you John Paul moved your furniture out. He’s going to fix what he can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He couldn’t have carried my desk or my sofa by himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A guy named Artie helped him. So, nothing embarrasses you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” she lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did you look embarrassed when I kissed you good morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe headed for the kitchen with Theo right on her heels. “I was thinking about Noah. I didn’t want him to be embarrassed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo thought that was hilarious. Noah heard the laughter and poked his head around the door. “What’s so funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” Michelle said as she edged past him to get into the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator to look for a Diet Coke and did a double take. The fridge had been pretty bare the night before, but now it was packed with food and drinks. She found a Diet Coke way in the back, grabbed it, and closed the door. Then she opened the door again to make sure she hadn’t imagined it, spotted the sticks of real butter, and guessed who was responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noah doesn’t know how to be embarrassed. Do you?” Theo asked his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Embarrassed about what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sex. You know what sex is, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure I do. I read all about it in a book once. I’m thinking about trying it out one of these days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both having a good old time teasing her. She sat down at the table and only then noticed the triple layer chocolate cake on the counter. Noah grabbed a towel and went to the stove to lift the lid on a large iron kettle. The spicy scent of gumbo immediately filled the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you have time to make this?” Noah asked. “It sure smells good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t remember what her father had told her. Was she supposed to say she baked the cake or made the gumbo? Then Noah asked her if she wanted a slice of home-baked bread. The French loaf was sitting on waxed paper by the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a card with the gumbo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t see one,” Noah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I made it.” She smiled as she told the lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo got the milk out of the refrigerator and put it down on the table. “You were a busy woman last night. Did you bake the cake too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling like an idiot, she asked, “Is there a card with the cake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I guess I made that too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the bread?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No card?” she asked, trying to maintain a straight face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t see one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just love to bake bread in the middle of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo put a box of Frosted Flakes, a box of raisin bran, and a box of Quaker breakfast bars on the table so Michelle would have a choice. Then he got her a spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the lady sneaking in the back door with the bread wasn’t fibbing when she said you baked the bread at her house last night and forgot to bring it home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle had gone way past feeling foolish. Where were all the stupid cards? Had her father decided to change his game plan and forgotten to mention it to her? What was she supposed to say now? If she told Theo the truth, her father would think she wasn’t cooperating with his sacred cause to keep Theo in Bowen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaddy wasn’t going to be able to accuse her of not being a game player. “That’s right,” she said. “Just after you fell asleep, I came downstairs, fixed the gumbo and baked the cake; then I got in the car and drove over to . . .” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mercy-buchanan-renard-2/page-32.html","bookId":1834,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:46 PM"}
