Sheheard Kestrel\u0027s words like a character remembering a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ephrase In a bad movie. Kill them, kill them, kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark laughed In a very strange way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to be really rotten for him, MaryLynnette thought, curiously dispassionate. I mean, if we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere going tolive through this, which we\u0027re not, it would be really rotten for him. He was already afraidof\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirls, and sort of pessimistic about life in general\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we all sit down?\" Rowan said with astifled sigh. \"We\u0027ve got to figure this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark threw back his head and gave another shortbark of a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" he said. \"Let\u0027s all sit down, why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re fast as whippets, Mary-Lynnette thought.If we run now, they\u0027ll catch us. But If we sit, and they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget comfortable, and I distract them-or hitthem with something...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sitl\" she ordered Mark briskly. Rowan and Kestrel moved away from the deer and sat. Jade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estood with her hands on her hips for a moment, then sat,too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting, Mark was still acting punch-drunk. Hewaved the flashlight around. \"You girls aresomethingelse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou girls are really-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re vampires,\" Jade said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Mark laughed quietly to himself. \"Yeah,\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette took the flashlight away from him. She wanted control of it. And it was heavy plastic and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emetal. It was a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while one layer of her mind was thinking:Shine the light in their eyesat just the rightmoment andthen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehit oneof them; another part was thinking:Shemeans they\u0027repeoplewhothinkthey\u0027re vampires;peoplewith\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat weird disease that makes them anemic; and one final part was saying:Youmight as well faceit;they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s world view had been knocked rightout of the ballpark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you justhate that,\" Mark was saying. \"You meet a girl and she seems pretty nice and you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etell all your friends and then before you know it she turnsout to be avampire.Don\u0027t you just hate it when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat happens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. God, he\u0027s hysterical, Mary-Lynnette realized. She grabbed his shoulder and hissed in his ear, \"Get a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrip, now.\",\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see what the point is in talking to them,Rowan,\" Kestrel was saying. \"You know what wehave to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rowan was rubbing her forehead. \"I was thinkingwe might influence them,\" she said in an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eundertone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know why that won\u0027t work.\" Kestrel\u0027s voice was soft and flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Jade said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They followed us for a reason,\" Rowan saidtiredly. She nodded toward the hole. \"So they\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen suspicious for a while-for how long?\" She looked at Mary-Lynnette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you dig the hole Tuesday night,\" MaryLynnette said. She nodded toward the hole. \"Is that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour aunt in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief silence and Rowan looked selfconscious. Then she inclined her head slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGracefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell,\" Mark said. His eyes were shut and his head was rolling on his neck. \"Oh,hell. They\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egot Mrs. B. in a bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two days,\" Rowan said to Jade. \"They\u0027ve suspected for two whole days. And we can\u0027t remove\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ememories that are interlaced with other things for that long. We\u0027d never know if we got them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we could just takeeverything for the last two days,\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel snorted. \"And have two more people wandering around with lost time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s mind went click. \"Todd Akers andVic Kimble,\" she said. \"You did something to give\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem amnesia.I knew there had to be a connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no other choice for us,\" Kestrel said quietly to Rowan. \"And you know it as well as I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s not being malicious, Mary-Lynnette realized.Just practical. If a lioness or a wolf or a falcon could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etalk, it would say the same thing. \"We have to either kill or die; it\u0027s as simple as that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite herself, Mary-Lynnette felt something like fascination-and respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark had his eyes open now. And Rowan was looking sad, so sad. It\u0027s awful, her expression said, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody here is going to have to get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan bowed her head, then lifted it to face MaryLynnette directly. Their eyes met, held. After a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoment Rowan\u0027s face changed slightly and she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette knew that in that instant they werecommunicating without words. Each recognizing the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother as an alpha female who was willing to fightand die for her kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeaning they were both big sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, somebody\u0027s going to get hurt, Mary-Lynnette thought. You threaten myfamily,I fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew Rowan understood. Rowan was going to really hate killing her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" a voice said passionately, and MaryLynnette realized it was Jade. And the next second\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was on her feet, hands clenched, words erupting like a steam boiler exploding. \"No, youcan\u0027tkill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark. I won\u0027tletyou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan said, \"Jade, I know this is hard-\"Kestrel said, \"Jade, don\u0027t be a wimp-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was trembling, body tensed like a cat ready to fight. Her voice was louder than either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just can\u0027t do itl I think -Ithink-\" \"Jade-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thinkhe\u0027s my soulmate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Rowan groaned. \"Oh, dear...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel said, \"Oh,sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both looking at Jade. Focused on her. Mary-Lynnette thought, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung the flashlight viciously at Kestrel, wanting to take her out first, betting that Rowan would stay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind if Kestrel were hurt. But the swing never connected, Mark threw himself in front of her, slamming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t hurt Jade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen everything was just a mad tangle. Arms, legs,grasping fingers, kicking feet. Jade and Mark both\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyelling for it to stop. Mary-Lynnette felt the flashlight wrenched out of her hand. She found long hair, got\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehold of it, yanked. Someone kicked her, and pain blossomed in her ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she felt herself being dragged backward Mark was holding her, pulling her away from thefight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was lying on top of Kestrel and clutching at Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody was panting. Mark was almost crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just can\u0027t do this,\" he said. \"This is terrible.This is all wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile Jade was snarling, \"He\u0027s my soulmate,okay?Okay? I can\u0027t do anything with himdead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not your soulmate, idiot,\" Kestrel said in a somewhat muffled voice. She was facedown on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecarpet of needles. \"When you\u0027re soulmates, it hits you like lightning, and you know that\u0027s the one person\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the world you were meant to be with. Youdon\u0027tthink you\u0027re soulmates; you just know it\u0027s your destiny\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhether you like it or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, deep in Mary-Lynnette\u0027s brain, something stirred in alarm. But she had more urgentthings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, get out of here,\" she said breathlessly. ?Run!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark didn\u0027t even ease his grip. \"Why do we have to be enemies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, they\u0027re killers .You can\u0027t justify that. They killed their own aunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree faces turned toward her, startled. A half-fullmoon had risen above the trees, and Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould see them clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didnot!\" Jade said indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What made you think that?\" Rowan asked.Mary-Lynnette felt her mouth hang open. \"Be cause\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou buried her, for God\u0027s sakel\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but we found her dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody staked her,\" Kestrel said, brushingpine needles out of her golden hair. \"Probably a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire hunter. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d know anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark gulped. \"Staked her-with a stake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, with a picket from the fence,\" Kestrel said. \"She was already dead?\" Mary-Lynnette said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoRowan. \"But then why on earth did you bury her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the backyard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have been disrespectful to leave her in the cellar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But why didn\u0027t you have her taken to a cemetery?\"Rowan looked dismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade said, \"Um, you haven\u0027t seen Aunt Opal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not looking so good,\" Kestrel said. \"Kind ofhard and stiff. You might say mummified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what happens to us,\" Rowan said almostapologetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette slumped back against Mark, trying to get her new world view into place. Everything was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhirling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So... you were just trying to hide her. But ... you did do something to Todd Akers and Vic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKim-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Theyattackedus,\" Jade interrupted. \"They were thinking very bad things and they pinched our\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They-?\" Mary-Lynnette sat up suddenly. All at once she understood. \"Oh, my God. Those jerks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn\u0027t she thought of that? Todd and Vielast year there bad been rumors about them jumping some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirl from Westgrove. So they\u0027d tried it on these girls, and ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette gasped and then snorted with half inhaled laughter. \"Oh, no. Oh, I hope you got them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just bit them a little,\" Rowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I\u0027d been there tosee it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was laughing. Rowan was smiling. Kestrel was grinning barbarically. And suddenly Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew that they weren\u0027t going to fight anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody took a deep breath and sat back and looked at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey do look different from normal humans, Mary-Lynnette thought, staring at them in the moonlight. It\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso obvious once you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wereinhumanly beautiful, of course. Rowanwith her soft chestnut hair and sweet face; Kestrelwith\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher feral sleekness and golden eyes; Jade with her delicate features and her hair like starshine. Likethe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree Graces, only fiercer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Rowan said softly. \"We seem to have asituation here.

He and Jadewere gazing at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got Romeo and Juliet on our hands here is what we\u0027ve got,\" Mary-Lynnette said to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kestrel was speaking to Rowan, too. \"No matterwhatthey promise, how do we know we can be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elieve them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan considered, eyes roving around the clearing. Then she let out a long breath and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only one way,\" she said. \"Blood-tie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel\u0027s eyebrowsflew up. \"Oh, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Mary-Lynnette asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blood-tie?\" Rowan looked helpless. \"Well, it\u0027s akinship ceremony, you know.\" When\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette just looked at her, she went on: \"It makes our families related. It\u0027s like, one of our\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eancestors did it with a family of witches.:\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitches, Mary-Lynnette thought. Oh ...gosh. Sowitches are real, too. I wonder how many other things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eare real that I don\u0027t know about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires don\u0027t usually get along with witches,\" Rowan was saying. \"And HunterRedfern-that\u0027s our\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eancestor-had a real blood feud going with themback in the sixteen hundreds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then he couldn\u0027t have kids,\" Jade said gleefully. \"And he needed a witch to help or the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewholeRedfern familywould end with him. So he had to apologize and do a kinship ceremony. And then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe had all daughters.Ha ha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette blinked. Ha ha?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you see, we\u0027re part witch. All the Redfern are,\" Rowan was explaining in her gentle teachingvoice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our father used to say that\u0027s why we\u0027re so disobedient,\" Jade said. \"Because it\u0027s in our genes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause in witchfamilies, womenare in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette began to like witches. \"Ha ha,\" shesaid. Mark gave her a skittish sideways look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point is that we could do a ceremony like that now,\" Rowan said. \"It would make us family\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforever. We couldn\u0027t betray each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Mark said, still looking at Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine with me,\"Jade said, and gave him a quick, fierce smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mary-Lynnette was thinking. It was a serious thing Rowan was talking about. You couldn\u0027t do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething like this on a whim. It was worse than adopting a puppy; it was more like getting married. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas a lifetimeresponsibility. And even if these girls didn\u0027t kill humans, they killed animals. With their teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut so did people.

Wasit worse to drink deer blood than to make baby cows\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto boots?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, strange as it seemed, she felt dose to the three sisters already. In the last couple of minutesshe\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eestablished more of a relationship with Rowanthan she ever had with any girl at school. Fascination and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erespect had turned into a weird kind of instinctive trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd besidethat, what other real choice was there? Mary-Lynnette looked at mark, and then atRowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan turned to Kestrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m supposed to decide, am I?\" Kestrel said.\"We can\u0027t do it without you,\" Rowan said. \"You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel looked away. Her golden eyes were narrowed. In the moonlight her profile was absolutely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperfect against the darkness of trees. \"It would mean we could never go home again. Make ourselves kin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto vermin? That\u0027s what they\u0027dsay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s vermin?\" Mark said, jolted out of his communion with Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody answered. Jade said, with odd dignity, \"Ican\u0027t go home, anyway. I\u0027m in love with an Outsider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m going to tell him about the Night World. SoI\u0027m dead no matter what.\" Mark was opening his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emouth-to protest that Jade shouldn\u0027t take such arisk forhim,Mary-Lynnette thought-when Jade added\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabsently, \"And so is he, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark shut his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan said \"Kestrel, we\u0027ve come too far to go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel stared at the forest for another minute orso. Then suddenly she turned back to the others,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elaughing. There was something wild in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, let\u0027s go the whole way,\" she said. \"Tell them everything. Break every rule. We might as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette felt a twinge. She hoped she wasn\u0027tgoing to regret this. But what she said was \"Just how\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo we do this-ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exchange blood. I\u0027ve never done it before, but it\u0027s simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be a little bit strange, though,\" Jade said \"because you\u0027ll be a little bit vampires\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little bit what?\" Mary-Lynnette said, her voice rising in spite of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little bit.\" Jade was measuring out tiny bitsof air between her index finger and thumb. \"A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel cast a look skyward. \"It\u0027ll go away in a few days,\" she said heavily, which was what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryLynnette wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you don\u0027t get yourself bitten by a vampire again in the meanwhile,\" Rowan added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Otherwise, it\u0027s perfectly safe. Honestly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette and Mark exchanged glances. Not to discuss things, they\u0027d gone beyond that now. Just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto brace themselves. Then Mary-Lynnette took a deep breath and flicked a bit of fern off her knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said, feeling lightheaded but determined. \"We\u0027re ready.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-9.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM"}
