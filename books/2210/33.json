The sound filled the tower, and the scent of him came through the stone walls: succulent, oh so succulent, smell of living flesh and blood, his flesh and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not do this thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSymphony of malice, symphony of madness coming through the walls, straining to contain the ghastly images, the torture, to surround it with language . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stepped into the stairwell, it was like being caught in a whirlwind of his cries, his human smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the remembered scents mingled with it -- the afternoon sunshine on a wooden table, the red wine, the smoke of the little fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat! Do you hear me! Lestat!\" Thunder of fists against the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory of childhood fairy tale: the giant says he smells the blood of a human in his lair. Horror. I knew the giant was going to find the human. I could hear him coming after the human, step by step. I was the human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke and salt and flesh and pumping blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the witches\u0027 place! Lestat, do you hear me! This is the witches\u0027 place!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDull tremor of the old secrets between us, the love, the things that only we had known, felt. Dancing in the witches\u0027 place. Can you deny it? Can you deny everything that passed between us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet him out of France. Send him to the New World. And then what? All his life he is one of those slightly interesting but generally tiresome mortals who have seen spirits, talk of them incessantly, and no one believes him. Deepening madness. Will he be a comical lunatic finally, the kind that even the ruffians and bullies look after, playing his fiddle in a dirty coat for the crowds on the streets of Port-au-Prince?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be the puppeteer again,\" she had said. Is that what I was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one will ever believe his mad tales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he knows the place where we lie, Mother. He knows our names, the name of our kin -- too many things about us. And he will never go quietly to another country. And they may go after him; they will never let him live now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went up the stairs in the whirlwind of his echoing cries, looked out the little barred window at the open land. They\u0027ll be coming again. They have to come. First I was alone, then I had her with me, and now I have them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was the crux? That he wanted it? That he had screamed over and over that I had denied him the power?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was it that I now had the excuses I needed to bring him to me as I had wanted to do from the first moment? My Nicolas, my love. Eternity awaits. All the great and splendid pleasures of being dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went further up the stairs towards him and the thirst sang in me. To hell with his cries. The thirst sang and I was an instrument of its singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his cries had become inarticulate -- the pure essence of his curses, a dull punctuating to the misery that I could hear without need of any sound. Something divinely carnal in the broken syllables coming from his lips, like the low gush of blood through his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted the key and put it in the lock and he went silent, his thoughts washing backwards and into him as if the ocean could be sucked back into the tiny mysterious coils of a single shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to see him in the shadows of the room, and not it the love for him, the aching, wrenching months of longing for him, the hideous and unshakable human need for him, the lust. I tried to see the mortal who didn\u0027t know what he was saying as he glared at me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, and your talk of goodness\" -- low seething voice, eyes glittering -- \"your talk of good and evil, your talk of what was right and what was wrong and death, oh yes, death, the horror, the tragedy . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords. Borne on the ever swelling current of hatred, like flowers opening in the current, petals peeling back, then falling apart:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . and you shared it with her, the lord\u0027s son giveth to the lord\u0027s wife his great gift, the Dark Gift. Those who live in the castle share the Dark Gift -- never were they dragged to the witches\u0027 place where the human grease pools on the ground at the foot of the burnt stake, no, kill the old crone who can no longer see to sew, and the idiot boy who cannot till the field. And what does he give us, the lord\u0027s son, the wolfkiller, the one who screamed in the witches\u0027 place? Coin of the realm! That\u0027s good enough for us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuddering. Shirt soaked with sweat. Gleam of taut flesh through the torn lace. Tantalizing, the mere sight of it, the narrow tightly muscled torso that sculptors so love to represent, nipples pink against the dark skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This power\" -- sputtering as if all day long he had been saying the words over with the same intensity, and it does not really matter that now I am present -- \"this power that made all the lies meaningless, this dark power that soared over everything, this truth that obliterated. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Language. No truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine bottles were empty, the food devoured. His lean arms were hardened and tense for the struggle -- but what struggle? -- his brown hair fallen out of its ribbon, his eyes enormous and glazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly he pushed against the wall as if he\u0027d go through it to get away from me -- dim remembrance of their drinking from him, the paralysis, the ecstasy -- yet he was drawn immediately forward again, staggering, putting his hands out to steady himself by taking hold of things that were not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his voice had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething breaking in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you keep it from me!\" he whispered. Thoughts of old magic, luminous legend, some great eerie strata in which all the shadowy things thrived, an intoxication with forbidden knowledge in which the natural things become unimportant. No miracle anymore to the leaves falling from the autumn trees, the sun in the orchard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent was rising from him like incense, like the heat and the smoke of church candles rising. Heart thumping under the skin of his naked chest. Tight little belly glistening with sweat, sweat staining the thick leather belt. Blood full of salt. I could scarce breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we do breathe. We breathe and we taste and we smell and we feel and we thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have misunderstood everything.\" Is this Lestat speaking? It sounded like some other demon, some loathsome thing for whom the voice was the imitation of a human voice. \"You have misunderstood everything you have seen and heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have shared anything I possessed with you!\" Rage building again. He reached out. \"It was you who never understood,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your life and leave with it. Run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see it\u0027s the confirmation of everything? That it exists is the confirmation -- pure evil, sublime evil!\" Triumph in his eyes. He reached out suddenly and closed his hand on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t taunt me!\" I said. I struck him so hard he fell back wards, chastened, silent. \"When it was offered me I said no. I tell you I said no. With my last breath, I said no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were always the fool,\" he said. \"I told you that.\" But he was breaking down. He was shuddering and the rage was alchemizing into desperation. He lifted his arms again and then stopped. \"You believed things that didn\u0027t matter,\" he said almost gently. \"There was something you failed to see. Is it impossible you don\u0027t know yourself what you possess now?\" The glaze over his eyes broke instantly into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face knotted. Unspoken words coming from him of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd an awful self-consciousness came over me. Silent and lethal, I felt myself flooded with the power I had over him and his knowledge of it, and my love for him heated the sense of power, driving it towards a scorching embarrassment which suddenly changed into something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in the wings of the theater again; we were in the village in Auvergne in that little inn. I smelled not merely the blood in him, but the sudden terror. He had taken a step back. And the very movement stoked the blaze in me, as much as the vision of his stricken face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grew smaller, more fragile. Yet he\u0027d never seemed stronger, more alluring than he was now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the expression drained from his face as I drew nearer. His eyes were wondrously clear. And his mind was opening as Gabrielle\u0027s mind had opened, and for one tiny second there flared a moment of us together in the garret, talking and talking as the moon glared on the snow-covered roofs, or walking through the Paris streets, passing the wine back and forth, heads bowed against the first gust of winter rain, and there had been the eternity of growing up and growing old before us, and so much joy even in misery, even in the misery -- the real eternity, the real forever -- the mortal mystery of that. But the moment faded in the shimmering expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to me, Nicki,\" I whispered. I lifted both hands to beckon. \"If you want it, you must come...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw a bird soaring out of a cave above the open sea. And there was something terrifying about the bird and the endless waves over which it flew. Higher and higher it went and the sky turned to silver and then gradually the silver faded and the sky went dark. The darkness of evening nothing to fear, really, nothing. Blessed darkness. But it was falling gradually and inexorably over nothing save this one tiny creature cawing in the wind above a great wasteland that was the world. Empty caves, empty sands, empty sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I had ever loved to look upon, or listen to, or felt with my hands was gone, or never existed, and the bird, circling and gliding, flew on and on, upwards past me, or more truly past no one, holding the entire landscape, without history or meaning, in the flat blackness of one tiny eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed but without a sound. I felt my mouth full of blood and each swallow passing down my throat and into fathomless thirst. And I wanted to say, yes, I understand now, I understand how terrible, how unbearable, this darkness. I didn\u0027t know. Couldn\u0027t know. The bird sailing on through the darkness over the barren shore, the seamless sea. Dear God, stop it. Worse than the horror in the inn. Worse than the helpless trumpeting of the fallen horse in the snow. But the blood was the blood after all, and the heart -- the luscious heart that was all hearts -- was right there, on tiptoe against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, my love, now\u0027s the moment. I can swallow the life that beats from your heart and send you into the oblivion in which nothing may ever be understood or forgiven, or I can bring you to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed him backwards. I held him to me like a crushed thing. But the vision wouldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms slipped around my neck, his face wet, eyes rolling up into his head. Then his tongue shot out. It licked hard at the gash I had made for him in my own throat. Yes, eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut please stop this vision. Stop the upward flight and the great slant of the colorless landscape, the cawing that meant nothing over the howl of the wind. The pain is nothing compared to this darkness. I don\u0027t want to ... I don\u0027t want to . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was dissolving. Slowly dissolving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally it was finished. The veil of silence had come down, as it had with her. Silence. He was separate. And I was holding him away from me, and he was almost falling, his hands to his mouth, the blood running down his chin in rivulets. His mouth was open and a dry sound came out of it, in spite of the blood, a dry scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd beyond him, and beyond the remembered vision of the metallic sea and the lone bird who was its only witness -- I saw her in the doorway and her hair was a Virgin Mary veil of gold around her shoulders, and she said with the saddest expression on her face:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disaster, my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy midnight it was clear that he would not speak or answer to any voice, or move of his own volition. He remained still and expressionless in the places to which he was taken. If the death pained him he gave no sign. If the new vision delighted him, he kept it to himself. Not even the thirst moved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was Gabrielle who, after studying him quietly for hours, took him in hand, cleaning him and putting new clothes on him. Black wool she chose, one of the few somber coats I owned. And modest linen that made him look oddly like a young cleric, a little too serious, a little naive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the silence of the crypt as I watched them, I knew without doubt that they could hear each other\u0027s thoughts. Without a word she guided him through the grooming. Without a word she sent him back to the bench by the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she said, \"He should hunt now,\" and when she glanced at him, he rose without looking at her as if pulled by a string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumbly I watched them going. Heard their feet on the stairs. And then I crept up after them, stealthily, and holding to the bars of the gate I watched them move, two feline spirits, across the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emptiness of the night was an indissoluble cold settling over me, closing me in. Not even the fire on the hearth warmed me when I returned to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmptiness here. And the quiet I had told myself that I wanted -- just to be alone after the grisly struggle in Paris. Quiet, and the realization gnawing at my insides like a starved animal -- that I couldn\u0027t stand the sight of him now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-33.html","bookId":2210,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM"}
