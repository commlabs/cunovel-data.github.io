My skin had cooled to match the air around me, and the tiny pieces of ice felt like velvet under my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky above me was clear, brilliant with stars, glowing blue in some places, yellow in others. The stars created majestic, swirling shapes against the black universe - an awesome sight. Exquisitely beautiful. Or rather, it should have been exquisite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould have been, if I\u0027d been able to really see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t getting any better. Six days had passed, six days I\u0027d hidden here in the empty Denali wilderness, but I was no closer to freedom than I had been since the first moment that I\u0027d caught her scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stared up at the jeweled sky, it was as if there were an obstruction between my eyes and their beauty. The obstruction was a face, just an unremarkable human face, but I couldn\u0027t quite seem to banish it from my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the approaching thoughts before I heard the footsteps that accompanied them. The sound of movement was only a faint whisper against the powder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not surprised that Tanya had followed me here. I knew she\u0027d been mulling over this coming conversation for the last few days, putting it off until she was sure of exactly what she wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprang into sight about sixty yards away, leaping onto the tip of an outcropping of black rock and balancing there on the balls of her bare feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya\u0027s skin was silver in the starlight, and her long blond curls shone pale, almost pink with their strawberry tint. Her amber eyes glinted as she spied me, halfburied in the snow, and her full lips stretched slowly into a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExquisite. If I\u0027d really been able to see her. I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouched down on the point of the stone, her fingertips touching the rock, her body coiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCannonball, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe launched herself into the air; her shape became a dark, twisting shadow as she spun gracefully between me and the stars. She curled herself into a ball just as she struck the piled snow bank beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blizzard of snow flew up around me. The stars went black and I was buried deep in the feathery ice crystals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed again, but didn\u0027t move to unearth myself. The blackness under the snow neither hurt nor improved the view. I still saw the same face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen snow was flying again as Tanya swiftly disinterred me. She brushed the powder from my unmoving face, not quite meeting my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she murmured. \"It was a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It was funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth twisted down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irina and Kate said I should leave you alone. They think I\u0027m annoying you.\" \"Not at all,\" I assured her. \"On the contrary, I\u0027m the one who\u0027s being rude - abominably rude. I\u0027m very sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re going home, aren\u0027t you? she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t...entirely...decided that yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you\u0027re not staying here. Her thought was wistful now, sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It doesn\u0027t seem to be...helping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaced. \"That\u0027s my fault, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I lied smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be a gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make you uncomfortable, she accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised one eyebrow, her expression so disbelieving that I had to laugh. One short laugh, followed by another sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I admitted. \"A little bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, too, and put her chin in her hands. Her thoughts were chagrined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a thousand times lovelier than the stars, Tanya. Of course, you\u0027re already well aware of that. Don\u0027t let my stubbornness undermine your confidence.\" I chuckled at the unlikeliness of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not used to rejection,\" she grumbled, her lower lip pushing out into an attractive pout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly not,\" I agreed, trying with little success to block out her thoughts as she fleetingly sifted through memories of her thousands of successful conquests. Mostly Tanya preferred human men - they were much more populous for one thing, with the added advantage of being soft and warm. And always eager, definitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Succubus,\" I teased, hoping to interrupt the images flickering in her head. She grinned, flashing her teeth. \"The original.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Carlisle, Tanya and her sisters had discovered their consciences slowly. In the end, it was their fondness for human men that turned the sisters against the slaughter. Now the men they loved...lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you showed up here,\" Tanya said slowly. \"I thought that...\" I\u0027d known what she\u0027d thought. And I should have guessed that she would have felt that way. But I hadn\u0027t been at my best for analytical thinking in that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought that I\u0027d changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel horrible for toying with your expectations, Tanya. I didn\u0027t mean to - I wasn\u0027t thinking. It\u0027s just that I left in...quite a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d tell me why...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up and wrapped my arms around my legs, curling defensively. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya, Irina and Kate were very good at this life they\u0027d committed to. Better, in some ways, than even Carlisle. Despite the insanely close proximity they allowed themselves with those who should be - and once were - their prey, they did not make mistakes. I was too ashamed to admit my weakness to Tanya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woman troubles?\" she guessed, ignoring my reluctance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed a bleak laugh. \"Not the way you mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet then. I listened to her thoughts as she ran through different guesses, tried to decipher the meaning of my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not even close,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One hint?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please let it go, Tanya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet again, still speculating. I ignored her, trying in vain to appreciate the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave up after a silent moment, and her thoughts pursued a new direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere will you go, Edward, if you leave? Back to Carlisle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere would I go? I could not think of one place on the entire planet that held any interest for me. There was nothing I wanted to see or do. Because, no matter where I went, I would not be going to anywhere - I would only be running from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated that. When had I become such a coward?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya threw her slender arm around my shoulders. I stiffened, but did not flinch out from under her touch. She meant it as nothing more than friendly comfort. Mostly. \"I think that you will go back,\" she said, her voice taking on just a hint of her long lost Russian accent. \"No matter what it is...or who it is...that is haunting you. You\u0027ll face it head on. You\u0027re the type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts were as certain as her words. I tried to embrace the vision of myself that she carried in her head. The one who faced things head on. It was pleasant to think of myself that way again. I\u0027d never doubted my courage, my ability to face difficulty, before that horrible hour in a high school biology class such a short time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her cheek, pulling back swiftly when she twisted her face toward mine, her lips already puckered. She smiled ruefully at my quickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Tanya. I needed to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts turned petulant. \"You\u0027re welcome, I guess. I wish you would be more reasonable about things, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Tanya. You know you\u0027re too good for me. I just...haven\u0027t found what I\u0027m looking for yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you leave before I see you again...goodbye, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, Tanya.\" As I said the words, I could see it. I could see myself leaving. Being strong enough to go back to the one place where I wanted to be. \"Thanks again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on her feet in one nimble move, and then she was running away, ghosting across the snow so quickly that her feet had no time to sink into the snow; she left no prints behind her. She didn\u0027t look back. My rejection bothered her more than she\u0027d let on before, even in her thoughts. She wouldn\u0027t want to see me again before I left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth twisted with chagrin. I didn\u0027t like hurting Tanya, though her feelings were not deep, hardly pure, and, in any case, not something I could return. It still made me feel less than a gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my chin on my knees and stared up at the stars again, though I was suddenly anxious to be on my way. I knew that Alice would see me coming home, that she would tell the others. This would make them happy - Carlisle and Esme especially. But I gazed at the stars for one more moment, trying to see past the face in my head. Between me and the brilliant lights in the sky, a pair of bewildered chocolate-brown eyes stared back at me, seeming to ask what this decision would mean for her. Of course, I couldn\u0027t be sure if that was really the information her curious eyes sought. Even in my imagination, I couldn\u0027t hear her thoughts. Bella Swan\u0027s eyes continued to question, and an unobstructed view of the stars continued to elude me. With a heavy sigh, I gave up, and got to my feet. If I ran, I would be back to Carlisle\u0027s car in less than an hour...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a hurry to see my family - and wanting very much to be the Edward that faced things head on - I raced across the starlit snowfield, leaving no footprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be okay,\" Alice breathed. Her eyes were unfocused, and Jasper had one hand lightly under her elbow, guiding her forward as we walked into the rundown cafeteria in a close group. Rosalie and Emmett led the way, Emmett looking ridiculously like a bodyguard in the middle of hostile territory. Rose looked wary, too, but much more irritated than protective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is,\" I grumbled. Their behavior was ludicrous. If I wasn\u0027t positive that I could handle this moment, I would have stayed home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden shift from our normal, even playful morning - it had snowed in the night, and Emmett and Jasper were not above taking advantage of my distraction to bombard me with slushballs; when they got bored with my lack of response, they\u0027d turned on each other - to this overdone vigilance would have been comical if it weren\u0027t so irritating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not here yet, but the way she\u0027s going to come in...she won\u0027t be downwind if we sit in our regular spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we\u0027ll sit in our regular spot. Stop it, Alice. You\u0027re getting on my nerves. I\u0027ll be absolutely fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked once as Jasper helped her into her seat, and her eyes finally focused on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" she said, sounding surprised. \"I think you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated being the focus of their concern. I felt a sudden sympathy for Jasper, remembering all the times we\u0027d hovered protectively over him. He met my glance briefly, and grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoying, isn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it just last week that this long, drab room had seemed so killingly dull to me? That it had seemed almost like sleep, like a coma, to be here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday my nerves were stretched tight - piano wires, tensed to sing at the lightest pressure. My senses were hyper-alert; I scanned every sound, every sight, every movement of the air that touched my skin, every thought. Especially the thoughts. There was only one sense that I kept locked down, refused to use. Smell, of course. I didn\u0027t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was expecting to hear more about the Cullens in the thoughts that I sifted through. All day I\u0027d been waiting, searching for whichever new acquaintance Bella Swan might have confided in, trying to see the direction the new gossip would take. But there was nothing. No one noticed the five vampires in the cafeteria, just the same as before the new girl had come. Several of the humans here were still thinking of that girl, still thinking the same thoughts from last week. Instead of finding this unutterably boring, I was now fascinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she said nothing to anyone about me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way that she had not noticed my black, murderous glare. I had seen her react to it. Surely, I\u0027d scared her silly. I had been convinced that she would have mentioned it to someone, maybe even exaggerated the story a bit to make it better. Given me a few menacing lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, she\u0027d also heard me trying to get out of our shared biology class. She must have wondered, after seeing my expression, whether she were the cause. A normal girl would have asked around, compared her experience to others, looked for common ground that would explain my behavior so she didn\u0027t feel singled out. Humans were constantly desperate to feel normal, to fit in. To blend in with everyone else around them, like a featureless flock of sheep. The need was particularly strong during the insecure adolescent years. This girl would be no exception to that rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one at all took any notice of us sitting here, at our normal table. Bella must be exceptionally shy, if she\u0027d confided in no one. Perhaps she had spoken to her father, maybe that was the strongest relationship...though that seemed unlikely, given the fact that she had spent so little time with him throughout her life. She would be closer to her mother. Still, I would have to pass by Chief Swan sometime soon and listen to what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything new?\" Jasper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. She...must not have said anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them raised an eyebrow at this news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027re not as scary as you think you are,\" Emmett said, chuckling. \"I bet I could have frightened her better than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder why...?\" He puzzled again over my revelation about the girl\u0027s unique silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been over that. I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s coming in,\" Alice murmured then. I felt my body go rigid. \"Try to look human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human, you say?\" Emmett asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his right fist, twisting his fingers to reveal the snowball he\u0027d saved in his palm. Of course it had not melted there. He\u0027d squeezed it into a lumpy block of ice. He had his eyes on Jasper, but I saw the direction of his thoughts. So did Alice, of course. When he abruptly hurled the ice chunk at her, she flicked it away with a casual flutter of her fingers. The ice ricocheted across the length of the cafeteria, too fast to be visible to human eyes, and shattered with a sharp crack against the brick wall. The brick cracked, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heads in that corner of the room all turned to stare at the pile of broken ice on the floor, and then swiveled to find the culprit. They didn\u0027t look further than a few tables away. No one looked at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very human, Emmett,\" Rosalie said scathingly. \"Why don\u0027t you punch through the wall while you\u0027re at it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would look more impressive if you did it, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pay attention to them, keeping a grin fixed on my face like I was part of their banter. I did not allow myself to look toward the line where I knew she was standing. But that was all that I was listening to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Jessica\u0027s impatience with the new girl, who seemed to be distracted, too, standing motionless in the moving line. I saw, in Jessica\u0027s thoughts, that Bella Swan\u0027s cheeks were once more colored bright pink with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled in short, shallow breaths, ready to quit breathing if any hint of her scent touched the air near me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Newton was with the two girls. I heard both his voices, mental and verbal, when he asked Jessica what was wrong with the Swan girl. I didn\u0027t like the way his thoughts wrapped around her, the flicker of already established fantasies that clouded his mind while he watched her start and look up from her reverie like she\u0027d forgotten he was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I heard Bella say in that quiet, clear voice. It seemed to ring like a bell over the babble in the cafeteria, but I knew that was just because I was listening for it so intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just get a soda today,\" she continued as she moved to catch up with the line. I couldn\u0027t help flickering one glance in her direction. She was staring at the floor, the blood slowly fading from her face. I looked away quickly, to Emmett, who laughed at the now pained-looking smile on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou look sick, bro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rearranged my features so the expression would seem casual and effortless. Jessica was wondering aloud about the girl\u0027s lack of appetite. \"Aren\u0027t you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I feel a little sick.\" Her voice was lower, but still very clear. Why did it bother me, the protective concern that suddenly emanated from Mike Newton\u0027s thoughts? What did it matter that there was a possessive edge to them? It wasn\u0027t my business if Mike Newton felt unnecessarily anxious for her. Perhaps this was the way everyone responded to her. Hadn\u0027t I wanted, instinctively, to protect her, too? Before I\u0027d wanted to kill her, that is...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was the girl ill?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to judge - she looked so delicate with her translucent skin... Then I realized that I was worrying, too, just like that dimwitted boy, and I forced myself not to think about her health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, I didn\u0027t like monitoring her through Mike\u0027s thoughts. I switched to Jessica\u0027s, watching carefully as the three of them chose which table to sit at. Fortunately, they sat with Jessica\u0027s usual companions, at one of the first tables in the room. Not downwind, just as Alice had promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice elbowed me. She\u0027s going to look soon, act human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my teeth behind my grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ease up, Edward,\" Emmett said. \"Honestly. So you kill one human. That\u0027s hardly the end of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would know,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett laughed. \"You\u0027ve got to learn to get over things. Like I do. Eternity is a long time to wallow in guilt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, Alice tossed a smaller handful of ice that she\u0027d been hiding into Emmett\u0027s unsuspecting face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, surprised, and then grinned in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked for it,\" he said as he leaned across the table and shook his iceencrusted hair in her direction. The snow, melting in the warm room, flew out from his hair in a thick shower of half-liquid, half-ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ew!\" Rose complained, as she and Alice recoiled from the deluge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice laughed, and we all joined in. I could see in Alice\u0027s head how she\u0027d orchestrated this perfect moment, and I knew that the girl - I should stop thinking of her that way, as if she were the only girl in the world - that Bella would be watching us laugh and play, looking as happy and human and unrealistically ideal as a Norman Rockwell painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice kept laughing, and held her tray up as a shield. The girl - Bella must still be staring at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...staring at the Cullens again, someone thought, catching my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked automatically toward the unintentional call, realizing as my eyes found their destination that I recognized the voice - I\u0027d been listening to it so much today. But my eyes slid right past Jessica, and focused on the girl\u0027s penetrating gaze. She looked down quickly, hiding behind her thick hair again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she thinking? The frustration seemed to be getting more acute as time went on, rather than dulling. I tried - uncertain in what I was doing for I\u0027d never tried this before - to probe with my mind at the silence around her. My extra hearing had always come to me naturally, without asking; I\u0027d never had to work at it. But I concentrated now, trying to break through whatever shield surrounded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing but silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it about her? Jessica thought, echoing my own frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" she whispered in the Swan girl\u0027s ear, adding a giggle. There was no hint of her jealous irritation in her tone. Jessica seemed to be skilled at feigning friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened, too engrossed, to the girl\u0027s response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t look angry, does he?\" she whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she had noticed my wild reaction last week. Of course she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question confused Jessica. I saw my own face in her thoughts as she checked my expression, but I did not meet her glance. I was still concentrating on the girl, trying to hear something. My intent focus didn\u0027t seem to be helping at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jess told her, and I knew that she wished she could say yes - how it rankled inside her, my staring - though there was no trace of that in her voice. \"Should he be?\" \"I don\u0027t think he likes me,\" the girl whispered back, laying her head down on her arm as if she were suddenly tired. I tried to understand the motion, but I could only make guesses. Maybe she was tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Cullens don\u0027t like anybody,\" Jess reassured her. \"Well, they don\u0027t notice anybody enough to like them.\" They never used to. Her thought was a grumble of complaint. \"But he\u0027s still staring at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop looking at him,\" the girl said anxiously, lifting her head from her arm to make sure Jessica obeyed the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica giggled, but did as she was asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl did not look away from her table for the rest of the hour. I thought - though, of course, I could not be sure - that this was deliberate. It seemed like she wanted to look at me. Her body would shift slightly in my direction, her chin would begin to turn, and then she would catch herself, take a deep breath, and stare fixedly at whoever was speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the other thoughts around the girl for the most part, as they were not, momentarily, about her. Mike Newton was planning a snow fight in the parking lot after school, not seeming to realize that the snow had already shifted to rain. The flutter of soft flakes against the roof had become the more common patter of raindrops. Could he really not hear the change? It seemed loud to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the lunch period ended, I stayed in my seat. The humans filed out, and I caught myself trying to distinguish the sound of her footsteps from the sound of the rest, as if there was something important or unusual about them. How stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy family made no move to leave, either. They waited to see what I would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I go to class, sit beside the girl where I could smell the absurdly potent scent of her blood and feel the warmth of her pulse in the air on my skin? Was I strong enough for that? Or had I had enough for one day?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...think it\u0027s okay,\" Alice said, hesitant. \"Your mind is set. I think you\u0027ll make it through the hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Alice knew well how quickly a mind could change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why push it, Edward?\" Jasper asked. Though he didn\u0027t want to feel smug that I was the one who was weak now, I could hear that he did, just a little. \"Go home. Take it slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the big deal?\" Emmett disagreed. \"Either he will or he won\u0027t kill her. Might as well get it over with, either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to move yet,\" Rosalie complained. \"I don\u0027t want to start over. We\u0027re almost out of high school, Emmett. Finally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was evenly torn on the decision. I wanted, wanted badly, to face this head on rather than running away again. But I didn\u0027t want to push myself too far, either. It had been a mistake last week for Jasper to go so long without hunting; was this just as pointless a mistake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to uproot my family. None of them would thank me for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wanted to go to my biology class. I realized that I wanted to see her face again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what decided it for me. That curiosity. I was angry with myself for feeling it. Hadn\u0027t I promised myself that I wouldn\u0027t let the silence of the girl\u0027s mind make me unduly interested in her? And yet, here I was, most unduly interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to know what she was thinking. Her mind was closed, but her eyes were very open. Perhaps I could read them instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Rose, I think it really will be okay,\" Alice said. \"It\u0027s...firming up. I\u0027m ninety-three percent sure that nothing bad will happen if he goes to class.\" She looked at me inquisitively, wondering what had changed in my thoughts that made her vision of the future more secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould curiosity be enough to keep Bella Swan alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett was right, though - why not get it over with, either way? I would face the temptation head on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to class,\" I ordered, pushing away from the table. I turned and strode away from them without looking back. I could hear Alice\u0027s worry, Jasper\u0027s censure, Emmett\u0027s approval, and Rosalie\u0027s irritation trailing after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took one last deep breath at the door of the classroom, and then held it in my lungs as I walked into the small, warm space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not late. Mr. Banner was still setting up for today\u0027s lab. The girl sat at my - at our table, her face down again, staring at the folder she was doodling on. I examined the sketch as I approached, interested in even this trivial creation of her mind, but it was meaningless. Just a random scribbling of loops within loops. Perhaps she was not concentrating on the pattern, but thinking of something else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my chair back with unnecessary roughness, letting it scrape across the linoleum; humans always felt more comfortable when noise announced someone\u0027s approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew she heard the sound; she did not look up, but her hand missed a loop in the design she was drawing, making it unbalanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn\u0027t she look up? Probably she was frightened. I must be sure to leave her with a different impression this time. Make her think she\u0027d been imagining things before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" I said in the quiet voice I used when I wanted to make humans more comfortable, forming a polite smile with my lips that would not show any teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up then, her wide brown eyes startled - almost bewildered - and full of silent questions. It was the same expression that had been obstructing my vision for the last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stared into those oddly deep brown eyes, I realized that the hate - the hate I\u0027d imagined this girl somehow deserved for simply existing - had evaporated. Not breathing now, not tasting her scent, it was hard to believe that anyone so vulnerable could ever justify hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheeks began to flush, and she said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my eyes on hers, focusing only on their questioning depths, and tried to ignore the appetizing color of her skin. I had enough breath to speak for a while longer without inhaling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Edward Cullen,\" I said, though I knew she knew that. It was the polite way to begin. \"I didn\u0027t have a chance to introduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed confused - there was that little pucker between her eyes again. It took her half a second longer than it should have for her to respond. \"How do you know my name?\" she demanded, and her voice shook just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have truly terrified her. This made me feel guilty; she was just so defenseless. I laughed gently - it was a sound that I knew made humans more at ease. Again, I was careful about my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I think everyone knows your name.\" Surely she must have realized that she\u0027d become the center of attention in this monotonous place. \"The whole town\u0027s been waiting for you to arrive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned as if this information was unpleasant. I supposed, being shy as she seemed to be, attention would seem like a bad thing to her. Most humans felt the opposite. Though they didn\u0027t want to stand out from the herd, at the same time they craved a spotlight for their individual uniformity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"I meant, why did you call me Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you prefer Isabella?\" I asked, perplexed by the fact that I couldn\u0027t see where this question was leading. I didn\u0027t understand. Surely, she\u0027d made her preference clear many times that first day. Were all humans this incomprehensible without the mental context as a guide?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I like Bella,\" she answered, leaning her head slightly to one side. Her expression - if I was reading it correctly - was torn between embarrassment and confusion. \"But I think Charlie - I mean my dad - must call me Isabella behind my back. That\u0027s what everyone here seems to know me as.\" Her skin darkened one shade pinker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said lamely, and quickly looked away from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d just realized what her questions meant: I had slipped up - made an error. If I hadn\u0027t been eavesdropping on all the others that first day, then I would have addressed her initially by her full name, just like everyone else. She\u0027d noticed the difference. I felt a pang of unease. It was very quick of her to pick up on my slip. Quite astute, especially for someone who was supposed to be terrified by my nearness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had bigger problems than whatever suspicions about me she might be keeping locked inside her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was out of air. If I were going to speak to her again, I would have to inhale. It would be hard to avoid speaking. Unfortunately for her, sharing this table made her my lab partner, and we would have to work together today. It would seem odd - and incomprehensibly rude - for me to ignore her while we did the lab. It would make her more suspicious, more afraid...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned as far away from her as I could without moving my seat, twisting my head out into the aisle. I braced myself, locking my muscles in place, and then sucked in one quick chest-full of air, breathing through my mouth alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was genuinely painful. Even without smelling her, I could taste her on my tongue. My throat was suddenly in flames again, the craving every bit as strong as that first moment I\u0027d caught her scent last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gritted my teeth together and tried to compose myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get started,\" Mr. Banner commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like it took every single ounce of self-control that I\u0027d achieved in seventy years of hard work to turn back to the girl, who was staring down at the table, and smile. \"Ladies first, partner?\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at my expression and her face went blank, her eyes wide. Was there something off in my expression? Was she frightened again? She didn\u0027t speak. \"Or, I could start, if you wish,\" I said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, and her face went from white to red again. \"I\u0027ll go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the equipment on the table, the battered microscope, the box of slides, rather than watch the blood swirl under her clear skin. I took another quick breath, through my teeth, and winced as the taste made my throat ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prophase,\" she said after a quick examination. She started to remove the slide, though she\u0027d barely examined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind if I look?\" Instinctively - stupidly, as if I were one of her kind - I reached out to stop her hand from removing the slide. For one second, the heat of her skin burned into mine. It was like an electric pulse - surely much hotter than a mere ninety-eight point six degrees. The heat shot through my hand and up my arm. She yanked her hand out from under mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I muttered through my clenched teeth. Needing somewhere to look, I grasped the microscope and stared briefly into the eyepiece. She was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prophase,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still too unsettled to look at her. Breathing as quietly as I could through my gritted teeth and trying to ignore the fiery thirst, I concentrated on the simple assignment, writing the word on the appropriate line on the lab sheet, and then switching out the first slide for the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she thinking now? What had that felt like to her, when I had touched her hand? My skin must have been ice cold - repulsive. No wonder she was so quiet. I glanced at the slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anaphase,\" I said to myself as I wrote it on the second line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at her, surprised to see that she was waiting expectantly, one hand half-stretched toward the microscope. She didn\u0027t look afraid. Did she really think I\u0027d gotten the answer wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but smile at the hopeful look on her face as I slid the microscope toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared into the eyepiece with an eagerness that quickly faded. The corners of her mouth turned down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slide three?\" she asked, not looking up from the microscope, but holding out her hand. I dropped the next slide into her hand, not letting my skin come anywhere close to hers this time. Sitting beside her was like sitting next to a heat lamp. I could feel myself warming slightly to the higher temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not look at the slide for long. \"Interphase,\" she said nonchalantly - perhaps trying a little too hard to sound that way - and pushed the microscope to me. She did not touch the paper, but waited for me to write the answer. I checked - she was correct again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished this way, speaking one word at a time and never meeting each other\u0027s eyes. We were the only ones done - the others in the class were having a harder time with the lab. Mike Newton seemed to be having trouble concentrating - he was trying to watch Bella and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWish he\u0027d stayed wherever he went, Mike thought, eyeing me sulfurously. Hmm, interesting. I hadn\u0027t realized the boy harbored any ill will towards me. This was a new development, about as recent as the girl\u0027s arrival it seemed. Even more interesting, I found - to my surprise - that the feeling was mutual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the girl again, bemused by the wide range of havoc and upheaval that, despite her ordinary, unthreatening appearance, she was wreaking on my life. It wasn\u0027t that I couldn\u0027t see what Mike was going on about. She was actually rather pretty...in an unusual way. Better than being beautiful, her face was interesting. Not quite symmetrical - her narrow chin out of balance with her wide cheekbones; extreme in the coloring - the light and dark contrast of her skin and her hair; and then there were the eyes, brimming over with silent secrets...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes that were suddenly boring into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared back at her, trying to guess even one of those secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get contacts?\" she asked abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a strange question. \"No.\" I almost smiled at the idea of improving my eyesight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she mumbled. \"I thought there was something different about your eyes.\" I felt suddenly colder again as I realized that I was apparently not the only one attempting to ferret out secrets today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, my shoulders stiff, and glared straight ahead to where the teacher was making his rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course there was something different about my eyes since the last time she\u0027d stared into them. To prepare myself for today\u0027s ordeal, today\u0027s temptation, I\u0027d spent the entire weekend hunting, satiating my thirst as much as possible, overdoing it really. I\u0027d glutted myself on the blood of animals, not that it made much difference in the face of the outrageous flavor floating on the air around her. When I\u0027d glared at her last, my eyes had been black with thirst. Now, my body swimming with blood, my eyes were a warmer gold. Light amber from my excessive attempt at thirst-quenching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother slip. If I\u0027d seen what she\u0027d meant with her question, I could have just told her yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d sat beside humans for two years now at this school, and she was the first to examine me closely enough to note the change in my eye color. The others, while admiring the beauty of my family, tended to look down quickly when we returned their stares. They shied away, blocking the details of our appearances in an instinctive endeavor to keep themselves from understanding. Ignorance was bliss to the human mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did it have to be this girl who would see too much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Banner approached our table. I gratefully inhaled the gush of clean air he brought with him before it could mix with her scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Edward,\" he said, looking over our answers, \"didn\u0027t you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" I corrected him reflexively. \"Actually, she identified three of the five.\" Mr. Banner\u0027s thoughts were skeptical as he turned to look at the girl. \"Have you done this lab before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched, engrossed, as she smiled, looking slightly embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with onion root.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whitefish blastula?\" Mr. Banner probed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis surprised him. Today\u0027s lab was something he\u0027d pulled from a more advanced course. He nodded thoughtfully at the girl. \"Were you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was advanced then, intelligent for a human. This did not surprise me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Mr. Banner said, pursing his lips. \"I guess it\u0027s good you two are lab partners.\" He turned and walked away mumbling, \"So the other kids can get a chance to learn something for themselves,\" under his breath. I doubted the girl could hear that. She began scrawling loops across her folder again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo slips so far in one half hour. A very poor showing on my part. Though I had no idea at all what the girl thought of me - how much did she fear, how much did she suspect? - I knew I needed to put forth a better effort to leave her with a new impression of me. Something to better drown her memories of our ferocious last encounter. \"It\u0027s too bad about the snow, isn\u0027t it?\" I said, repeating the small talk that I\u0027d heard a dozen students discuss already. A boring, standard topic of conversation. The weather - always safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me with obvious doubt in her eyes - an abnormal reaction to my very normal words. \"Not really,\" she said, surprising me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to steer the conversation back to trite paths. She was from a much brighter, warmer place - her skin seemed to reflect that somehow, despite its fairness - and the cold must make her uncomfortable. My icy touch certainly had...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like the cold,\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or the wet,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live.\" Perhaps you should not have come here, I wanted to add. Perhaps you should go back where you belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure I wanted that, though. I would always remember the scent of her blood - was there any guarantee that I wouldn\u0027t eventually follow after her? Besides, if she left, her mind would forever remain a mystery. A constant, nagging puzzle. \"You have no idea,\" she said in a low voice, glowering past me for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answers were never what I expected. They made me want to ask more questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you come here, then?\" I demanded, realizing instantly that my tone was too accusatory, not casual enough for the conversation. The question sounded rude, prying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s...complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked her wide eyes, leaving it at that, and I nearly imploded out of curiosity - the curiosity burned as hot as the thirst in my throat. Actually, I found that it was getting slightly easier to breathe; the agony was becoming more bearable through familiarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can keep up,\" I insisted. Perhaps common courtesy would keep her answering my questions as long as I was rude enough to ask them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared down silently at her hands. This made me impatient; I wanted to put my hand under her chin and tilt her head up so that I could read her eyes. But it would be foolish of me - dangerous - to touch her skin again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up suddenly. It was a relief to be able to see the emotions in her eyes again. She spoke in a rush, hurrying through the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother got remarried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, this was human enough, easy to understand. Sadness passed through her clear eyes and brought the pucker back between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t sound so complex,\" I said. My voice was gentle without my working to make it that way. Her sadness left me feeling oddly helpless, wishing there was something I could do to make her feel better. A strange impulse. \"When did that happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last September.\" She exhaled heavily - not quite a sigh. I held my breath as her warm breath brushed my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t like him,\" I guessed, fishing for more information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Phil is fine,\" she said, correcting my assumption. There was a hint of a smile now around the corners of her full lips. \"Too young, maybe, but nice enough.\" This didn\u0027t fit with the scenario I\u0027d been constructing in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you stay with them?\" I asked, my voice a little too curious. It sounded like I was being nosy. Which I was, admittedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living.\" The little smile grew more pronounced; this career choice amused her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, too, without choosing to. I wasn\u0027t trying to make her feel at ease. Her smile just made me want to smile in response - to be in on the secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I heard of him?\" I ran through the rosters of professional ball players in my head, wondering which Phil was hers...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not. He doesn\u0027t play well.\" Another smile. \"Strictly minor league. He moves around a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rosters in my head shifted instantly, and I\u0027d tabulated a list of possibilities in less than a second. At the same time, I was imagining the new scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking assumptions seemed to get more information out of her than questions did. It worked again. Her chin jutted out, and her expression was suddenly stubborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she did not send me here,\" she said, and her voice had a new, hard edge to it. My assumption had upset her, though I couldn\u0027t quite see how. \"I sent myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not guess at her meaning, or the source behind her pique. I was entirely lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I gave up. There was just no making sense of the girl. She wasn\u0027t like other humans. Maybe the silence of her thoughts and the perfume of her scent were not the only unusual things about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" I admitted, hating to concede.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, and stared into my eyes for longer than most normal humans were able to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him,\" she explained slowly, her tone growing more forlorn with each word. \"It made her unhappy...so I decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tiny pucker between her eyes deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now you\u0027re unhappy,\" I murmured. I couldn\u0027t seem to stop speaking my hypotheses aloud, hoping to learn from her reactions. This one, however, did not seem as far off the mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" she said, as if this was not even an aspect to be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to stare into her eyes, feeling that I\u0027d finally gotten my first real glimpse into her soul. I saw in that one word where she ranked herself among her own priorities. Unlike most humans, her own needs were far down the list. She was selfless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I saw this, the mystery of the person hiding inside this quiet mind began to thin a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t seem fair,\" I said. I shrugged, trying to seem casual, trying to conceal the intensity of my curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, but there was no amusement the sound. \"Hasn\u0027t anyone ever told you? Life isn\u0027t fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to laugh at her words, though I, too, felt no real amusement. I knew a little something about the unfairness of life. \"I believe I have heard that somewhere before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared back at me, seeming confused again. Her eyes flickered away, and then came back to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s all,\" she told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was not ready to let this conversation end. The little V between her eyes, a remnant of her sorrow, bothered me. I wanted to smooth it away with my fingertip. But, of course, I could not touch her. It was unsafe in so many ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You put on a good show.\" I spoke slowly, still considering this next hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027d be willing to bet that you\u0027re suffering more than you let anyone see.\" She made a face, her eyes narrowing and her mouth twisting into a lopsided pout, and she looked back towards the front of the class. She didn\u0027t like it when I guessed right. She wasn\u0027t the average martyr - she didn\u0027t want an audience to her pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched slightly, but otherwise pretended not to hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made me smile. \"I didn\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does it matter to you?\" she demanded, still staring away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a very good question,\" I admitted, more to myself than to answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer discernment was better than mine - she saw right to the core of things while I floundered around the edges, sifting blindly through clues. The details of her very human life should not matter to me. It was wrong for me to care what she thought. Beyond protecting my family from suspicion, human thoughts were not significant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not used to being the less intuitive of any pairing. I relied on my extra hearing too much - I clearly was not as perceptive as I gave myself credit for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl sighed and glowered toward the front of the classroom. Something about her frustrated expression was humorous. The whole situation, the whole conversation was humorous. No one had ever been in more danger from me than this little girl - at any moment I might, distracted by my ridiculous absorption in the conversation, inhale through my nose and attack her before I could stop myself - and she was irritated because I hadn\u0027t answered her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I annoying you?\" I asked, smiling at the absurdity of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at me quickly, and then her eyes seemed to get trapped by my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly,\" she told me. \"I\u0027m more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read - my mother always calls me her open book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, disgruntled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her in amazement. The reason she was upset was because she thought I saw through her too easily. How bizarre. I\u0027d never expended so much effort to understand someone in all my life - or rather existence, as life was hardly the right word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not truly have a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary,\" I disagreed, feeling strangely...wary, as if there were some hidden danger here that I was failing to see. I was suddenly on edge, the premonition making me anxious. \"I find you very difficult to read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be a good reader then,\" she guessed, making her own assumption that was, again, right on target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at her widely then, letting my lips pull back to expose the rows of gleaming, razor sharp teeth behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a stupid thing to do, but I was abruptly, unexpectedly desperate to get some kind of warning through to the girl. Her body was closer to me than before, having shifted unconsciously in the course of our conversation. All the little markers and signs that were sufficient to scare off the rest of humanity did not seem to be working on her. Why did she not cringe away from me in terror? Surely she had seen enough of my darker side to realize the danger, intuitive as she seemed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t get to see if my warning had the intended effect. Mr. Banner called for the class\u0027s attention just then, and she turned away from me at once. She seemed a little relieved for the interruption, so maybe she understood unconsciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized the fascination growing inside me, even as I tried to root it out. I could not afford to find Bella Swan interesting. Or rather, she could not afford that. Already, I was anxious for another chance to talk to her. I wanted to know more about her mother, her life before she came here, her relationship with her father. All the meaningless details that would flesh out her character further. But every second I spent with her was a mistake, a risk she shouldn\u0027t have to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsentmindedly, she tossed her thick hair just at the moment that I allowed myself another breath. A particularly concentrated wave of her scent hit the back of my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the first day - like the wrecking ball. The pain of the burning dryness made me dizzy. I had to grasp the table again to keep myself in my seat. This time I had slightly more control. I didn\u0027t break anything, at least. The monster growled inside me, but took no pleasure in my pain. He was too tightly bound. For the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped breathing altogether, and leaned as far from the girl as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I could not afford to find her fascinating. The more interesting I found her, the more likely it was that I would kill her. I\u0027d already made two minor slips today. Would I make a third, one that was not minor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the bell sounded, I fled from the classroom - probably destroying whatever impression of politeness I\u0027d halfway constructed in the course of the hour. Again, I gasped at the clean, wet air outside like it was a healing attar. I hurried to put as much distance between myself and the girl as was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett waited for me outside the door of our Spanish class. He read my wild expression for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did it go? he wondered warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody died,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that\u0027s something. When I saw Alice ditching there at the end, I thought...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked into the classroom, I saw his memory from just a few moments ago, seen through the open door of his last class: Alice walking briskly and blank-faced across the grounds toward the science building. I felt his remembered urge to get up and join her, and then his decision to stay. If Alice needed his help, she would ask...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes in horror and disgust as I slumped into my seat. \"I hadn\u0027t realized that it was that close. I didn\u0027t think I was going to...I didn\u0027t see that it was that bad,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t, he reassured me. Nobody died, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said through my teeth. \"Not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it will get easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, maybe you kill her. He shrugged. You wouldn\u0027t be the first one to mess up. No one would judge you too harshly. Sometimes a person just smells too good. I\u0027m impressed you\u0027ve lasted this long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not helping, Emmett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was revolted by his acceptance of the idea that I would kill the girl, that this was somehow inevitable. Was it her fault that she smelled so good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know when it happened to me..., he reminisced, taking me back with him half a century, to a country lane at dusk, where a middle-aged women was taking her dried sheets down from a line strung between apple trees. The scent of apples hung heavy in the air - the harvest was over and the rejected fruits were scattered on the ground, the bruises in their skin leaking their fragrance out in thick clouds. A fresh-mowed field of hay was a background to that scent, a harmony. He walked up the lane, all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2/page-2.html","bookId":2027,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM"}
