Even though I was informed that Bale is coming after me because I tattled on him. Let\u0027s get going to Nathan\u0027s Bay.\" She reached for her bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam put his hands up and stopped her. \"Not so fast.\" There was no way he could put a positive spin on the situation, so he was blunt with his announcement. \"Phillips wants you at the cyber unit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shouldn\u0027t take long.\" He managed a smile. Nothing with Phillips was quick. To her credit she took the news in stride. He came to that conclusion when she didn\u0027t start crying. She also didn\u0027t move. \"I guess you could try to hide,\" he suggested with a straight face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison thought he was serious and shook her head. \"No, he\u0027ll make a ruckus if I don\u0027t go in right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ruckus?\" He put his arms around her and gave her a quick hug. \"I like that word. Want to make a ruckus in the bedroom?\" he asked with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she did. \"Absolutely not.\" Her voice lacked conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door for her. \"Come on. Let\u0027s get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually when Phillips pulled her in on weekends, she took the time to change to her work clothes, but not today. Today she was taking a stand. She was wearing worn-out snug jeans, a cotton shirt, and sneakers. She wasn\u0027t going to change. If he didn\u0027t like her casual attire, too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam left their bags in the apartment and drove her to the office. Rain was coming in. Black clouds rolled overhead as they turned onto the isolated stretch of road, and strong winds battered the tree branches. A clap of thunder shook the car, and Allison flinched. Even though she knew it was illogical, storms frightened her. She wasn\u0027t nervous today, though, because she was with Liam. Nothing much ever fazed him, and that was a comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately they reached the unit and walked inside a scant minute before the downpour. As usual, Phillips was waiting for her outside his office. \"London needs your special talent,\" he told her. \"There\u0027s a small glitch in their system, and they\u0027d like an outsider to look at it.\" Then he turned to Liam. \"I just got a call.\" He gave a tilt of his head in Allison\u0027s direction and said, \"He\u0027s coming in. You might want to talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam nodded. As soon as Phillips went into his office, Liam walked by her side to her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Phillips live here?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No, he lives with his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s married?\" She sounded shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who would marry that man? He\u0027s a classic type A personality, and he\u0027s obsessive-compulsive. He\u0027s-\" She suddenly stopped. Wait a minute. She had just described herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve met her. She\u0027s nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExasperated, he said, \"Phillips\u0027s wife. They\u0027ve been married a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know why their marriage works. He\u0027s never home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the chair out for her, and as he turned to leave, she said, \"I heard Phillips tell you someone is coming in. Who is it? Is it Bale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her. He simply walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re becoming as rude as Phillips,\" she called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously didn\u0027t understand she was trying to be insulting or he wouldn\u0027t have laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little glitch turned out to be a whopper, and it took her the entire day to straighten it out. She also found and removed two bugs. Her hope of spending a relaxing weekend on Nathan\u0027s Bay had been crushed. Maybe another time, she thought, trying to stay optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed down her station and headed toward Phillips\u0027s office. She didn\u0027t have any idea when she\u0027d be able to leave. She knew he would want her to explain what she\u0027d found in the London office. With an ordinary person that might take twenty minutes, but with Phillips it could take half the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just rounded the corner in the hallway when she came face-to-face with Curtis Bale. He looked surprised; then his expression quickly turned to anger. Allison tried to maneuver around him, but he blocked her path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you did,\" he said, sneering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was shocked at first and then took offense to his accusatory tone. \"Tell me. What did I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made yourself look good. You couldn\u0027t find what Scott and Phillips wanted, so you manufactured it. I had nothing to do with those leaks, and yet you did whatever it took to make me and my department look bad. Tell me, Miss Trent, was this all just a game to you, or did you deliberately set out to destroy me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know you, Mr. Bale. Why would I do that?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-82.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
