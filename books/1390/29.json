So now they change semblance, Gunnar and Sigurd, even as Grimhild had taught them; then Sigurd in the likeness of Gunnar mounts and rides, Gram in his hand, and golden spurs on his heels; then leapt Grani into the fire when he felt the spurs; and a mighty roar arose as the fire burned ever madder, and the earth trembled, and the flames went up even unto the heavens, nor had any dared to ride as he rode, even as it were through the deep mirk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now the fire sank withal, and he leapt from his horse and went into the hall, even as the song says —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The flame flared at its maddest,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Earth’s fields fell a-quaking\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the red flame aloft\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Licked the lowest of heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Few had been fain,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of the rulers of folk,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To ride through that flame,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or athwart it to tread.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then Sigurd smote\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grani with sword,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the flame was slaked\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before the king;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Low lay the flames\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before the fain of fame;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bright gleamed the array\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That Regin erst owned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now when Sigurd had passed through the fire, he came into a certain fair dwelling, and therein sat Brynhild.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She asked, “What man is it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he named himself Gunnar, son of Giuki, and said — “Thou art awarded to me as my wife, by the good will and word of thy father and thy foster-father, and I have ridden through the flame of thy fire, according to thy that thou hast set forth.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wot not clearly,” said she, “how I shall answer thee.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now Sigurd stood upright on the hall floor, and leaning on the hilt of his sword, and he spake to Brynhild —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In reward thereof, shall I pay thee a great dower in gold and goodly things?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She answered in heavy mood from her seat, whereas she sat like unto swan on billow, having a sword in her hand and a helm on her head, and being clad in a byrny, “O Gunnar,” she says, “speak not to me of such things unless thou be the first and best of all men; for then shall thou slay those my wooers, if thou hast heart thereto; I have been in battles with the king of the Greeks, and weapons were stained with red blood, and for such things still I yearn.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He answered, “Yea, certes many great deeds hast thou done; but yet call thou to mind thine oath, concerning the riding through of this fire, wherein thou didst swear that thou wouldst go with the man who should do this deed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So she found that he spoke but the sooth, and she paid heed to his words, and arose, and greeted him meetly, and he abode there three nights, and they lay in one bed together; but he took the sword Gram and laid it betwixt them: then she asked him why he laid it there; and he answered, that in that wise must he needs wed his wife or else get his bane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she took from off her the ring Andvari’s loom, which he had given her aforetime, and gave it to him, but he gave her another ring out of Fafnir’s hoard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thereafter he rode away through the same fire unto his Fellows, and he and Gunnar changed semblances again, and rode unto Hlymdale, and told how it had gone with them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That same day went Brynhild home to her foster-father, and tells him as one whom she trusted, how that there had come a king to her; “And he rode through my flaming fire, and said he was come to woo me, and named himself Gunnar; but I said that such a deed might Sigurd alone have done, with whom I plighted troth on the mountain; and he is my first troth-plight, and my well-beloved.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heimir said that things must needs abide even as now they had now come to pass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Brynhild said, “Aslaug the daughter of me and Sigurd shall be nourished here with thee.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now the kings fare home, but Brynhild goes to her father; Grimhild welcomes the kings meetly, and thanks Sigurd for his fellowship; and withal is a great feast made, and many were the guests thereat; and thither came Budli the King with his daughter Brynhild, and his son Atli, and for many days did the feast endure: and at that feast was Gunnar wedded to Brynhild: but when it was brought to an end, once more has Sigurd memory of all the oaths that he sware unto Brynhild, yet withal he let all things abide in rest and peace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Brynhild and Gunnar sat together in great game and glee, and drank goodly wine.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1417/42510.html","bookId":1390,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:12:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:12:08 AM"}
