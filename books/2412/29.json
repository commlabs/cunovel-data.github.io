It was Angie looking down, guiding hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pity, a goddamn pity, pieces of McVee hadn\u0027t flown all over Barnard Street. His slut of a neighbor had intervened there. Bastard had flown some though, he thought with some satisfaction. Oh yeah, the bastard had done a little fucked-up Superman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken all the willpower he\u0027d had not to yank out his nine from under the windbreaker and put bullets in the son of a bitch and the neighborhood slut where they lay bleeding on the side of the road. But as satisfying as that would\u0027ve been, as right as it would\u0027ve been, it could have cost the rest. And the endgame was in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter if McVee died, and there was always the chance of that. Better yet if there was time and opportunity to take out the boyfriend, just for good measure. And it was a damn shame he had to abort the plans to stake out the pansy-assed brother in front of the house where they grew up-with a vestload of explosives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCowards, a couple of dickless cowards is what they were, hiding out in that house, behind the women\u0027s skirts. Not worth his time, Walken told himself, not worth his trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to load his gear with careful hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d be looking for him now. Let them look. In a couple of hours, they\u0027d know just where to find him. And he\u0027d be where he wanted to be, doing what he\u0027d planned to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he was done, everyone would know Phoebe MacNamara had killed an angel, just as sure as the bullet. And when it was over, it would be fucking over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He turned in his papers and moved out of his apartment. He had two months left on his lease, left a check to cover it.\" At Dave\u0027s bedside, Phoebe went through the checklist. \"He had two credit cards at that time. Neither have shown any activity in these three years. He\u0027s contacted no one, not his best friend, nor his former commanding officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a checking account, and a savings account totaling six thousand and change, and a safety deposit box. He cleaned everything out on the same day he quit the department. There was an oh-one Chevy pickup registered to him. He sold it, for eight thousand cash, to a Derrick Means, in the same apartment building. We\u0027re checking that out, but don\u0027t expect it to go anywhere. Also registered to him were a ninemillimeter Smith and Wesson and a thirty-two Remington semi. His friend knew him to own a hunting rifle, with scope, a thirty-thirty, and a twenty-two pistol which had been his father\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likes guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he does. He\u0027s a trained sniper, and had training in explosives during his time in the army. He also worked with our own bomb squad before he requested and received the transfer to SWAT. He\u0027s somewhere in or around Savannah, but as far as we know, you\u0027re the only one who\u0027s seen him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her hands. \"I don\u0027t know what to do. I negotiate, I don\u0027t investigate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A puzzle\u0027s a puzzle, Phoebe. It\u0027s all pieces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some of them. He blames me for Angela Brentine\u0027s death, maybe because there isn\u0027t anyone else to blame. He was on the team that day, Dave. He was on the incident where she died. His scope trained on the bank, waiting for the go. We didn\u0027t know the names of the hostages, or the injured. He didn\u0027t know she was in there, dead or dying, while he waited outside, while all those hours passed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ineffective. Impotent.\" Dave nodded, then closed his eyes as the slight movement stirred pain in the base of his skull. \"Lancelot didn\u0027t rescue Guinevere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what he can\u0027t live with. That he was there, waiting while she bled out. While I had them wait, while I talked her killers down so they walked out with their hands in the air. They lived, she died, because of decisions I made. That\u0027s what he believes. That\u0027s what he has to believe. But it doesn\u0027t help us find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d he go after Roy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink it through, Phoebe reminded herself. Empathize. \"The connection to me-we had a child together, we were married. Husband a symbol. Harder, much harder, to get to Brentine than to Roy. And Roy was mine. He wants to destroy what\u0027s mine, as I destroyed what was his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just the woman.\" Dave reached for the water glass, then settled back to sip through the straw as Phoebe picked it up, held it to his lips. \"Thanks. Not just the woman,\" he repeated. \"His self-image was destroyed. Didn\u0027t save the day. Followed orders, hung back with the rest instead of walking solo out into the street for the showdown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this time, he is, he will. Moving up the line,\" she mused. \"Roy, then you. Everyone knows we\u0027re close. And that I\u0027m a negotiator because of you. Therefore, I was at the bank because of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to call the nurse?\" she said when he shifted, when she saw pain tighten his face. \"You should rest, you should-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Keep going. It keeps my mind busy. You call the nurse, she\u0027s going to come in here with a needle and take more blood. I swear, being in a hospital\u0027s like being in a den of vampires. They never get enough of your blood. Keep going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWishing she could do more, Phoebe tucked and smoothed his sheets as she spoke. \"All right. The dead animals, to defile my house, to under mine my sense of security. Snake, rabbit, rat. He\u0027s probably based outside the city. Somebody\u0027s going to notice if you shoot a rabbit otherwise. Smarter to have a place outside the city, quiet, secluded. Nobody\u0027s going to bother you or notice you overmuch, not if you keep to yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet along,\" she said. \"Like he got along with his teammates. A house, a bungalow. He\u0027d need transportation. They\u0027re still checking on how he got to Hilton Head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the window. Urban sprawl, she thought, so roads led to suburbs, and suburbs gave way to swamps and woods. Bridges ribboned their way to islands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many places to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every cop in the city, every cop on the islands, has his picture. He has to know that. He has to know you lived, that you saw him, and that we\u0027re looking for him now. I see he\u0027s got two choices-to cut and run, or to finish. He won\u0027t cut and run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to be ready when he comes at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I\u0027m trying to be.\" She turned back. \"I never asked how you felt this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to be alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had to tie the rest of the family down to keep them from coming to see you. And I\u0027m under orders to put you under orders to come to the house when they spring you from here so Mama and Ava can spoil you while you recuperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that include peach pie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can guarantee it. When are you going to ask Ava out on a date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are the two of you going to stop sending wistful glances at each other\u0027s backs? You\u0027re both grown-up, divorced people. I don\u0027t think she got any sleep last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how many times this morning she asked me about you, or argued with me about coming to see you herself, or told me to tell you she was thinking of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a friend, she\u0027s been a friend a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dave, my mama is your friend.\" Exasperation eked through enough to have her fisting her hands on her hips. \"Are you going to lie there on what might have been your deathbed and tell me you feel the same about Ava you do about my mama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" She approached the bed again. \"I know how to find out what people want in emotional and stressful situations. If you\u0027re too flustered to tell me-and it\u0027s awful cute to see you blushI\u0027ll tell you. You want to ask Ava out for a romantic, candlelight dinner when you\u0027re back on your feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stirred again, but this time Phoebe could see it wasn\u0027t about pain. \"It happens I was thinking about her-about that-when I was walking home yesterday. Before. I was thinking the timing for doing that was lousy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timing\u0027s lousy on most everything half the time.\" Smiling down at him, she brushed at his hair. \"I asked Duncan to marry me. He said yes.\" Dave\u0027s mouth opened and closed. \"You\u0027re full of surprises this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I surprise myself. I love him like I\u0027ve been waiting to find him my whole life, just waiting for the rest of my life to start. You\u0027ll give me away again, won\u0027t you? I\u0027m betting this one sticks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m betting it will, too.\" Reaching up, he gripped her hand. \"I\u0027m happy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I. You\u0027ve been waiting, Dave, an awfully long time. Ask Ava out to dinner, so the rest of your life starts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Phoebe walked out of Dave\u0027s room, Liz pushed off the wall. \"Thanks for giving me some alone time with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. How\u0027s he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well enough to settle my nerves on that score. I want to thank you again for pairing up with me today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another no problem. This Walken tried to kill one of our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere isn\u0027t anyone in the department who isn\u0027t invested in this. He can\u0027t hide for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s not going to run.\" She stepped outside into the swampy heat. \"That storm didn\u0027t cool it off any. Just made it wetter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer in Savannah. Love it or go away. Go ahead and take it,\" she said when Phoebe\u0027s phone rang. \"I\u0027ll drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s him.\" She held out the phone so Liz could read the display. With a nod, Liz stepped away, drew her own phone. \"Phoebe MacNamara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Dave doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing well, thanks. You screwed up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Variables, Phoebe. You know about variables. Shit happens. I know you\u0027re looking for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sound upset by that, Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not. You won\u0027t find me until I\u0027m ready. You wearing a vest, Phoebe?\" As her heart jumped, she shoved Liz down behind the cover of the car. \"It\u0027s too damned hot for a vest, Jerry. How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I could\u0027ve put one in the back of your head, and the brunette\u0027s. But I\u0027ve got other plans. We\u0027ll be talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was here,\" Phoebe said. \"Watched us go in or watched us come out. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s here now.\" Could\u0027ve, not could, she thought. She looked down, saw her weapon was in her hand. The hand was shaking, but it held. \"Back of the head. Going in. He\u0027s not here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her phone rang a second time, her heart stuck in her throat. \"It\u0027s Sykes,\" she told Liz. \"What have you got?\" she asked him. \"Airport Budget rented a Toyota to a Grimes, Samuel, last Thursday. It was dropped off in Hilton Head Saturday afternoon. I\u0027m looking at a copy of the driver\u0027s license. It\u0027s Walken. Darker hair, glasses, but it\u0027s him. Used a Visa. The license lists an address in Montana, but the credit card\u0027s got billing going to one on Tybee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the one. Relay the situation and the address to Commander Harrison. Liz and I\u0027ll join the team there.\" She climbed into the car. \"What\u0027s the address?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa Bee smiled a smug smile as she shifted the kitchen phone to her right ear. \"Does this mean I\u0027m finally going to get me some white grandbabies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically, you\u0027ll start off with one who\u0027s already seven. Then we\u0027ll see what we can do. How about helping me out on the sparkler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love shiny things, and my taste is world-renowned. I guess I could give you the benefit of my renowned taste in shiny things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today? I\u0027ve got a couple of things, then I could swing out and pick you up, then we\u0027ll swing back in and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I have myself a fine car sitting right out in the driveway? I can get myself where I\u0027m going. So where am I going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured if I didn\u0027t find it at Mark D\u0027s on Abercorn, I\u0027m not going to find it anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark D\u0027s?\" She let out a long whistle. \"That\u0027s the high-dollar mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got high dollars. And it happens I made a call, and Mr. D himself would be pleased to meet us and show us some of his more exclusive designs.\" Now she hooted. \"Aren\u0027t you the one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is. I was thinking maybe I could find something for Carly. And there I\u0027m out of my depth. Something that\u0027d suit a little girl, but would maybe move on up with her. I figured it being a package deal, I could... you know, make it a package.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to be a fine daddy. What time do you want me to meet you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can get there around noon. Buy you lunch after if you do a good job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there. You bring those high dollars, boy, \u0027cause I\u0027m itching to spend them for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up, literally rubbed her hands together. A glance at the clock told her she had time to spread the word before fixing herself up for a trip to Mark D\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tactical team was already in place and moving in when Phoebe arrived. It was a good location, she thought with a look around. Well off the beach, older house, a little run-down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second time that day, she drew her weapon as the team broke in the front door with a small battering ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No car,\" Harrison commented. \"No bike, no scooter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No Walken. He\u0027s not here, but now he\u0027s got no place to come back to.\" She waited, blood pumping, for the all clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant.\" Sykes jogged over. \"DMV came through. He\u0027s got an oh-six Escalade. Got the tag number. APB\u0027s going out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do good work, Detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re clear,\" Harrison announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d likely rented it furnished, Phoebe decided. The furniture was old, cheap but serviceable. He kept it tidy, she noted. No clutter, no fuss. The bed was made with military precision, and on the table beside it stood a framed photo of Angela Brentine and a single pink rose. Thought of himself as a soldier and a romantic, she concluded as she took notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Second bedroom\u0027s locked,\" Harrison told her. \"Window\u0027s covered. They\u0027re checking for booby traps before they take it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spartan, wouldn\u0027t you say? Military neatness. The bare bones of a field HQ. We should talk to the landlord, anyone in the houses and cottages round about.\" She moved to the closet. \"His clothes are still here, neatly hung.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toothbrush, shaving cream, basic toiletries in the bath,\" Harrison told her. His face was hard, his eyes somber as they met hers. \"He isn\u0027t running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She heard the crash of the second door going down. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant?\" A member of the tactical team came to the doorway. \"I think you\u0027ll want to see this. Found his nest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she walked across the hall, her blood went cold. Photographs papered an entire wall. Her face, over and over, in every possible expression. Photos of her standing in front of her house, talking with Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiffany, walking with Carly in the park, standing with her mother on the veranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole family on what had to have been St. Patrick\u0027s Day. One of her moving into Duncan\u0027s arms the night they\u0027d had dinner on his boat. Her sitting on the bench, like Forrest Gump, in Chippewa Park, alone, then with Marvella. Of her shopping, eating, driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shudder ran through her before she looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room was a large head-and-shoulders shot of Angela, with candles and bud vases of pink roses crowded on the table below it. She studied the workbench, a long table, shelves. On them, meticulously arranged, were a laptop computer, a police scanner, chemicals, wires, what she thought must be timing mechanisms, tape, rope and tools. She spotted the shotgun, the rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He took his handguns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a couple of wigs, glasses, false beards, makeup, face putty,\" Liz said as she crossed over. \"No journal. Maybe on that,\" she said with a nod toward the laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t he take it? Why didn\u0027t he take what was important to him?\" Because it shook her down to the bone, Phoebe kept her back to the wall of photos. \"Switch locations at least. He knows we have his name, his photo, and someone\u0027s going to point us here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t have been sure we\u0027d ID\u0027d him until he talked to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He stays a step ahead. Why is he suddenly a step behind? Expensive equipment, easily portable, just left here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up a camera, turned it over, saw the painted pink rosebud. Angela\u0027s camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He planned to come back for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, Phoebe set the camera back down. \"I don\u0027t think so. I think he\u0027s done here, and that we\u0027re exactly where he wants us to be. But where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped to another wall, covered with photos of Savannah. Banks, shops, restaurants, museums, exterior, interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t waste anything. Everything has a purpose, even if it\u0027s thumbing his nose. So why does he take these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where are the others?\" Liz wondered. \"He\u0027s taken some down-you can see where he had other shots up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he took them with him, he needed them. He takes pictures of places because the places have a purpose, or the potential of one. Targets. These are digital shots, aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to the laptop. \"We have to get in there, find the files, find the ones he took with him. That\u0027s the target.\" As it churned, she pressed a hand to her stomach. \"I think he gave himself the go, the green light. Today. I think it has to be today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her watch and felt the chill as she noted it was ten fifty-five. \". We\u0027ve got an hour to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shoved his hands in his pockets, jiggled loose change while the structural engineers, the architect and Jake swarmed over the warehouse. \"We have to move this along, Phin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You set the meeting, the inspection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that was before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think Ma\u0027s going to mind poking around a jewelry store on her own awhile if you\u0027re running late, you\u0027ve forgotten who you\u0027re dealing with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan pulled his hand out of his pocket to check his watch. Eleven-ten. \"Maybe I should call her, tell her to make it twelve-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s probably on her way, especially since she\u0027s meeting Loo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhin grinned at Duncan\u0027s blank look. \"If you don\u0027t think Ma got on the horn and starting blowing the news the minute she hung up with you, you\u0027re not thinking, boy. Then again, I guess a man about to buy an engagement ring\u0027s not thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Working out pretty well for me, too.\" He gave Duncan a slap on the back. \"Business, Dune. Ma and Loo can entertain each other just fine if you\u0027re late. Loo said she was taking a full hour lunch, and was prepared to make it two if need be. So God help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe paced outside the computer lab. One step ahead, she thought. He was still one step ahead. \"Somewhere that means something to him, in association with her. It\u0027s more personal than something associated with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer family was safe, she reminded herself. Inside, guarded and safe. Hadn\u0027t she checked twenty minutes ago? Hadn\u0027t she talked to Carly, to her mother, even contacted the cops on duty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bank where she was killed is under heavy surveillance. If he tries to get in, we\u0027ll have him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over at Liz, nodded. \"And he\u0027d know that. Still, if that was his target, that wouldn\u0027t stop him. He\u0027d assume he\u0027s far enough ahead of us to hit it before we\u0027re in place. But it\u0027s the obvious target, and that concerns me. I think it\u0027s somewhere else. A restaurant where they met, a hotel, motel, even one of the parks. It needs to be a statement, Liz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePacing, she tried to find the pieces. \"Blowing up a man in Bonaventure, that\u0027s a statement. Attempting to do the same to a police captain mere blocks from the station, that\u0027s another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big, splashy. I get that. And this is the biggest, the splashiest.\" Like Phoebe, Liz stared through the glass walls of the lab. \"I get that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"City Hall, courthouse, the station itself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All on alert. But if it\u0027s personal, the way you\u0027re thinking, those don\u0027t fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. You\u0027re right. He can\u0027t get to Brentine, and Brentine isn\u0027t his issue, either. She was leaving him, Brentine\u0027s superfluous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security\u0027s stepped up at his home and office in any case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long is it going to take them to find those files? Even with him deleting them the way he did, they\u0027re still there somewhere. That\u0027s what they always say. Damn it, we\u0027ve only got twenty minutes till noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten to twelve, Ma Bee and Loo strolled into Mark D\u0027s, anticipating an afternoon of shopping and a celebration lunch. Ma had donned her shopping shoes and a breezy purple dress. She had put on her goingoutspecial lipstick, and had spritzed on some of her favorite French perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could\u0027ve handled this expedition, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoo gave a snort. \"You think I\u0027m letting you have all the fun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve done this before with all your boys. But it\u0027s my first chance to have some input on an engagement ring. Don\u0027t you love this place?\" She gave Ma a little elbow bump as they stopped to look around. \"All these glitters, and everything all hushed and reverent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they can charge more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, but that little black-and-silver box from Mark D\u0027s? That says something. When Phineas gave me that bracelet from here last Christmas, I squealed like a girl. And he got awfully lucky that night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Ma\u0027s turn to snort. \"I don\u0027t see a new grandchild for me coming out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think faster. I\u0027m not getting any younger.\" She looked up at the trio of crystal chandeliers. \"But you\u0027re right, it sure is fine in here. Let\u0027s have a little look-see before Duncan gets here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie Meeks was bored out of his mind. He was, in his opinion, nothing more than a glorified doorman, standing around while tourists and rich Savannahians came breezing inside. The tourists were a pain in the ass, mostly, just coming in to gawk. And the rich-bitches mostlyhad their noses in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike they didn\u0027t squat to pee like the rest of their kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man could fix this. Resentment bubbled up inside his throat at the thought of it. Push the buttons, pull the strings, grease the palms, he\u0027d be back on the job instead of standing around waiting to roust shoplifters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the weeks since he\u0027d been stuck on this humiliating duty, he\u0027d had only a little action in that area twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he needed was for some asshole to come in and try to rob the place. Now that would be a fucking dream come true. He\u0027d take the bastard down, you could bet your ass on it. Take him down, be a hero. Get on TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet back on the job where he goddamn belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the two black women come in and curled his lip. As if that old lady in her thick-soled shoes could afford so much as a cuff link from this place. The young one was hot-if you went for the Halle Berry type-and had a slick look about her. So maybe she could dig out a platinum card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably just more lookie-loos, Arnie decided as he watched them gawk around. The way he saw it, more than half the people who came in the doors were lookie-loos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did his own scan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen people wandered around the store, drooling over the displays. Three clerks-who made more than he did with their fucking commissions by kissing ass and talking people into buying what they didn\u0027t need-manned counters or unlocked cabinets to take something out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was manned with security cameras, with alarms. Even the back room, where he knew the man himself was planted today, in anticipation of some deep-pocketed client. Arnie had heard the buzz on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Pockets would be escorted into the back, so the hoi polloi couldn\u0027t watch him playing with the sparklers. Or if he wanted to be seen-and some of them got off on that-they\u0027d set him up at the special table in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatsy, the blonde with the rack, had told him that Julia Roberts had shopped there in the back room. And Tom Hanks had, too. At the special table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he\u0027d move on Patsy, get a little action there. His marriage was in the toilet, and the way things were going with Mayleen-thanks to that bitch MacNamara-he wasn\u0027t getting anything there either. Time to scout the field again, pick himself a new heifer out of the herd. He knew by the way she looked at him-the way she made sure her ass wiggled when she walked away-that Patsy was up for it. Maybe he\u0027d take her for a little spin some night after work. See how she handled in the sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over as the front door gave its little ding as it opened. He saw the brown uniform and cursed under his breath. A pain-in-the-ass delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoo pulled out her cell phone when it played \"Jailhouse Rock.\" She winked at Ma when she read the display. \"Hey there, lover-boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, gorgeous. You there with Ma?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re here admiring a whole buncha diamond rings. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Running behind. On my way, though, with this leech on me I can\u0027t pull off. He insists on coming along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That leech about six feet tall with eyes like melted dark chocolate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s about that tall, anyway. We\u0027re just heading cross town. Probably take a good fifteen minutes yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time, and tell that brown-eyed man I\u0027ve got my own eyes on a pair of ruby earrings that are going to set him back a bit. Another fifteen, twenty minutes, I bet I find something else to set him back even more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll take my time. Why should I be the only one spending money today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time was clicking down toward noon when Phoebe was able to see the photos. She hung over the shoulder of the computer technician. \"Some of these were on the wall. Prints were left on the wall. Some of them weren\u0027t. This motel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over by Oglethorpe Mall,\" the technician told her. \"You see he\u0027s got shots of the outside, the lobby and this room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They used that room for trysts when it wasn\u0027t convenient to use his apartment. And this restaurant-I know this place, little Italian place. That\u0027s out by the mall, too. Not in the heart of things, not places they\u0027d likely run into anyone in her husband\u0027s circle. But they don\u0027t feel like the sort of places he\u0027d target. They\u0027re not what you\u0027d call important, like Bonaventure. Not a statement like- Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped the tech\u0027s shoulder as he panned through the file. \"Wait, that\u0027s Mark D\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside and out, back and front. I don\u0027t think they allow photographs inside Mark D\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, security, insurance. No, they wouldn\u0027t want photographs. Pictures of the back door, the front door from inside and out.\" In her belly, muscles tightened. \"I want cars over there now. Right now. Liz, get ahold of Property, find out what jewelry was listed in her personal effects. And, Jesus, let\u0027s get his credit card records for three months back from Angela\u0027s death. Good work,\" she said to the technician. \"Let\u0027s get the hell over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix minutes, she noted as she rushed out. Six minutes until noon. Maybe they weren\u0027t too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, buddy, when are you guys going to get the word that deliveries are supposed to come in first thing in the morning, before the customers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just following orders.\" He rolled in the dolly with its three large boxes. He turned deliberately into Arnie. \"Just like you\u0027re going to do, unless you want to take a bullet in the belly. Lock the door, asshole,\" he ordered as he clamped a hand over Arnie\u0027s weapon. \"I\u0027ve got an S-and-W nine shoved right into your navel. The bullet\u0027s going to make a hell of a hole out the other side of you, if you don\u0027t do now and think later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck do you... I know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I used to be a cop, too. Let\u0027s do it this way.\" Lifting the gun, he whipped it across Arnie\u0027s face and sent him down. Even before the first scream, he was turning, both weapons in his hands. And he smiled as, right on schedule, right according to plan, some good employee hit the alarms that set them shrilling. And locked the place down. \"Everybody on the floor. Now! Now!\" He put a series of rounds in the ceiling, shattering crystal. There was plenty of screaming as people dove for cover or simply dropped to huddle together on the floor. \"Except you, Blondie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe aimed the nine at Patsy. \"Over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Die there or come here. Five seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith tears already streaming out of her eyes, she stumbled toward him. He hooked one arm around her neck, put the gun to her temple. \"Want to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. God. Oh God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone in the back? Lie to me, and I\u0027ll know, and I\u0027ll kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... Mr. D.\" She sobbed it out. \"Mr. D\u0027s in the back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got monitors back there, right? He can see us right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d better call out, Blondie. Because if he isn\u0027t out here in ten seconds, he\u0027s going to lose his first employee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need.\" Mark stepped out of the back room, hands high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a small-framed man in his early sixties, with a dapper white mustache and a head of waving white hair. \"There\u0027s no need to hurt her. No need to hurt anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll be up to you, for a start. Over here, cuff your boy, hands behind his back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be dead, you don\u0027t get it done. I want everyone to empty their pockets-one at a time-starting with you.\" He kicked the shoulder of a man in a Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts. \"Everything out, turn the pockets inside out. Anyone reaches for a cell phone, a weapon, a fucking stick of gum, I shoot. What\u0027s your name, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patsy. It\u0027s Patsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute. I shoot cute Patsy in the ear. Pockets, now,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He needs medical attention,\" Mark said as he knelt beside Arnie. \"I\u0027ll unlock the cases. You can take whatever you want. The police are on the way. The alarm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s handy.\" He heard the sirens already, cutting through the high ring of the store alarm. Quicker than he\u0027d thought, but that was fine. \"You\u0027re going to turn off the alarm, Mark, but you\u0027re not going to abort the lockdown. You got that? Screw it up, and Patsy\u0027s brains are going to be all over your nice, shiny floor. You.\" He kicked the first man again. \"Up. Roll that dolly to the northeast corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I... I don\u0027t know which is the northeast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalken rolled his eyes. \"Right rear, fuckhead. Move! You, you, drag that worthless dick back there with it.\" He back-walked with Patsy, then shoved her to her knees. \"Get some shopping bags, Patsy. You\u0027re going to pick up all this junk people carried in here, put it in shopping bags and put the bags on this counter. Everybody else, facedown. Oh, not you, Mark, sorry. Northeast corner. I\u0027m watching you, Patsy. You be good, now. Pick up the phone, Mark.\" He nodded toward the one on the desk. \"Call nine-one-one. You\u0027re going to say exactly what I tell you to say. Nothing more, nothing less. Understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Walken tucked Arnie\u0027s weapon in his belt, ripped open the top box on the dolly. \"You see what\u0027s in here, Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s white face went gray as he looked in the box. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenty more where that came from. Make the call.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-29.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
