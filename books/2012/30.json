Webbing from the harnesses of leather armour, the strips stained black. ‘Nothing to pull in it, sir, that I can see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was thinking me, marine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, I can—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan picked up the spit and waved it about. ‘A joke, soldier. Ha ha. Here, this thing looks ready. Cooking is the process of making the familiar unrecognizable, and thus palatable. When intelligence was first born, the first question asked was, “Can this thing be cooked?” After all, try eating a cow’s face – well, true enough, people do – oh, never mind. You must be hungry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle made his way over. Ruthan plucked the bird from the skewer and then tore it in half, handing one section to the marine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate without conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, sucking and spitting out the last bone, licking grease from his fingers, Bottle sighed and eyed the man opposite him. ‘I saw you go down, sir, under about a hundred Short-Tails.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan raked his beard. ‘Aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle glanced away, tried again. ‘Figured you were dead.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Couldn’t get through the armour, but I’m still a mass of bruises. Anyway, they pounded me into the ground for a while and then just, well, gave up.’ He grimaced. ‘Took me some time to dig free. By then, apart from the dead they were collecting, there was no sign of the Bonehunters, or our allies. The Khundryl looked finished – never saw so many dead horses. And the trenches had been overrun. The Letherii had delivered and taken some damage, but hard to guess the extent of either.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think I saw some of that,’ Bottle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I sniffed you out, though,’ the captain said, not meeting Bottle’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I just did. You were barely there, but enough. So I pulled you free.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And they just watched.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did they? Never noticed that.’ He wiped his hands on his thighs and rose. ‘Ready to walk then, soldier?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think so. Where are we going, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To find the ones still left.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When was the battle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Four, five days ago, something like that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir, are you a Stormrider?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A rogue wave?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle’s frown deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Another joke,’ said Ruthan Gudd. ‘Let’s strip what’s on the travois – found you a sword, a few other things you might find useful.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It was all a mistake, wasn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shot him a look. ‘Everything is, soldier, sooner or later.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos foamed in a thrashing maelstrom far below. He stood close to the ledge, looking down. Off to his right the rock tilted, marking the end of the vaguely level base of the pinnacle, and at the far end the Spar, a gnarled thing of black stabbing upward like a giant finger, seemed to cast a penumbra of white mist from its ragged tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, he turned away, crossed the flat stretch, twelve paces to a sheer wall of rock, and to the mouth of a tunnel where shattered boulders had spilled out to the sides. He clambered over the nearest heap until he found a dusty oilskin cape jammed inside a crevasse. Tugging it aside, he reached down and withdrew a tattered satchel. It was so rotted the base began splitting at the seams and he scrambled quickly to flat ground before the contents spilled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoins pattered, baubles struck and clattered. Two larger items, both wrapped in skins and each the length of a man’s forearm, struck the bedrock but made no sound. These objects were the only ones he collected, tucking one into his belt and unwrapping the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sceptre of plain black wood, its ends capped in tarnished silver. He examined it for a moment, and then strode to the base of the Spar of Andii. Rummaging in the pouch at his hip, he withdrew a knotted clutch of horse hair, dropped it at his feet, and then with a broad sweeping motion used the sceptre to inscribe a circle above the black stone. Then he stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment his breath caught and he half turned. When he spoke his tone was apologetic. ‘Ah, Mother, it’s old blood, I don’t deny it. Old and thin.’ He hesitated, and then said, ‘Tell Father I make no apologies for my choice – why should I? No matter. The two of us did the best I could.’ He grunted in humour. ‘And you might say the same thing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness was knotting into something solid before him. He watched it for a time, saying nothing, although her presence was palpable, vast in the gloom behind him. ‘If he’d wanted blind obedience, he should have kept me chained. And you, Mother, you should have kept me a child for ever, there under your wing.’ He sighed, somewhat shakily. ‘We’re still here, but then, we did what you both wanted. We almost got them all. The one thing none of us expected was how it would change us.’ He glanced back again, momentarily. ‘And it has.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-30.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
