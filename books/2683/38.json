Two of his aides have the front booth. He should look middle-aged but with the not-too-recent facelift and since according to my sister he\u0027s been on Prozac since April (a secret), everything is vaguely cool. For relaxation: hunting deer, an astrologer to deal with those planetary vibes, squash. And his nutritionist has stressed raw fish, brown rice, no tempura but hijiki is okay and I\u0027m basically here for some toro sashimi, some jokey conversation and a charming inquiry about some cash. He smiles, bright caps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Dad, I got lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look thin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all those drugs, Dad,\" I sigh, sliding into the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not funny, Victor,\" he says wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, I don\u0027t do drugs.

Things are happening. I\u0027m in control of all the elements. You are laughing somewhat jaggedly, Dad, but I am in continuous flux.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m staking out new territory, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare straight ahead. \"The future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad stares glumly back, gives up, looks around, smiles awkwardly. \"You\u0027ve become much more skillful, Victor, at expressing, um, your ambitions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet, Dad. I\u0027m streamlined and direct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful.\" He motions to Evett, the waiter, for more iced tea. \"So where are you coming from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a photo shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you\u0027re not doing any more of those naked Webster shots or whatever. Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Near naked. Bruce Weber. I\u0027m not trying to freak you out, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wagging your ass around like-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an Obsession ad, Dad. You\u0027re acting like it was some kind of\u0026nbsp; p**n o movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your point, Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, the point is: the-column-blocked-my-crotch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s already flipping through his menu. \"Before I forget, thank you for the, um, Patti Lupone CD you sent me for my birthday, Victor. It was a thoughtful gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the menu too. \"No sweat, dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad keeps glancing uneasily over at the MTV table, some of the executives probably making wisecracks. I resist waving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad asks, \"Why are they staring over here like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe because you have `lost white guy\u0027 written all over you?\" I ask. \"Christ, I need a glass of bottled water. Or a dry beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvett comes over with the iced tea and silently takes our order, then moves uncertainly toward the back of the restaurant. \"Nice-looking girl,\" my dad says, admiringly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-38.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
