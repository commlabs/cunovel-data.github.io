His father said a seven-year-old who slept on a pallet next to his mother\u0027s bed would never be a great warrior and had forbidden it. But his father was away, and Connor had been afraid something bad would happen to his mother if he did not stay close to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May your sons already born by other women die young,\" his mother said as she raked her stick around the fire again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been weeping and tearing at her hair for days. She was like that sometimes. Other times, she was like sunshine that was so bright it hurt your eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had never done this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three times \u0027round, and the spell is bound.\" His mother straightened and raised her stick in the air. \"And may ye know it was I, your wife, who cursed you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor heard running feet coming through the darkness just before a familiar voice called, \"No, Catriona!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor\u0027s heart lifted when Duncan\u0027s mother, Anna, appeared. Her soft voice and kind words could sometimes soothe his mother. But if Anna saw him, she would send him back to the castle. Before she noticed him, Connor crawled through the beach grass until he was safely out of the firelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, ye mustn\u0027t do this,\" Anna said. \"An evil spell that\u0027s unwarranted can come back on ye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Donald Gallach deserves every evil wish,\" his mother spat out. \"With passion and sweet promises of eternal love, he persuaded me to leave a man who adored me. And now, I discover he\u0027s been keeping a woman up at Trotternish Castle - and she\u0027s borne him a son!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men have done far worse.\" Anna put her arm around his mother\u0027s shoulders. \"I beg ye, take back this curse before it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was too late the moment he took another woman to his bed,\" his mother said and pushed Anna away. \"I swear I will make that man regret what he\u0027s done to me for the rest of his days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain you\u0027re the only one the chieftain loves,\" Anna said, brushing his mother\u0027s wild tangles back from her face. \"Please, return to the castle and rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he believes I will accept this and remain here, a dutiful wife, he has forgotten who I am.\" His mother stared into the fire and smiled in a way that frightened Connor. \"How he will rage when I leave him for another man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye can\u0027t mean to do that,\" Anna said. \"What about your children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor held his breath, trying not to cry, as he waited for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye know very well that Highland children - especially a chieftain\u0027s children - belong to their father,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they need their mother,\" Anna said, gripping her arm again. \"And young Connor adores ye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re better at mothering them than I am, and I know you\u0027d never let Donald Gallach touch you,\" his mother said. \"Promise you\u0027ll take care of Connor and Moira after I leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go!\" Connor ran to his mother and buried his face in her skirts. As always, she smelled of rose petals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sweet, serious lad.\" His mother dropped to her knee and embraced him, then she leaned back and asked, \"Ye want your mother to be happy, don\u0027t ye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor nodded. If she were happy, she would stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were begat of fiery passion, when I owned your father\u0027s heart,\" she said, holding his face between her hands. \"Every time your father looks at you, he will remember how it was between us and regret what he\u0027s lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, Connor slept too soundly, and his mother disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he awoke, a storm raged outside, and the castle was in an uproar. His father had returned after weeks away and was bellowing at everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye follow your mother about like a dog.\" His father lifted Connor off his feet, shook him, and shouted in his face. \"Ye must have seen her with someone. Who did she leave with? Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father\u0027s fingers dug into his arms, but Connor did not say a word. Even if he had known where his mother was, he would never betray her. And if he was very good, she might come back for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father sent his galleys in every direction, despite the storm. By the next day, an eerie calm had settled over the sea. Connor was outside with Ragnall, his father\u0027s son by his first wife, when one of the galleys returned. As soon as he saw a warrior carrying his mother from the boat, her limbs and long black hair swaying with his long strides, Connor started running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Connor!\" Ragnall shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe darted out of his brother\u0027s reach and scrambled down to the beach. But Ragnall was ten years older, a grown man, and he caught Connor before he reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRagnall neither chastised nor tried to soothe him, but simply held Connor against his solid frame, heavily muscled from constant training. Connor strained to see his mother through the warriors who had crowded around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even in death, she commands the attention of every man,\" Ragnall said under his breath. \"By the saints, your mother was beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas? Connor did not understand, but fear knotted his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men suddenly parted to let the chieftain through. As their father brushed past Connor and Ragnall, his gaze was fixed on the limp body that was draped over the warrior\u0027s arms like an offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their galley capsized in the storm, and all were lost,\" the warrior said when his father came to a halt before him. \"A farmer found her body washed up on shore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscles of his father\u0027s jaw clenched and unclenched as his gaze traveled over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see her!\" Connor wailed, reaching his arms out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father pivoted and fixed his fierce golden eyes on him. Ragnall tightened his grip and turned sideways to protect him from their father\u0027s wrath, but Connor was too distraught to fear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with her?\" Connor usually kept silent in his father\u0027s presence, but he had to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was unfaithful, and now she\u0027s dead,\" his father said, anger vibrating off him. \"There will be no weeping for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrief sucked the air from Connor\u0027s lungs, and it was a long moment before any sound came out. Then he howled, \"No!\" and clawed at his brother\u0027s arms. \"Let me see her! Let me see her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Praise God I have one son who is a fit heir to lead this great clan,\" his father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor\u0027s only a bairn, Fa - \" Ragnall started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chieftain cut him off with an abrupt wave of his hand. \"Keep her son out of my sight.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-chieftain-return-of-the-highlanders-4/page-1.html","bookId":2647,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:09 AM"}
