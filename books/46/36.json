After weeks of torment, the prisoner was sure that there was no hope, that no one knew or cared. But in the middle of the night, the door of the cell opened, and the jailer, shouting abuse into the darkness, threw a loaf of bread onto the dirt floor. The prisoner, by this time ravenous, tore open the loaf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Inside was a matchbox. Inside the matchbox were matches and a scrap of paper. The prisoner lit a match. On the paper was a single word: \"Coraggio!\" Courage. Take courage. Don\u0027t give up, don\u0027t give in. We are trying to help you. \"Coraggio!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The prisoner never did find out who wrote the one-word message, but the spark of hope it provided may well have saved his life. The story is told in Matchbox, the newspaper of Amnesty International U.S.A., one of the largest branches of the worldwide human rights organization that received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1977.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e David Hawk, executive director of Amnesty international U.S.A., sits behind his desk on a weekday morning talking about how the group originated and what it has done to earn the prize.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was started in Britain in 1961 by a lawyer named Peter Benenson,\" says Hawk, whose name belies the fact that he has been involved in civil rights for nearly half of his 34 years. \"It started over a trial that was going on in Portugal.\" Benenson launched a one-year campaign to call attention to the Portuguese prisoners.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon the idea became so popular that a permanent organization was created. Chapters sprang up in other countries, and members began to work toward freeing \"prisoners of conscience\" on every continent. In the past 17 years, Amnesty International — or \"Amnesty\" for short — has aided in securing the release of nearly 13,000 individuals who were imprisoned not for crimes, but for personal beliefs that went against their governments\u0027 official policies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re a nuisance factor,\" says Hawk. \"We organize letter-writing and publicity campaigns on behalf of individual victims of human rights violations. It\u0027s the letters and the publicity that are Amnesty\u0027s tools for securing their release or bettering their conditions while they\u0027re in. At first it sounds strange to think that people sitting in living rooms in the United States can help someone in a fortress prison on an island in Indonesia, or in Siberia. … You deluge certain people with so many letters that eventually it becomes an issue. Then the government asks, \u0027Is holding this person worth the trouble?\u0027 And on occasion, the answer is no.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The secret of Amnesty\u0027s success is its huge number of volunteers — 170,000 in 78 countries — who work on the case of a particular prisoner for years if necessary. They send letters and telegrams not only to government officials, but also to the prisoner himself. At times they send packages, or give financial aid to his family, or arrange for legal aid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A 100-member research team in London makes sure that every new case is thoroughly documented before assigning it to an \"adoption group\" of 12 to 20 people. This group generally receives the names of three prisoners from three different political systems, and meets once a month to work on the cases until a result is obtained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Riverside adoption group, dating back to 1966, was the first one established in the U.S. Today there are more than 100 in 32 states. All of these are monitored by David Hawk and his staff of 20 full-time workers at their Westside office. The $750,000 annual U.S. budget comes from members\u0027 contributions, foundations, and church agencies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hawk assumed the leadership of A.I.-U.S.A. in 1974. \"In the early \u002760s\n\u003cbr\u003e I worked in the civil rights movement in the Deep South,\" he recalls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"From 1967 to 1972 I was one of the organizers of the Moratorium\n\u003cbr\u003e Against the War. Then I worked in the McGovern campaign.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At about the same time he graduated from union Theological Seminary, and from there went to Oxford University in England, where he found out about Amnesty International. Returning to the U.S., he applied for the vacant post of executive director and was accepted. Ever since then he has been a resident of the West Side. David\u0027s wife Joan, a potter, is the editor of Matchbox.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hawk\u0027s biggest concern these days is to focus attention on the human rights covenants that President Carter has signed and is planning to send to the U.S. Senate for ratification. The covenants are worded almost the same as the United Nations\u0027 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed in December, 1948. \"Put into treaty form,\" explains Hawk, \"the articles will carry more weight. It\u0027s very important for governments to agree among themselves that they shouldn\u0027t torture their citizens, and should give them fair trials, and should provide food and housing and education for their citizens. Amnesty wants all governments to ratify the treaty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyone interest in volunteering some time to this worthy organization should write to: Amnesty International, 2112 Broadway, Room 309, New York, NY 10023.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44927.html","bookId":46,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:58:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:58:16 AM"}
