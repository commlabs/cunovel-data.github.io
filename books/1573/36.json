Young Smokies had all kinds of competitions, carrying weights or riding double, but no one was everthat stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost fell off on the first turn, zooming down a new path they\u0027d spiked with scrap metal only a few days before. The moment the board banked, her dirty feet skidded across the surface, spinning her halfway around. Her arms flailed wildly, but somehow Tally kept her footing, shooting across the compound and over the rabbit pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ragged cheer rose up below as the captives below saw her fly past and realized that someone was making an escape. Tally was too busy staying on board to glance down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegaining her balance, Tally realized she wasn\u0027t wearing crash bracelets. Any fall would be for real. Her toes gripped the board, and she vowed to take the next turn more slowly. If the sky had been cloudy this morning, the sun wouldn\u0027t have burned the dew off Croy\u0027s board yet. She\u0027d be lying in a crumpled heap in the pen, probably with a broken neck. It was lucky she, like most young Smokies, slept with her belly sensor on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, the whine of hovercars taking off came from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally knew only two ways out of the Smoke by hoverboard. Instinctively, she headed for the railroad tracks where she worked every day. The valley dropped behind her, and she managed to make the tight turn onto the white-water stream without falling off. With no knapsack and her heavy crash bracelets missing, Tally felt practically naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroy\u0027s board wasn\u0027t as fast as hers, and it didn\u0027t know her style. Riding it was like breaking in new shoes - while running for your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the water, spray struck her face, hands, and feet. Tally knelt, grasping the edge of the board with wet hands, flying as low as she dared. Down here, the spray might make it even harder to ride, but the barrier of the trees kept her invisible. She dared a glance backward. No hovercars had appeared yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she shot down the winding stream, swerving through the familiar hard turns, Tally thought of all the times she and David and Shay had raced each other to the work site. She wondered where David was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in camp, bound and ready to be taken to a city he\u0027d never seen before? Would he have his face filed down and replaced by a pretty mask, his brain turned into whatever mush the authorities decided would be acceptable for a former renegade raised in the wild?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, forcing the image from her mind. David hadn\u0027t been among the captured resistors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he\u0027d been caught, he definitely would have put up a fight. He must have escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar of a hovercar passed overhead, the shock wave of its passage almost throwing Tally from the board. A few seconds later, she knew it had spotted her, its screaming turn echoing through the forest as it cut back to the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows passed over Tally, and she glanced up to see two hovercars following her, their blades shimmering as bright as knives in the midmorning sun. The hovercars could go anywhere, but Tally was limited by her magnetic lifters. She was trapped on the route to the railroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally remembered her first ride out to Dr. Cable\u0027s office, the violent agility of the hovercar with its cruel pretty driver. In a straight line, they were much faster than any board. Her only advantage was that she knew this path backward and forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, it was hardly a straight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally gripped the board with both hands and jumped from the river to the ridge line. The cars disappeared into the distance, overshooting as she skimmed the iron vein. But Tally was out in the open now, the plains spreading out below her as huge as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed fleetingly that it was a perfect day, not a cloud in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally lay almost flat to cut down wind resistance, coaxing every ounce of speed from Croy\u0027s board. It didn\u0027t look like she\u0027d make it to the next cover before the two cars had swung around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered how they planned to capture her. Use a stunner? Throw a net? Simply bowl her over with their shock waves? At this speed and without crash bracelets, anything that knocked Tally off the board would kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was just fine with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scream of their blades came from her right, louder and louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before the sound reached her, Tally dragged herself into a full hoverskid, her momentum crushing her down into the board. The two hovercars shot past ahead, missing by a mile, but the wind of their passage spun her around in circles. The board flipped over and then back upright, Tally hanging on with both arms as the world spun wildly around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe regained control and urged it forward again, bringing it back to full speed before the hovercars could turn back around. The Specials might be faster, but her hoverboard was more maneuverable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the next turn drew near, the hovercars were headed straight for her, moving slower now, their pilots realizing that at top speed they would overshoot her every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet them try to fly below tree level, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow riding on her knees, gripping the board with both hands, Tally twisted into the next turn, dropping to skim just above the cracked dirt of the dry creek bed. She heard the whine of the hovercars steadily build.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were tracking her too easily, probably using her body heat to pick her out among the trees, like the minders back home. Tally remembered the little portable heater she\u0027d used to sneak out of the dorm so many times. If only she had it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Tally remembered the caves that David had shown her on her first day in the Smoke. Under the cold stones of the mountain, her body heat would disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored the sound of her pursuers, shooting down the creek bed and across a spur of ore, then onto the river that led to the railroad. She careened along above the water, and the hovercars stayed above tree height, patiently waiting for her to run out of cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the turnoff to the railroad approached, Tally increased her speed, skimming the water as fast as she dared. She took the turn at full skid and hurtled down the track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cars swept away down the river. The Specials might have expected her to turn off on another river, but the sudden appearance of an old railroad track had surprised them. If she could make it to the mountain before the hovercars completed their slow turns, she would be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in time, Tally remembered the spot where they had pulled up the track for scrap metal, and angled her board for a stomach-wrenching moment of freefall, soaring over the gap in a high arc. The lifters found metal again, and thirty seconds later she came to a skidding halt at the end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally jumped from the hoverboard, turned it around, and gave it a shove back toward the river. Without her crash bracelets to pull it back, the board would drift along the straight line of the railroad until it reached the break, where it would drop to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully, the Specials would think she\u0027d fallen off, and start their search back there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally crawled up the boulders and into the cave, scrambling back into the darkness. She pulled herself as far as she could go, hoping that the tons of stone overhead would be enough to hide her from the Specials. When the tiny aperture of light at the mouth of the cave had shrunk to the size of an eye, Tally dropped to the stone, panting, her hands still shaking from the flight, telling herself again and again that she\u0027d made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what had she made it to? She had no shoes, no hoverboard, no friends, not even a water purifier or a packet of SpagBol. No home to go back to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally was completely alone. \"I\u0027m so dead,\" she said aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice came out of the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tally? Is that you ?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-36.html","bookId":1573,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM"}
