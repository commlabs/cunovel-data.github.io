Anne shook her head. \"Well,\" she said, \"maybe this thing will come in handy after all.\" It was a poor attempt at a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the box of sugar in the cupboard and took off my suit coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne started to set the table and I stood by the kitchen window watching Richard and Candy run in erratic circles as they chased a butterfly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom?\" I heard Anne say. I looked back. \"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean about-?\" I couldn\u0027t find the word for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"What is there to do?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s not something you can put your finger on. I dream about a strange woman.\" I hadn\u0027t told her yet that I didn\u0027t believe it was a dream. \"I-think I can sense what\u0027s in Elsie\u0027s mind. I feel the same impact on my head that you do. I-pick up some of your thoughts about us needing sugar.\" I shrugged. \"What do I have there to work with? How do I start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could go see Alan Porter,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing wrong with my mind,\" I said, turning away and looking out the window again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you call it?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s happening in your mind, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but it isn\u0027t a-a breakdown. If anything-\" I paused a moment, realizing something. \"If anything it\u0027s an increase, not a decrease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that make you feel better about it?\" she asked. \"You\u0027re frightened, Tom. Admit it. I can feel how you shiver at night when you have that dream. Call it anything you like. What matters is that all it\u0027s done is disturb you. And I think you should do something about it. Soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said, uncertainly, \"I\u0027ll... do something.\" I felt as if I were being forced into an undesirable corner, though. Certainly I was afraid of what was happening to me. Yet I was intrigued by it too. All day at work I\u0027d kept picking up fragments of thought and emotion from the people around me in the office. Scraps of feeling irritation, boredom, weariness, daydreams, sexual and otherwise, wish fantasies. Vague disjointed visions and parts of phrases. I didn\u0027t know which person was thinking what, but that only enhanced the fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them, for instance, was imagining himself-or herself on an ocean voyage that he-or she-had been on or wanted to be on. I swear I could almost smell the sea air and feel the roll of a ship under me. Another one was thinking of some woman and the vision was strained and ugly; tinged with the same overtones of what I\u0027d sensed in Elsie\u0027s mind. It was a little sickening, yes, but still intriguing. I turned from the window as an idea occurred to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder,\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if I\u0027ve become-or if I\u0027m becoming a medium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A medium?\" Anne put down a bottle of milk hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, \"why not?\" The expression on her face made me smile. \"Honey, a medium doesn\u0027t have to be a lumpy, middle-aged woman in a button sweater, you know,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, think about it,\" I said. \"The word itself-medium-is a perfect description. It means a-middle place. That\u0027s what mediums are. They stand between the-the source and the goal, letting thoughts and impressions flow through them. They-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re a medium,\" she broke in, \"just tell me one thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me intently, accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why haven\u0027t you got any control over what\u0027s flowing through you? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis continued to be the topic of our conversation at supper-interspaced with enjoining and commands to Richard to eat his food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t understand,\" Anne said. \"You\u0027ve been suffering with this thing. I can see a change in you already-yes, in just a few days,\" she insisted when I started to contest it. \"You\u0027re pale. You\u0027re worn, tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t argue. There were the headaches and the feeling of lead-boned weariness that followed every exposure to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I can\u0027t see it then,\" Anne said, irritated at my apparent reversal of attitude. \"You agree it\u0027s hurting you and yet you tell me you don\u0027t want to do anything about it. Because you think you\u0027re a medium, or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I\u0027m not saying that,\" I said. \"What I\u0027m saying is that I want to see where it\u0027s going for a while. It is going somewhere; I feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... feel, feel.\" She pressed her lips together angrily. \"And what am I supposed to do at night when you jolt out of a sound sleep as if you\u0027d been shot? I\u0027m pregnant, Tom. I\u0027m nervous too; real nervous. Do you think it\u0027s going to help me to be exposed to that every night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang then and I got up and walked across the living room, wondering why I was feeling that tingling sensation. It was brief but most decided. While it lasted it was as if I were metallic and had passed into, then out of, a strong magnetic field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door and saw Harry Sentas standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I was surprised. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evening,\" he said. He was a tall, heavy-set man who, somehow, always looked unsuited to the clothes he wore. He would have looked more natural in overalls and a cap; maybe a grease stain across his florid cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I come to get the rent,\" he said. \"Figured I\u0027d save you a trip over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who there?\" Richard came padding into the room and I heard Anne call him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, isn\u0027t it two days yet?\" I asked Sentas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured you\u0027d wanna get it out of your hair before then,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" I cleared my throat. \"Well, if you want to wait, I\u0027ll go make out a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into the kitchen and got the check book out of the cupboard drawer. Anne looked questioningly at me and I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who that?\" Richard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man next door, baby,\" Anne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man ness door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made out the check, tore it out of the book and brought it to Sentas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obliged,\" he said, taking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, incidentally,\" I said, \"I wonder if you\u0027d get this door lock fixed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Door lock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It can\u0027t be locked from the outside. When we leave the house we have to lock it from the inside and leave the patio door open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" he said. \"I\u0027ll see about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d appreciate it,\" I told him as he turned away and stepped over the plants onto the lawn. I watched him a moment walking toward his house. Then I shut the door and returned to my supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this going to happen every month?\" Anne said. \"I thought it was an accident the first two times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t like it, though.\" Anne shrugged. \"He\u0027s just worried about his money, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His wife\u0027s money,\" I said. \"According to Frank she\u0027s the one that\u0027s loaded.\" She smiled, shaking her head. \"Good old Frank,\" she said. \"Always has a good word for everybody.\" I exhaled. \"Well, I don\u0027t like Sentas,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne looked up from her plate. \"Is this your-medium business?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, you make me sound like some kind of freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027d say it\u0027s a little freakish, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feakish,\" Richard said, \"feakish, mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, baby,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t regard myself as a freak,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s not be so sensitive about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one that\u0027s sensitive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think I have some reason to be?\" she asked, irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s hard on you but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re getting a bang out of it, so that\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, let\u0027s not argue,\" I said. \"Look. I\u0027ll let it go on a little while longer. I promise you if it gets on your nerves, if it frightens you or anything, I\u0027ll-I\u0027ll go to Alan Porter. Is that fair enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom, it\u0027s you that\u0027s getting frightened and nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... Fm willing to stick it out a while longer,\" I told her. \"I confess it makes me curious. Doesn\u0027t it you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated before answering. Finally she inclined her head in a grudging gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s... unusual, all right,\" she said, \"but... well, if it throws our whole life out of balance, is it worth it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let it do that,\" I said. \"You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we went to sleep that night, we came across something that provided a definite clue. I\u0027d asked Anne to try and remember what had happened during the hypnosis and whether Phil had said anything that might have started me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered two things. Neither was definite, of course; you never do find anything definite in something like this. But both were highly suggestive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne remark was made when I was reliving segments of my twelfth year. Phil had said, in answer to somebody\u0027s question, \"No, there\u0027s no limit to what his mind can do. It\u0027s capable of anything.\" The second remark came when Phil was bringing me out of the hypnosis-and here, to me, was the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mind is free now,\" he\u0027d said to me. \"There\u0027s nothing binding it. It\u0027s free, absolutely free.\" It\u0027s something he\u0027d said a hundred times before to hypnotized subjects. As I understand it, it\u0027s a command designed to prevent the subject\u0027s mind from retaining any suggestions inadvertently given which might later prove harmful. As I say, Phil had used it a hundred times; he verified that later. Yet, for some reason, with me it had backfired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up with a gasp and felt the cold night air pressing at my sweat streaked face; felt my heart pounding as I stared frozenly toward the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in there again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there rigidly, my stomach muscles cramped and twitching, trying to make myself get up and go in there. But I couldn\u0027t. Will power was swept away. I saw her in my mind and it was more than I could do to get up, walk in there and find her, white and still, staring at me with her dark eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started with a frightened grunt and my heart leaped so hard it seemed to jolt against the wall of my chest. Then I swallowed with effort and drew in a long, shaking breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And... she\u0027s in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt her shudder against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom,\" she said and there was something different in her voice; something that didn\u0027t question. \"Tom, what does she want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I answered as if, all along, we had both accepted the woman as objective reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s-still there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...\" I thought I heard her sob and I reached out to touch her. I felt her hand against her mouth. She was biting the heel of it-hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anne, Anne,\" I whispered, \"it\u0027s all right. She can\u0027t hurt us.\" She pulled away her hand. Her voice broke over me in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" she asked. \"Are you just going to lie here and let this thing go on? If she\u0027s really in there, if she\u0027s what you say she is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we both stopped breathing at the same time. I stared at the dark outline of her, feeling my heart thud slowly, draggingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anne?\" I heard myself murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t... don\u0027t you believe what Phil said? That it\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my hands shaking and I couldn\u0027t answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause suddenly I realized that I didn\u0027t believe what Phil had said. That I\u0027d never believed him. It wasn\u0027t telepathy; it was something more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stir-of-echoes/page-6.html","bookId":2543,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:05:32 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:05:32 AM"}
