To save Humphrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loves me. She felt it to her soul, knew it in her bones. She wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. He loved her, and it explained so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet one mystery remained. What would the smugglers want with her uncle? She hunched low on the ladder, straining to hear more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm yourself, man. We have need of you on the plantation. But you\u0027ll get paid. In fact, we\u0027ll settle our accounts with profits from the sale of this fool” It was Jack\u0027s voice, and he was obviously talking about selling Cormac. The thought sickened and terrified her both. But pay whom? Who else was involved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These Highlanders fetch an especially high bounty,” a woman said, and though her voice was muffled, Marjorie picked out a few words. “They\u0027ve a scarcity of lands yet a surplus of mettle. Ideal laborers.” There was a round of laughter, and something about the throaty feminine chuckle struck a chord. The bailie\u0027s wife. Marjorie\u0027s stomach churned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, precious,” Jack said. “Selling the MacAlpin will get us more than enough to pay off Lord Keith.” The rare sound of her uncle\u0027s laughter rumbled up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood drained from Marjorie\u0027s head. Without thought, her hand flew to her temple, her palm clammy and numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePay off Lord Keith. Humphrey Keith. Her uncle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship pitched again, and this time Marjorie slipped and tumbled from the ladder, plummeting to the deck below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay there unmoving, feeling like a broken doll strewn along the wooden planks. Marjorie gave herself a moment to figure out if she\u0027d done any permanent damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ree!” Cormac tried to jerk away from his brother, but Aidan\u0027s fingers dug into him. Cormac had always been able to take his twin in a fight, but the gun barrel jammed at his temple held him back. “Are you all right? Speak to me, love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing to a seated position, she gave him a nod, and it sent pain thrumming up her body. She shifted and gave a roll to her shoulders, realizing her left side had absorbed most of the damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” His relief flipped into anger. “Then tell me, what in hell are you doing here?” Fingers curled hard into her upper arms as Jack snatched her from the floor. He wrenched her close, and she couldn\u0027t help yelping with the painful shock of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get off her.” Cormac bucked against Aidan. “I swear to God, I\u0027ll cut off your stones and feed them to the fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you harm her, I\u0027ll flay you, and then I\u0027ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe click of Aidan pulling his pistol to half cock stilled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gun at Cormac\u0027s temple, and it made her feel outraged and helpless. How could Humphrey be involved in something like this? “What\u0027s happening?” she demanded of her uncle. “Why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och, Ree,” Cormac whispered. The look of pity on his face would\u0027ve warmed her if it hadn\u0027t also confirmed her suspicions. “I\u0027m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Cormac, saw the machinations on his face. He\u0027d be thinking about simply turning and attacking his brother, despite the gun. “Don\u0027t,” she whispered. Her pride and well-being meant nothing if he got himself killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So touching,” a woman\u0027s voice purred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie\u0027s eyes flew to the corner of the cabin, knowing already whom she\u0027d find. The bailie\u0027s wife stood in the shadows, looking like a Turk in what she imagined was Adele\u0027s lush interpretation of female sailors\u0027 clothing. The sight of the woman\u0027s smirk made Marjorie ill. “Why are you here? Would someone tell me what\u0027s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let Marjorie go,” Cormac said, his voice low with fury. “She has naught to do with this. Let her go, and you can have me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already have you, MacAlpin.” Grinning, Jack gave Marjorie a shake. “And now I have your wench as well.” She flailed in the smuggler\u0027s grip. The sensation of utter powerlessness infuriated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumphrey\u0027s sagging cheeks went red. “That wasn\u0027t part of the deal. Let the girl go. You will give me what I\u0027m owed, put us in that… that dilapidated craft you keep on deck, and you\u0027ll not see either of us again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Craft? You mean my captain\u0027s gig? Ach, but that\u0027s the boat I use to get to shore.” Jack paused, feigning consideration. “No, I think not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie tried to stomp on the smuggler\u0027s foot, but he sidestepped her with an amused laugh. She made an exasperated growl, feeling like a trapped animal. “Humphrey! Why are you even with these people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut her up,” Aidan growled to Cormac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shut up.” Marjorie raised her chin high, as though they were ten again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were to stay out of this, girl.” Humphrey\u0027s jowls quivered with exasperation. “Whatever I do, I do for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you won\u0027t die a destitute spinster. But like a fox in the henhouse, you insist on hunting for mischief. Always it\u0027s been so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a side of her uncle she\u0027d never seen, and she flushed red, feeling like a child put in her place. Tears stung her eyes, hurt more by his words than from any of Jack\u0027s pawing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ll not speak to her that way,” Cormac said, his voice like frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You?” Humphrey pushed his chair back and stood, moving as slowly as a barge out of harbor. “You tell me how to speak to my niece? You\u0027re a dead man.” Even in his anger, he looked befuddled. “I never did trust you MacAlpins… “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentlemen, please.” The bailie\u0027s wife sauntered into the fray, going to Jack\u0027s side. Marjorie coughed from the thick scent of her perfume, a cloying mix of sandalwood and cloves. Adele distractedly petted at the smuggler, giving a quick twirl to his hair. “You overestimate your value, Humphrey. Unlike your niece here.” She tweaked Marjorie\u0027s ear. “I imagine she\u0027ll fetch a fair price, even though I\u0027d wager she\u0027s no longer a virgin.” Marjorie sputtered in outrage, flinching away from the other woman\u0027s clutch. “You… you wench! You\u0027re a… a… a nasty, spiteful, hateful virago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I indeed?” Chuckling, Adele leaned closer, taunting her. “Such fury, Lady Brodie. Perhaps a honeymoon sail to Barbados with your \u0027husband\u0027 will cool your anger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac wrestled against his brother, but Aidan pressed the pistol even harder into his temple. The sight of it put ice in her veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about your husband, Lady Forbes?” Marjorie asked, her voice level and cool. “Is he involved in this, too?” She shifted her glare to Jack. “I hear three\u0027s the charm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nuzzled Marjorie\u0027s neck, inhaling deeply. “Don\u0027t tempt me, luwie.” She recoiled with an outraged gasp. “You disgust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I warned you,” Cormac snarled through gritted teeth. “Get off her.” Tittering with laughter, Adele traced her fingers along the smuggler\u0027s collar. “When it comes to the finer things, my husband the bailie” — she smirked with contempt — “is a dilettante. But Jack, here, has more of a sense for women… for wealth… “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unearthly groan shuddered the ship\u0027s timber underfoot. Marjorie\u0027s heartbeat kicked up a notch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re wasting time.” Cormac began to wrestle free, but his twin kept the barrel dug into his skin. “Go to the devil, Aidan,” he sneered at his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear it\u0027s you who\u0027s the devil.” Adele turned a languid gaze Cormac\u0027s way, giving him a sultry wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie jerked against Jack\u0027s grip. His hold on her was the only reason she hadn\u0027t already clawed the witch\u0027s eyes out. “You\u0027re naught but a… a… harridan, who\u0027s lured my uncle into a web of deceit and disrepute.” Her uncle huffed with indignation. “Relax, girl. There\u0027s nothing disreputable about it. I\u0027m an investor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Investor?” she asked, perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In their plantations.” Humphrey looked away, directing his words to the smuggler. “An investor who\u0027s about to grow very angry indeed, unless I am escorted from this tub posthaste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Investor?” Jack mused, echoing Marjorie. “You\u0027re a so-called botanicals expert, who\u0027d best start proving more obliging. The cane crops are failing. I\u0027m beginning to doubt your competence, old man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The gall of you!” Marjorie exclaimed. Hurt and confused she might be, but nobody insulted her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re a saucy chit.” Jack tried to nip at her ear. She smelled him coming, and she ducked her head away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saucy?” Marjorie wriggled an arm free and jammed her hand in her skirts. “I\u0027ll show you sauce.” Cormac stiffened, his single-minded focus on her, and it felt to Ree as though they were in a pot set to boil over. She decided she\u0027d be the one to raise the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jabbed the belaying pin hard at Jack\u0027s groin. She missed, but it caught his hip, and he grunted. But then the smuggler only laughed, snatching her weapon from her as easily as a toy from a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little she-wolf, is it?” Jack flung the pin down and scrubbed his hand up her bodice, groping her. “I enjoy a lass with backbone. Now let\u0027s see how far it can bend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie thrashed like a wild thing, horrified by the unmistakable hunger on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave her be,” Cormac said, rage seething in his voice. “Aidan, let me go, or I swear to you, one of us dies right here, right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bailie\u0027s wife pulled a tiny lady\u0027s pistol from her stocking and aimed it at Marjorie. “I\u0027ve had enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A woman\u0027s envy,” Aidan mused. His unconcerned tone infuriated Marjorie more than Adele\u0027s pistol. “Isn\u0027t that one of the deadly sins?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdele cocked her weapon. She stood stiffly, arms outstretched in front of her. “Step away, Jack. We\u0027ll take a loss on this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension stilled the room. Even Aidan seemed to hold his breath at Cormac\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie felt the smuggler hesitate, and Adele gestured with the barrel of her pistol. “I said move away. Now.” Marjorie stared at the bailie\u0027s wife in disbelief. “You won\u0027t shoot me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-48.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
