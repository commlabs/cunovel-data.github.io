In the vast volume of space, not all the navies ever in existence could keep their watch in tight proximity. Given a single ship, a skillful pilot, and a moderate degree of luck, and there are holes and to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith cold-eyed calm, Toran drove a protesting vessel from the vicinity of one star to that of another. If the neighborhood of great mass made an interstellar jump erratic and difficult, it also made the enemy detection devices useless or nearly so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd once the girdle of ships had been passed the inner sphere of dead space, through whose blockaded sub-ether no message could be driven, was passed as well. For the first time in over three months Toran felt unisolated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week passed before the enemy news programs dealt with anything more than the dull, self-laudatory details of growing control over the Foundation. It was a week in which Toran\u0027s armored trading ship fled inward from the Periphery in hasty jumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbling Mis called out to the pilot room and Toran rose blink-eyed from his charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Toran stepped down into the small central chamber which Bayta had inevitably devised into a living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMis shook his head, \"Bescuppered if I know. The Mule\u0027s newsmen are announcing a special bulletin. Thought you might want to get in on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might as well. Where\u0027s Bayta?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Setting the table in the diner and picking out a menuor some such frippery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran sat down upon the cot that served as Magnifico\u0027s bed, and waited. The propaganda routine of the Mule\u0027s \"special bulletins\" were monotonously similar. First the martial music, and then the buttery slickness of the announcer. The minor news items would come, following one another in patient lock step. Then the pause. Then the trumpets and the rising excitement and the climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran endured it. Mis muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newscaster spilled out, in conventional war-correspondent phraseology, the unctuous words that translated into sound the molten metal and blasted flesh of a battle in space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rapid cruiser squadrons under Lieutenant General Sammin hit back hard today at the task force striking out from Iss-\" The carefully expressionless face of the speaker upon the screen faded into the blackness of a space cut through by the quick swaths of ships reeling across emptiness in deadly battle. The voice continued through the soundless thunder\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The most striking action of the battle was the subsidiary combat of the heavy cruiser Cluster against three enemy ships of the \u0027Nova\u0027 class-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen\u0027s view veered and closed in. A great ship sparked and one of the frantic attackers glowed angrily, twisted out of focus, swung back and rammed. The Cluster bowed wildly and survived the glancing blow that drove the attacker off in twisting reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newsman\u0027s smooth unimpassioned delivery continued to the last blow and the last hulk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a pause, and a large similar voice-and-picture of the fight off Mnemon, to which the novelty was added of a lengthy description of a hit-and-run landing - the picture of a blasted city - huddled and weary prisoners - and off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMnemon had not long to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pause again - and this time the raucous sound of the expected brasses. The screen faded into the long, impressively soldier-lined corridor up which the government spokesman in councilor\u0027s uniform strode quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was oppressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that came at last was solemn, slow and hard: \"By order of our sovereign, it is announced that the planet, Haven, hitherto in warlike opposition to his will, has submitted to the acceptance of defeat. At this moment, the forces of our sovereign are occupying the planet. Opposition was scattered, unco-ordinated, and speedily crushed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene faded out, the original newsman returned to state importantly that other developments would be transmitted as they occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was dance music, and Ebling Mis threw the shield that cut the power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran rose and walked unsteadily away, without a word. The psychologist made no move to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bayta stepped out of the kitchen, Mis motioned silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"They\u0027ve taken Haven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bayta said, \"Already?\" Her eyes were round, and sick with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without a fight. Without an unprin-\" He stopped and swallowed. \"You\u0027d better leave Toran alone. It\u0027s not pleasant for him. Suppose we eat without him this once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta looked once toward the pilot room, then turned hopelessly. \"Very well!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico sat unnoticed at the table. He neither spoke nor ate but stared ahead with a concentrated fear that seemed to drain all the vitality out of his thread of a body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbling Mis pushed absently at his iced-fruit dessert and said, harshly, \"Two Trading worlds fight. They fight, and bleed, and die and don\u0027t surrender. Only at Haven - Just as at the Foundation-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe psychologist shook his head. \"It\u0027s of a piece with all the problem. Every queer facet is a hint at the nature of the Mule. First, the problem of how he could conquer the Foundation, with little blood, and at a single blow essentially - while the Independent Trading Worlds held out. The blanket on nuclear reactions was a puny weapon - we\u0027ve discussed that back and forth till I\u0027m sick of it - and it did not work on any but the Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Randu suggested,\" and Ebling\u0027s grizzly eyebrows pulled together, \"it might have been a radiant Will-Depresser. It\u0027s what might have done the work on Haven. But then why wasn\u0027t it used on Mnemon and Iss - which even now fight with such demonic intensity that it is taking half the Foundation fleet in addition to the Mule\u0027s forces to beat them down. Yes, I recognized Foundation ships in the attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta whispered, \"The Foundation, then Haven. Disaster seems to follow us, without touching. We always seem to get out by a hair. Will it last forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbling Mis was not listening. To himself, he was making a point. \"But there\u0027s another problem - another problem. Bayta, you remember the news item that the Mule\u0027s clown was not found on Terminus; that it was suspected he had fled to Haven, or been carried there by his original kidnappers. There is an importance attached to him, Bayta, that doesn\u0027t fade, and we have not located it yet. Magnifico must know something that is fatal to the Mule. I\u0027m sure of it. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico, white and stuttering, protested, \"Sire... noble lord... indeed, I swear it is past my poor reckoning to penetrate your wants. I have told what I know to the utter limits, and with your probe, you have drawn out of my meager wit that which I knew, but knew not that I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know... I know. It is something small. A hint so small that neither you nor I recognize it for what it is. Yet I must find it - for Mnemon and Iss will go soon, and when they do, we are the last remnants, the last droplets of the independent Foundation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stars begin to cluster closely when the core of the Galaxy is penetrated. Gravitational fields begin to overlap at intensities sufficient to introduce perturbations in an interstellar jump that can not be overlooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran became aware of that when a jump landed their ship in the full glare of a red giant which clutched viciously, and whose grip was loosed, then wrenched apart, only after twelve sleepless, soul-battering hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith charts limited in scope, and an experience not at all fully developed, either operationally or mathematically, Toran resigned himself to days of careful plotting between jumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became a community project of a sort. Ebling Mis checked Toran\u0027s mathematics and Bayta tested possible routes, by the various generalized methods, for the presence of real solutions. Even Magnifico was put to work on the calculating machine for routine computations, a type of work, which, once explained, was a source of great amusement to him and at which he was surprisingly proficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo at the end of a month, or nearly, Bayta was able to survey the red line that wormed its way through the ship\u0027s trimensional model of the Galactic Lens halfway to its center, and say with Satiric relish, \"You know what it looks like. It looks like a ten-foot earth-worm with a terrific case of indigestion. Eventually, you\u0027ll land us back in Haven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" growled Toran, with a fierce rustle of his chart, \"if you don\u0027t shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And at that,\" continued Bayta, \"there is probably a route fight through, straight as a meridian of longitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Well, in the first place, dimwit, it probably took five hundred ships five hundred years to work out that route by hit-and-miss, and my lousy half-credit charts don\u0027t give it. Besides, maybe those straight routes are a good thing to avoid. They\u0027re probably choked up with ships. And besides-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for Galaxy\u0027s sake, stop driveling and slavering so much righteous indignation.\" Her hands were in his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yowled, \"Ouch! Let go!\" seized her wrists and whipped downward, whereupon Toran, Bayta, and chair formed a tangled threesome on the floor. It degenerated into a panting wrestling match, composed mostly of choking laughter and various foul blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran broke loose at Magnifico\u0027s breathless entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines of anxiety puckered the clown\u0027s face and tightened the skin whitely over the enormous bridge of his nose. \"The instruments are behaving queerly, sir. I have not, in the knowledge of my ignorance, touched anything-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn two seconds, Toran was in the pilot room. He said quietly to Magnifico, \"Wake up Ebling Mis. Have him come down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to Bayta, who was trying to get a basic order back to her hair by use of her fingers, \"We\u0027ve been detected, Bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detected?\" And Bayta\u0027s arms dropped. \"By whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Galaxy knows,\" muttered Toran, \"but I imagine by someone with blasters already ranged and trained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down and in a low voice was already sending into the sub-ether the ship\u0027s identification code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Ebling Mis entered, bathrobed and blear-eyed, Toran said with a desperate calm, \"It seems we\u0027re inside the borders of a local Inner Kingdom which is called the Autarchy of Filia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never heard of it,\" said Mis, abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, neither did I,\" replied Toran, \"but we\u0027re being stopped by a Filian ship just the same, and I don\u0027t know what it will involve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain-inspector of the Filian ship crowded aboard with six armed men following him. He was short, thin-haired, thin-lipped, and dry-skinned. He coughed a sharp cough as he sat down and threw open the folio under his arm to a blank page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your passports and ship\u0027s clearance, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have none,\" said Toran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None, hey?\" he snatched up a microphone suspended from his belt and spoke into it quickly, \"Three men and one woman. Papers not in order.\" He made an accompanying notation in the folio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Where are you from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Siwenna,\" said Toran warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty thousand parsecs, eighty degrees west Trantor, forty degrees-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind, never mind!\" Toran could see that his inquisitor had written down: \"Point of origin - Periphery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Filian continued, \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran said, \"Trantor sector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Purpose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleasure trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carrying any cargo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm-m-m. We\u0027ll check on that.\" He nodded and two men jumped to activity. Toran made no move to interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What brings you into Filian territory?\" The Filian\u0027s eyes gleamed unamiably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t know we were. I lack a proper chart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be required to pay a hundred credits for that lack - and, of course, the usual fees required for tariff duties, et cetera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke again into the microphone - but listened more than he spoke. Then, to Toran, \"Know anything about nuclear technology?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" replied Toran, guardedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" The Filian closed his folio, and added, \"The men of the Periphery have a knowledgeable reputation that way. Put on a suit and come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta stepped forward, \"What are you going to do with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran put her aside gently, and asked coldly, \"Where do you want me to come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our power plant needs minor adjustments. He\u0027ll come with you.\" His pointing finger aimed directly at Magnifico, whose brown eyes opened wide in a blubbery dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he got to do with it?\" demanded Toran fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official looked up coldly. \"I am informed of pirate activities in this vicinity. A description of one of the known thugs tallies roughly. It is a purely routine matter of identification. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran hesitated, but six men and six blasters are eloquent arguments. He reached into the cupboard for the suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, he rose upright in the bowels of the Filian ship and raged, \"There\u0027s not a thing wrong with the motors that I can see. The busbars are true, the L-tubes are feeding properly and the reaction analysis checks. Who\u0027s in charge here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head engineer said quietly, \"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, get me out of here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was led to the officers\u0027 level and the small anteroom held only an indifferent ensign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the man who came with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please wait,\" said the ensign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was fifteen minutes later that Magnifico was brought in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they do to you?\" asked Toran quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Nothing at all.\" Magnifico\u0027s head shook a slow negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took two hundred and fifty credits to fulfill the demands of Filia - fifty credits of it for instant release - and they were in free space again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta said with a forced laugh, \"Don\u0027t we rate an escort? Don\u0027t we get the usual figurative boot over the border?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Toran replied, grimly, \"That was no Filian ship - and we\u0027re not leaving for a while. Come in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gathered about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, whitely, \"That was a Foundation ship, and those were the Mule\u0027s men aboard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbling bent to pick up the cigar he had dropped. He said, \"Here? We\u0027re fifteen thousand parsecs from the Foundation. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027re here. What\u0027s to prevent them from making the same trip. Galaxy, Ebling, don\u0027t you think I can tell ships apart? I saw their engines, and that\u0027s enough for me. I tell you it was a Foundation engine in a Foundation ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how did they get here?\" asked Bayta, logically. \"What are the chances of a random meeting of two given ships in space?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that to do with it?\" demanded Toran, hotly. \"It would only show we\u0027ve been followed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Followed?\" hooted Bayta. \"Through hyperspace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbling Mis interposed wearily, \"That can be done - given a good ship and a great pilot. But the possibility doesn\u0027t impress me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been masking my trail,\" insisted Toran. \"I\u0027ve been building up take-off speed on the straight. A blind man could have calculated our route.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blazes he could,\" cried Bayta. \"With the cockeyed jumps you are making, observing our initial direction didn\u0027t mean a thing. We came out of the jump wrong-end forwards more than once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re wasting time,\" blazed Toran, with gritted teeth. \"It\u0027s a Foundation ship under the Mule. It\u0027s stopped us. It\u0027s searched us. It\u0027s had Magnifico - alone - with me as hostage to keep the rest of you quiet, in case you suspected. And we\u0027re going to bum it out of space right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on now,\" and Ebling Mis clutched at him. \"Are you going to destroy us for one ship you think is an enemy? Think, man, would those scuppers chase us over an impossible route half through the bestinkered Galaxy, look us over, and then let us go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still interested in where we\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why stop us and put us on our guard?

Let go of me, Ebling, or I\u0027ll knock you down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico leaned forward from his balanced perch on his favorite chair back. His long nostrils flared with excitement. \"I crave your pardon for my interruption, but my poor mind is of a sudden plagued with a queer thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta anticipated Toran\u0027s gesture of annoyance, and added her grip to Ebling\u0027s. \"Go ahead and speak, Magnifico. We will all listen faithfully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico said, \"In my stay in their ship what addled wits I have were bemazed and bemused by a chattering fear that befell men. Of a truth I have a lack of memory of most that happened. Many men staring at me, and talk I did not understand. But towards the last - as though a beam of sunlight had dashed through a cloud rift - there was a face I knew. A glimpse, the merest glimmer - and yet it glows in my memory ever stronger and brighter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran said, \"Who was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That captain who was with us so long a time ago, when first you saved me from slavery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had obviously been Magnifico\u0027s intention to create a sensation, and the delighted smile that curled broadly in the shadow of his proboscis, attested to his realization of the intention\u0027s success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain... Han... Pritcher?\" demanded Mis, sternly. \"You\u0027re sure of that? Certain sure now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, I swear,\" and he laid a bone-thin hand upon his narrow chest. \"I would uphold the truth of it before the Mule and swear it in his teeth, though all his power were behind him to deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta said in pure wonder, \"Then what\u0027s it all about?\" The clown faced her eagerly, \"My lady, I have a theory. It came upon me, ready made, as though the Galactic Spirit had gently laid it in my mind.\" He actually raised his voice above Toran\u0027s interrupting objection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lady,\" he addressed himself exclusively to Bayta, \"if this captain had, like us, escaped with a ship; if he, like us, were on a trip for a purpose of his own devising; if he blundered upon us - he would suspect us of following and waylaying him, as we suspect him of the like. What wonder he played this comedy to enter our ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he want us in his ship, then?\" demanded Toran. \"That doesn\u0027t fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes, it does,\" clamored the clown, with a flowing inspiration. \"He sent an underling who knew us not, but who described us into his microphone. The listening captain would be struck at my own poor likeness - for, of a truth there are not many in this great Galaxy who bear a resemblance to my scantiness. I was the proof of the identity of the rest of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so he leaves us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we know of his mission, and the secrecy thereof? lie has spied us out for not an enemy and having it done so, must he needs think it wise to risk his plan by widening the knowledge thereof?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta said slowly, \"Don\u0027t be stubborn, Torie. It does explain things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be,\" agreed Mis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran seemed helpless in the face of united resistance. Something in the clown\u0027s fluent explanations bothered him. Something was wrong. Yet he was bewildered and, in spite of himself, his anger ebbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while,\" he whispered, \"I thought we might have had one of the Mule\u0027s ships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his eyes were dark with the pain of Haven\u0027s loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others understood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/foundation-and-empire-foundation-2/page-23.html","bookId":2018,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:06:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:06:30 PM"}
