I wasn’t going that far, but now that he mentioned it, why not? According to Blake, I had potential to be stronger than Daemon. Crossing my arms over my chest, I tapped the edge of the knife on my arm. “Yeah, what if I wanted to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again, and I wanted to kick him. “Kitten, you’re not helping me fight Arum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? If I can control the Source and help, why not? I could fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the reasons are pretty huge,” he yelled, all the humor vanishing. “First off, you’re a human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. “Granted, you’re a mutated human, but a human who’s a hell of a lot weaker and more vulnerable than a Luxen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled slowly. “You don’t know how weak or vulnerable I’ll be fully trained.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever. Secondly, you have no business going up against the Arum. That will never happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t if I’m still alive. Do you understand that? You will never go after an Arum. I don’t care if you can stop the world from spinning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to push down my anger. One thing I hated more than Daemon’s douche-nozzle side was him telling me what to do. “You don’t own me, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not about ownership, you little nut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nut?” I glared at him. “I wouldn’t call me names when I have a knife in my hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored that. “Thirdly, there is something off about Blake. You can’t tell me you don’t see or sense that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, don’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know nothing about him—nothing deeper than that he likes to surf and blog. Big deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These aren’t good enough reasons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I don’t want you in danger—how about that? Is that damn good enough for you?” he shouted, and I jumped. He looked away, drawing in several deep breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t realized that could’ve been the real reason behind it all. About every part of me softened, and my temper slipped away like a snowflake melting. “Daemon, you can’t stop me just to protect me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head swung back to me. “I need to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed was such a strong word that it stole my breath and my heart. “Daemon, I’m flattered—I am, but your job is not to protect me. I’m not Dee. I’m not another one of your responsibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn right you’re not Dee! But you are my responsibility. I got you into this mess. And I will not be dragging you further into it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head was spinning. His reasons for wanting me to stop training with Blake were right but all wrong. I needed to prove to him that I wasn’t a liability or something to be constantly watched over. If he felt that way and did keep putting himself in jeopardy because of me, he could lose his own life or Dee’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not stopping,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stared at me. “Does it even matter that I don’t want you in that kind of danger? That I won’t facilitate something as idiotic as you gearing up to go against the Arum?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched. Ouch, that stung. “Wanting to help you and your kind is idiotic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw tightened. “Yeah, it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon,” I whispered. “I get that you care—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t get it. That’s the problem!” He stopped, pulling it all back in, sucking the air right out of the room with it. “I won’t be a part of this. I mean it, Katy. You chose this, then…whatever. I won’t have this hanging over my head like I do every freaking day with Dawson. I won’t make another mistake and condone this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a sharp breath. My chest ached at the thought of him carrying that kind of guilt—guilt that didn’t belong to him. “Daemon—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will it be, Katy?” He looked at me dead-on. “Tell me now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what to tell you,” I whispered, tears burning my eyes. Didn’t he see? Going through with this would give me a better chance of not turning out like Bethany and Dawson, of being able to take care of myself and protect him, because one day, he’d need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon took a step back as though I’d hit him. “That was the wrong thing to say.” His face turned hard, his eyes like glaciers. The coldness radiating from him chilled me to the bone. He’d never looked more detached. “I’m done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me wanted to skip classes the next day, but it wasn’t like I could hide forever. Unexpectedly, Daemon was a no-show. I didn’t see him in the halls, either, or when I grabbed my stuff out of my locker before lunch. He never showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d chased him right out of the damn school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Blake said, strolling up to me. “You don’t look any better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the duration of bio, I’d pretty much had my face stuck in my textbook. I sighed, closing the door. “Yeah, not feeling it today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hungry?” When I shook my head, he tugged on my backpack. “Me neither. I know a place to go, no food and no people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounded good to me, because the last thing I could stomach right now was watching Adam and Dee go to second base at the lunch table. Turned out, the place Blake had in mind was the empty auditorium. Perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in the back, propping our feet up on the seats in front of us. Blake pulled an apple from his bag. “Did Daemon ever calm down last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned inwardly. “Yeah…not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was afraid of that.” There was a pause as he bit into the shiny red fruit. “You really weren’t in any danger. If you didn’t stop it, one of us would’ve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” I scooted down and laid my head on the back of my seat. “He just doesn’t want to see me hurt.” And that actually hurt to say, because I knew there was a mile-long road of good intentions behind what he had been saying last night, but he needed to see me as an equal. Not someone who was weak and needed rescuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s admirable.” Blake grinned around his apple. “You know I don’t like the tool, but he cares about you. And I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to cause trouble between you two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not your fault.” I patted his knee, not surprised when I got a little shock. “Everything will be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded. “Can I ask you something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another bite before he continued. “Is Daemon the one who healed you? I ask, because it may give me a better understanding of your power to know who changed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiousness blossomed. “Why would you think it was him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake gave me a pointed look. “It would explain how close you two are. My friend and I were close afterward. I almost always knew when he was around. We were like two halves of the same whole after he healed me. It was a strong…bond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealing me was so forbidden that even an army of Arum couldn’t get me to admit that it had been Daemon. “That’s good to know, but that’s not the case.” Curiosity did get the best of me, though. “You say you two were close. Did it make you…attracted to him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” He laughed. “No. We were like brothers, but the connection—whatever it is that they do to us—doesn’t force us to feel anything. It just makes us close to who healed us. It’s stronger than a familial bond, but not sexual or even emotional on that kind of level.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my lashes before he could see the rush of fresh tears that burned my eyes. Great. I was the biggest asshat alive. This whole time I’d kept throwing the alien connection in Daemon’s face and it hadn’t been what was propelling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s good to know.” My own voice sounded strange to me. “Anyway...why is it so important who healed me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me like he doubted my IQ as he finished off his apple. “Because I hear that how strong the Luxen is who heals you is an indication of how much stronger you’ll be. At least, that’s what I’ve picked up from Liz. Her power and limitations were linked to who healed her. Same as me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Well, that explained how I blasted a satellite into outer space. Daemon’s ego would go through the charts if he knew. I started to grin, but thinking of him renewed the ache in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which is why I thought it was Daemon, but he’s pretty damn powerful. No offense, but you really haven’t done anything extraordinary, so…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gee, thanks?” I laughed at his chagrined look. “Anyway, it’s not anyone you’d ever expect, and that’s all I’m willing to say about it, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” He held up the core of his apple, frowning. “You don’t trust me, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was quick to tell him that I did, I stopped. Someone at least deserved my honesty. “Don’t take it personally, but right now, I think trust is something not easily given, considering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake glanced at me sideways and smiled. “Good idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I saw another knife in the next ten years, I’d need long-term psychiatric care. Spending time with a knife being thrown at me wasn’t my idea of fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, I’d been able to stop them all. And without Daemon there, Blake stayed in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved onto throwing non-deadly stuff at my head, like pillows and books, by the end of the week. After several hours, I’d mastered the art of not eating fabric. I never let the books hit me or the floor, though. That just seemed sacrilegious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed ass backward to start off with the knives and end with the pillow, but I understood his master plan. My ability was also tied to my emotions—like fear. I needed to be able to tap into those strong feelings and use them when I wasn’t freaking out. I also needed to be able to control them when I was spazzing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned as I picked up all of the pillows off the floor and the books off the coffee table, putting them each back where they belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tired?” Blake commented, lounging against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” I yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know how the Luxen get tired from using their powers?” Blake grabbed the last book, placing it where he’d gotten it: the TV stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, and I remember you saying something about us tiring out faster than they do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are just like the Luxen in that sense. They use up energy to do things—the whole sending-a-piece-of-them thing? We’re the same way, but they can go a lot longer than we can. I don’t know why. Has something to do with the fact that we only have half-alien DNA, but we have to be careful, Katy. The more abilities we use, the weaker we get. And faster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” I muttered. “So Daemon could’ve really held you against the wall all night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep.” He stopped beside me. “Sugar helps. But so does the Melody Stone.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-32.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
