Much to his surprise, he felt in a good humour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact after a while he pushed his hood back and glanced up at the barber\u0027s apprentice, who tied a towel around his neck in that unseeing, hypnotised way that Mort was coming to recognise, and said, A SPLASH OF TOILET WATER AND A POLISH, MY GOOD MAN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn elderly wizard having a beard-trim on the other side stiffened when he heard those sombre, leaden tones and swung around. He blanched and muttered a few protective incantations after Death turned, very slowly for maximum effect, and treated him to a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, feeling rather self-conscious and chilly around the ears, Mort was heading back towards the stables where Death had lodged his horse. He tried an experimental swagger; he felt his new suit and haircut rather demanded it. It didn\u0027t quite work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort awoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay looking at the ceiling while his memory did a fast-rewind and the events of the previous day crystallised in his mind like little ice cubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t have met Death. He couldn\u0027t have eaten a meal with a skeleton with glowing blue eyes. It had to be a weird dream. He couldn\u0027t have ridden pillion on a great white horse that had cantered up into the sky and then went . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer flowed into his mind with all the inevitability of a tax demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis searching hands reached up to his cropped hair, and down to sheets of some smooth slippery material. It was much finer than the wool he was used to at home, which was coarse and always smelled of sheep; it felt like warm, dry ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung out of the bed hastily and stared around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all it was large, larger than the entire house back home, and dry, dry as old tombs under ancient deserts. The air tasted as though it had been cooked for hours and then allowed to cool. The carpet under his feet was deep enough to hide a tribe of pygmies and crackled electrically as he padded through it. And everything had been designed in shades of purple and black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at his own body, which was wearing a long white nightshirt. His clothes had been neatly folded on a chair by the bed; the chair, he couldn\u0027t help noticing, was delicately carved with a skull-and-bones motif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort sat down on the edge of the bed and began to dress, his mind racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased open the heavy oak door, and felt oddly disappointed when it failed to creak ominously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bare wooden corridor outside, with big yellow candles set in holders on the far wall. Mort crept out and sidled along the boards until he reached a staircase. He negotiated that successfully without anything ghastly happening, arriving in what looked like an entrance hall full of doors. There were a lot of funereal drapes here, and a grandfather clock with a tick like the heartbeat of a mountain. There was an umbrella stand beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had a scythe in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort looked around at the doors. They looked important. Their arches were carved in the now-familiar bones motif. He went to try the nearest one, and a voice behind him said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You mustn\u0027t go in there, boy.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him a moment to realise that this wasn\u0027t a voice in his head, but real human words that had been formed by a mouth and transferred to his ears by a convenient system of air compression, as nature intended. Nature had gone to a lot of trouble for six words with a slightly petulant tone to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around. There was a girl there, about his own height and perhaps a few years older than him. She had silver hair, and eyes with a pearly sheen to them, and the kind of interesting but impractical long dress that tends to be worn by tragic heroines who clasp single roses to their bosom while gazing soulfully at the moon. Mort had never heard the phrase \u0027Pre-Raphaelite\u0027, which was a pity because it would have been almost the right description. However, such girls tend to be on the translucent, consumptive side, whereas this one had a slight suggestion of too many chocolates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him with her head on one side, and one foot tapping irritably on the floor. Then she reached out quickly and pinched him sharply on the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ow!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hmm. So you\u0027re really real,\u0027 she said. \u0027What\u0027s your name, boy?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mortimer. They call me Mort,\u0027 he said, rubbing his elbow. \u0027What did you do that for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I shall call you Boy,\u0027 she said. \u0027And I don\u0027t really have to explain myself, you understand, but if you must know I thought you were dead. You look dead.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lost your tongue?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort was, in fact, counting to ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m not dead,\u0027 he said eventually. \u0027At least, I don\u0027t think so. It\u0027s a little hard to tell. Who are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You may call me Miss Ysabell,\u0027 she said haughtily. \u0027Father told me you must have something to eat. Follow me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swept away towards one of the other doors. Mort trailed behind her at just the right distance to have it swing back and hit his other elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a kitchen on the other side of the door – long, low and warm, with copper pans hanging from the ceiling and a vast black iron stove occupying the whole of one long wall. An old man was standing in front of it, frying eggs and bacon and whistling between his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell attracted Mort\u0027s taste buds from across the room, hinting that if they got together they could really enjoy themselves. He found himself moving forward without even consulting his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Albert,\u0027 snapped Ysabell, \u0027another one for breakfast.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned his head slowly, and nodded at her without saying a word. She turned back to Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I must say,\u0027 she said, \u0027that with the whole Disc to choose from, I should think Father could have done rather better than you. I suppose you\u0027ll just have to do.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swept out of the room, slamming the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have to do what?\u0027 said Mort, to no-one in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was silent, except for the sizzle of the frying pan and the crumbling of coals in the molten heart of the stove. Mort saw that it had the words \u0027The Little Moloch (Ptntd)\u0027 embossed on its oven door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cook didn\u0027t seem to notice him, so Mort pulled up a chair and sat down at the white scrubbed table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mushrooms?\u0027 said the old man, without looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hmm? What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I said, do you want mushrooms?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh. Sorry. No, thank you,\u0027 said Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right you are, young sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and set out for the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after he got used to it, Mort always held his breath when he watched Albert walking. Death\u0027s manservant was one of those stick-thin, raw-nosed old men who always look as though they are wearing gloves with the fingers cut out – even when they\u0027re not – and his walking involved a complicated sequence of movements. Albert leaned forward and his left arm started to swing, slowly at first but soon evolving into a wild jerking movement that finally and suddenly, at about the time when a watcher would have expected the arm to fly off at the elbow, transferred itself down the length of his body to his legs and propelled him forward like a high-speed stilt walker. The frying pan followed a series of intricate curves in the air and was brought to a halt just over Mort\u0027s plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbert did indeed have exactly the right type of half-moon spectacles to peer over the top of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There could be some porridge to follow,\u0027 he said, and winked, apparently to include Mort in the world porridge conspiracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Excuse me\u0027, said Mort, \u0027but where am I, exactly?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t you know? This is the house of Death, lad. He brought you here last night.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I – sort of remember. Only. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hmm?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well. The bacon and eggs,\u0027 said Mort, vaguely. \u0027It doesn\u0027t seem, well, appropriate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve got some black pudding somewhere,\u0027 said Albert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, I mean . . .\u0027 Mort hesitated. \u0027It\u0027s just that I can\u0027t see him sitting down to a couple of rashers and a fried slice.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbert grinned. \u0027Oh, he doesn\u0027t, lad. Not as a regular thing, no. Very easy to cater for, the master. I just cook for me and —\u0027 he paused – \u0027the young lady, of course.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort nodded. \u0027Your daughter,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mine? Ha,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027You\u0027re wrong there. She\u0027s his.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort stared down at his fried eggs. They stared back from their lake of fat. Albert had heard of nutritional values, and didn\u0027t hold with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are we talking about the same person?\u0027 he said at last. Tall, wears black, he\u0027s a bit . . . skinny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Adopted,\u0027 said Albert, kindly. \u0027It\u0027s rather a long story —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bell jangled by his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027— which will have to wait. He wants to see you in his study. I should run along if I were you. He doesn\u0027t like to be kept waiting. Understandable, really. Up the steps and first on the left. You can\u0027t miss it —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s got skulls and bones around the door?\u0027 said Mort, pushing back his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all have, most of them,\u0027 sighed Albert. \u0027It\u0027s only his fancy. He doesn\u0027t mean anything by it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving his breakfast to congeal, Mort hurried up the steps, along the corridor and paused in front of the first door. He raised his hand to knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eENTER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handle turned of its own accord. The door swung inward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath was seated behind a desk, peering intently into a vast leather book almost bigger than the desk itself. He looked up as Mort came in, keeping one calcareous finger marking his place, and grinned. There wasn\u0027t much of an alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAH, he said, and then paused. Then he scratched his chin, with a noise like a fingernail being pulled across a comb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHO ARE YOU, BOY?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mort, sir,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Your apprentice. You remember?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath stared at him for some time. Then the pinpoint blue eyes turned back at the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOH YES, he said, MORT. WELL, BOY, DO YOU SINCERELY WISH TO LEARN THE UTTERMOST SECRETS OF TIME AND SPACE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, sir. I think so, sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGOOD. THE STABLES ARE AROUND THE BACK. THE SHOVEL HANGS JUST INSIDE THE DOOR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down. He looked up. Mort hadn\u0027t moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIS IT BY ANY CHANCE POSSIBLE THAT YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND ME?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not fully, sir,\u0027 said Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDUNG, BOY. DUNG. ALBERT HAS A COMPOST HEAP IN THE GARDEN. I IMAGINE THERE\u0027S A WHEELBARROW SOMEWHERE ON THE PREMISES. GET ON WITH IT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort nodded mournfully. \u0027Yes, sir. I see, sir. Sir?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sir, I don\u0027t see what this has to do with the secrets of time and space.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath did not look up from his book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT, he said, is BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE TO LEARN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a fact that although the Death of the Discworld is, in his own words, an ANTHROPOMORPHIC PERSONIFICATION, he long ago gave up using the traditional skeletal horses, because of the bother of having to stop all the time to wire bits back on. Now his horses were always flesh-and-blood beasts, from the finest stock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, Mort learned, very well fed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome jobs offer increments. This one offered – well, quite the reverse, but at least it was in the warm and fairly easy to get the hang of. After a while he got into the rhythm of it, and started playing the private little quantity-surveying game that everyone plays in these circumstances. Let\u0027s see, he thought, I\u0027ve done nearly a quarter, let\u0027s call it a third, so when I\u0027ve done that corner by the hayrack it\u0027ll be more than half, call it five-eighths, which means three more wheelbarrow loads. . . . It doesn\u0027t prove anything very much except that the awesome splendour of the universe is much easier to deal with if you think of it as a series of small chunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse watched him from its stall, occasionally trying to eat his hair in a friendly sort of way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-4.html","bookId":1623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM"}
