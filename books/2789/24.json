I mean, she practically knocks my block off, makes it clear I\u0027m on her shit list, and she\u0027s been merciless with the teasing. Not to mention the prince is giving me the ole hairy eyeball every time we run into each other. So why didn\u0027t I get on a plane and go back to L.A.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Christina did not wish it, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah.\" He sighed. Sometimes he thought he\u0027d gone as cuckoo as the royal family. If he\u0027d half a brain he would have left as soon as the swelling went down. Instead, Chris insisted he stay, telling him the devil she knew was better, whatever the fuck that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd... if he was going to be 100 percent truthful... he stayed to redeem himself. To prove that he wasn\u0027t what she\u0027d said: a pussy hound with no conscience. That foxy Princess Alex had put a few moves on him, but he\u0027d treated her like she was radioactive. Her father wasn\u0027t just a big guy, he could, like, bomb California or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here he was, standing outside Christina\u0027s rooms with Edmund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund said loudly, \"We\u0027re coming in, my lady!\" and—whoa!—opened the door and walked in. Brave dude!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing Chris as well as he thought he did, Edmund tiptoed over to the head of the bed. \"My lady? It\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unffff, unfff,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt walked to the foot of the bed and pulled the comforter up, revealing Christina\u0027s sleep-lined face. \"Aaggh! I mean, good morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go \u0027way,\" she grumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund gingerly picked up the comforter on his end and gazed at her feet. \"I think, first, a pedicure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S\u0027not time t\u0027get up yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes it is, sunshine!\" Kurt flinched as her filmy gaze landed on him. \"Uh ... I forgot how... urn ... dewy fresh you look in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the hell up. Both of you pervs, get lost.\" She started to worm her way back under the bedclothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-ah-ah!\" he sang. \"You ignored your alarm clock, so Eds and I got the duty. It\u0027s time to get married!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite so, my lady, but we all have distasteful tasks we must attend to. Now come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it really,\" she sighed, \"April second? Already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Fraid so, cutie.\" From Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like I just got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" From Edmund. \"It seems like you\u0027ve been here an eternity. A joyful eternity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaddup. Where\u0027s David? Whyn\u0027t you go wake him up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His Highness has been up for four hours, my lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figures. Kurt, what the hell? Are you in here waking me up because you carry a sidearm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was specifically recruited for this hideously dangerous mission, yes,\" Kurt admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart of \u0027em,\" she said grudgingly, and tossed back the bedclothes, and stood, and yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men stepped back from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the future member of the royal family snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, my lady. You\u0027re as ... refreshing... as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Kurt added, \"except... could you go brush your teeth? Like, right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assholes,\" she grumbled, and stumbled toward the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina sat up abruptly, and the makeup artist nearly put her eye out with the eyeliner pencil. \"Wow! Alex, Kath, Jenn .. . you guys look awesome!\" Kathryn and Alex, doubtless used to looking unbelievably, mouthwateringly gorgeous, just shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny blushed to her hairline. The dresses Horrance had designed set off the women\u0027s coloring superbly ... all three had dark hair, and Kathryn and Alex had the Baranov blue eyes. Jenny\u0027s big, dark eyes seemed to swallow up half her face, and she was very white. Even for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenn, why don\u0027t you sit down before you fall down? You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, my lady. It\u0027s just... there are several details ... my list... I must find my list...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Siddown,\" Alex said, while Kathryn looked on with concern. \"Naomi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA maid poked her head into the dressing room. \"Highness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Jenny something to drink and something for her stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At once, Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lady... if you could please sit still...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay.\" Christina slumped back. It was extremely weird to be fussed over by a stranger while she was sitting in her underwear. Well, at least Edmund wasn\u0027t doing her makeup. \"I don\u0027t see why we have to do this, anyway. I\u0027m perfectly capable of putting on my own makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you even know,\" Alex said, smirking, \"which end of a mascara wand goes on your lashes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ohhhh, that\u0027s so funny I forgot to laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\" Alex muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The minister wants to talk to you,\" Kathryn added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina nearly fell out of her chair. Kathyrn spoke! Without hurling eye shadow! It truly was a historic occasion. \"Well, he can\u0027t. I\u0027m in a damn bustier and panties and thigh-high stockings. He can just wait until I\u0027ve got a few more clothes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a man of God,\" Kathryn said. \"He wouldn\u0027t give a shit if you had a rose in your teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man of God, not eunuch. Besides, David gets weird about stuff like that. And your father! Cripes, don\u0027t get me started. And my, aren\u0027t we chatty today? What\u0027s gotten into you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Kathryn considered carefully, \"it appears you\u0027re going to be here awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so now I\u0027m worthy of speech, huh? That\u0027s just—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close your mouth, please,\" the makeup gal said, and she obliged, and submitted to lip-liner. It gave her a chance to study Kathryn. Of all the royal siblings, she knew Kathryn and her brother, Alexander, the least. Because, of course, they were the most like David: stand-offish and cool. Pleasant (when she wasn\u0027t throwing pastries), but distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathryn was a smaller, slighter version of her sister Alexandria. Currently mired in her teens, she was a breath away from the promise of true gorgeousness. Once those braces came off, Chris figured the king would start stockpiling rifles. Meanwhile, it couldn\u0027t be much fun to be in Princess Alex\u0027s shadow. Maybe that\u0027s why she didn\u0027t talk much, Chris mused. With everybody busy staring at her big sister, why bother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And... done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she said, practically leaping up from the chair. \"I can\u0027t remember the last time I had to sit still for so long. Oh, wait... yesterday. For rehearsal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rap at the door, and then Horrance was striding in, followed by three assistants, all lugging a flat black bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, my lady! Your Highnesses,\" he added, bowing to Kathryn and Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horrance, take a powder. I\u0027m not dressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh? No, of course not, I\u0027ve got your dress right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That looks like a body bag,\" she said suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can assure you it isn\u0027t.\" He scooted behind Alex—he was a full four inches shorter—and did something to the back of her dress. Alex\u0027s neckline immediately straightened. \"Ah ... much better, Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dresses really were amazing, Christina thought. The deep blue brought out the princess\u0027s eyes (although, unfortunately, it was also accentuating Jenny\u0027s pallor), and the square necklines were very flattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice jewelry,\" she commented. Her bridesmaids were all wearing square blue topazes on gold chains so fine, it seemed like the large stones were hovering in the hollow of their throats. Their earrings were smaller topazes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David designed them for us,\" Kathryn said absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. He\u0027s got something for you, too— ow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Alex said. \"My elbow slipped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right into my ribs, thanks very much.\" She glared at her big sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit it, you guys,\" Chris ordered. \"One bitch per wedding, that\u0027s the rule. And it\u0027s me, in case you didn\u0027t get the memo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least we read the memos,\" Kathryn sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaddup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sounded exactly like my father when you said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awwww. Now you\u0027re gonna make me cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathryn dropped the faux world-weary pose and snickered. Horrance clapped his hands, which made Chris jump. Thank God the makeup lady had put the mascara wand away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies! Step back, please, we need some room here. Ah, that\u0027s very good. Now, my lady, if you\u0027ll just stand and turn ... like so ... yes, a little more ... uh-huh ... okay ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you not get so close to me?\" she whined. \"I\u0027m nearly naked, if you didn\u0027t notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh? Oh, it doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ... you didn\u0027t notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now turn—wait!\" He slipped two impersonal fingers into her bodice and jerked it up, nearly pulling her off her feet. Day-amn! He was short, but he was strong. \"Much better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you please,\" she asked politely, \"get your hand off my boobs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes. Now turn ... very good ... and step ... like so... yes... now stand still... ladies, some help, please ... yes ... no, not that one, the little buttonhook ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buttonhook?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t think I was going to put a zipper into this dress, did you?\" he replied, sounding aggrieved. She could feel him doing something behind her with his nimble fingers. It seemed she stood for an eternity until he finally said, \"And ... there. Very good—turn around, please ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back and looked her up and down with a critical eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like an extra in Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\" she commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful, wonderful show,\" Horrance said absently. \"Yes. That will do.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-24.html","bookId":2789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM"}
