At the same time I know he\u0027s never going to give away the secret he\u0027s been holding inside. That fierce, protective spirit is a part of him, a bond he can\u0027t break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going? When will you be back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking into his serious, sad eyes, I know he means what he\u0027s saying. My eyes start to water and tears roll down my cheeks. \"You can\u0027t leave me. Not now.\" I want to beg and plead and cry and grab him until he changes his mind. I want to play tennis with him today, and tomorrow, and the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently swipes my tears with his fingers. \"Then come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tables have cruelly turned. I tell him, \"I realized you were right. It\u0027s a copout to leave. I\u0027m going to stay in Paradise until I graduate, and save the money Mrs. Reynolds gave me for college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Becker, you comin or not?\" the guy in the car calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb nods and says, \"Yeah, I\u0027m coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean in and touch his forehead to mine. \"Tell me what we had was real,\" I whisper. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u0027s hands lightly clasp my head on both sides, enclosing us into our own private world. \"As real as it gets. Don\u0027t ever question that, no matter what. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now I\u0027m questioning everything. Why did I even come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re ready to start a new life, Maggie. You\u0027re free of the past now. It can\u0027t hurt you. For me, being free means leaving Paradise.\" Leaning in, he kisses me. So soft and full of warmth and longing and remorse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to grab him and keep him safe. \"Does that mean we\u0027re both free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, unable to put it into words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he\u0027ll never write or call. He\u0027s going to cut all ties with his family and this little town that\u0027s caused him so much grief. Including me. God, how I wish Caleb never pled guilty to hitting me. Although if the accident had never happened, if he\u0027d never gone to jail and been stuck doing community service, Caleb and I might never have been together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t have changed that for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps back and winks at me. \"Bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to say it back to you, you know,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives a short laugh and keeps retreating backwards. \"Then tell me something I can remember as your last words to me. Tell me you love me. Tell me you\u0027ll think of me every night before you sleep. Tell me--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The red hen has flown the coop\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. \"I\u0027ll always remember Mrs. Reynolds, the gazebo, the daffodils, you and me in the gazebo ...\" Caleb winks at me one more time and turns around, his back to me as he walks to the Toyota. I want to scream at him for leaving me. I want to run up to him and forget being sane. Let us live in the streets together. As long as we\u0027re a team, nothing can bring us lower than we were apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he never did tell me it was Leah who hit me. He\u0027s the one who, in the end, didn\u0027t trust me ... or himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sobbing now, more than I did after the accident. And my heart hurts, more pain oozing from it than my leg ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" I yell right before he slides into the passenger seat and closes the car door. I hold my breath, waiting for him to come back to me. To turn around. But he doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car screeches away, its red lights a blur through my watery eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head back home and some time during the ride I stop crying. There\u0027s strength within me that I didn\u0027t know existed before. It\u0027s as if Mrs. Reynolds is nudging me to stay strong. Life is too short, she\u0027d once said. She was right. As I pull into my driveway and get out of my car, I notice Leah. She\u0027s standing in the front doorway of her house, her eyes puffy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to her. \"Is your mom okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"I guess. Your mom\u0027s with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it\u0027s a step in the right direction. It\u0027s about time we mended that invisible fence. I look up at my old best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw him, didn\u0027t you?\" she asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe holds her arm over her eyes and starts to sob. \"I need to tell you something really, really important. But I can\u0027t look at you while I do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take her arm and lower it. \"You don\u0027t have to tell me right now,\" I say. \"When you\u0027re ready, we can talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to hate me, Maggie. For the rest of your life you\u0027re going to hate me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to hate you. I know, Leah. I know what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" she says, all glassy-eyed. \"Yeah. But it\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say our friendship means more to me than holding a grudge or living in the past. You know what always helps me forget?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pie run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah gives me a small smile behind her tears. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Come with me for a drive to Auntie Mae\u0027s. Let\u0027s get our moms ... I think they need some pie, too.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-31.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
