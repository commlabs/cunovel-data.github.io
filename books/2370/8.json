Police Judiciaire?we need to talk?Tour Eiffel.. suicide note?Mark is dead?Mark is dead?Mark is dead. The words became a dirge pulsing through Kelly\u0027s brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see Mark\u0027s body tumbling down, down, down?She put her arms out to catch him just before he smashed against the sidewalk. Did you die because of me? Was it something I did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething I didn\u0027t do? Something I said? Something I didn\u0027t say? I was asleep when you left, darling, and I didn\u0027t have a chance to say good-bye, to kiss you and tell you how much I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need you. I can\u0027t stand it without you, Kelly thought. Help me, Mark. Help me-the way you always helped me?She slumped back, remembering how it had been before Mark, in the awful early days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY HAD BEEN born in Philadelphia, the illegitimate daughter of Ethel Hackworth, a black maid who worked for one of the town\u0027s most prominent white families. The father of the family was a judge. Ethel was seventeen and beautiful, and Pete, the handsome, blond, twenty-year-old son of the Turner family, had been attracted to her. He had seduced her, and a month later Ethel learned she was pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she told Pete, he said, \"That\u0027s-that\u0027s wonderful.\" And he rushed into his father\u0027s den to tell him the bad news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Turner called Ethel into his den the next morning and said, \"I won\u0027t have a whore working in this house. You\u0027re fired.\" With no money and no education or skills, Ethel had taken a job as a cleaning lady in an industrial building, working long hours to support her newborn daughter. In five years, Ethel had saved enough money to buy a run-down clapboard house that she turned into a boardinghouse for men. Ethel converted the rooms into a living room, a dining room, four small bedrooms, and a narrow little utility room that Kelly slept in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that time on, a series of men constantly arrived and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are your uncles,\" Ethel told her. \"Don\u0027t bother them.\" Kelly was pleased that she had such a large family until she became old enough to realize that they were all strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kelly was eight years old, she was asleep one night in her small, darkened bedroom when she was awakened by a guttural whisper: \"Shhh! Don\u0027t make a sound.\" Kelly felt her nightgown being lifted, and before she could protest, one of her \"uncles\" was on top of her and his hand was over her mouth. Kelly could feel him forcibly spreading her legs. She tried to struggle, but he held her down. She felt his member tearing inside her body, and she was filled with excruciating pain. He was merciless, forcing himself inside her, going deeper and deeper, rubbing her skin raw. Kelly could feel her warm blood gushing out. She was silently screaming, afraid she would faint. She was trapped in the terrifying blackness of her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, she felt him shudder and then withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered, \"I\u0027m leaving. But if you ever tell your mother about this, I\u0027ll come back and kill her.\" And he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next week was almost unbearable. She was in misery all the time, but she treated her lacerated body as best she could until finally the pain subsided. She wanted to tell her mother what had happened, but she did not dare. If you ever tell your mother about this, I\u0027ll come back and kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident had lasted only a few minutes, but those few minutes altered Kelly\u0027s life. She changed from a young girl who had dreamed of having a husband and children to someone who felt that she was tarnished and disgraced. She resolved that she would never let a man touch her again. Something else had changed in Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that night on, she was afraid of the dark.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-8.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
