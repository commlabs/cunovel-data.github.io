I don’t know what I would have done without him today. “You’re the best, Lindy,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex gives an embarrassed shrug and says, “It’s nothing.” He points at me. “Hey, you’re slowing down the assembly line.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he leaves, Nadia helps me clean up and pack away the leftover candy. She doesn’t look at me when she says, “Alex likes you, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my mouth to deny it, but I stop myself. I can’t lie to Nadi, but I don’t know what the truth is anymore. So all I say is, “We’re friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia makes a show of rolling her eyes at me. “So do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like him?” The expression on her face—a little bit plaintive, but mostly trying not to care. It breaks my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you?” I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a pause, I can see her thinking this over. “No,” she tells me. “He’s—nice. He’s so nice. But I don’t like him like that anymore. I did. For maybe a second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach out and touch Nadi’s hair. It’s so soft, like a baby’s. She lets me for a second before shrugging away. She says, “Be nice to him, okay? Don’t hurt him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t,” I say. In my head I add, not again. That’s a promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, when we ran into each other in the hall, Lillia mentioned how she’d asked some of her guy friends if they could help her sort through the sound equipment and drive it over to the elementary school. It’s for her Fall Festival night, the event she’s running for the elementary school kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia said that even though she’d asked really, really nicely, Reeve blew her off. “He said he had to go to PT and was too busy. I told him it would take like, ten minutes after school, but he still said no. He said he wanted to get to the gym early and lift weights!” Lillia had looked ready to cry. “The other guys have practice. It’s going to take me forever to load up my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudi, I’ll have to make like five trips back and forth!” “Lil! I’ll totally help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia’s whole face brightened up. “Thank you so much,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary.” So now I’m scurrying over to the side entrance by the theater. I’m not very strong, but with two of us it should go a little bit faster anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of fighting the after-school rush inside, I cut across the back parking lot—which is when I see Alex’s SUV parked by the side door right behind Lillia’s Audi. He’s already there, taking boxes out of her trunk and loading them into his. The back door is open, and Lillia comes out the door, wearing an ivory-colored coat and a long scarf around her neck, struggling with a big cardboard box. Alex rushes over to help her. She must not expect him, because he startles her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex!” she says, looking up. “Oh my gosh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang back and watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex takes the box out of her hands. “Here, Lil. You don’t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to get your coat dirty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got it,” she insists, and he tries to take it from her, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey both laugh because she almost drops it. “You have to get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto practice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give it to me,” he says, but in a sweet way. Lillia finally lets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe box go. I think Alex is surprised at how heavy it is. It almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efalls out of his hands, but he adjusts his grip before it can. Meanwhile, Lillia scans the parking lot. I step forward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand smile, but she waves her hand, like I don’t have to worry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she says breathlessly, when Alex lifts his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are only three more inside.” She turns to go back into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe theater door, but Alex stops her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait here. I’ll get them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia leans against the car. The wind has picked up, and her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair is blowing around her face. “I owe you one, Lindy!” she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecalls out. “Thank you so much!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to back away, and that’s when I notice it—about fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeet away to my left, Reeve, pulling up in his truck. He’s seen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem too. He has a scowl on his face, and he puts the truck in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereverse. He’s gone before they even notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get home, Aunt Bette’s Volvo isn’t in the driveway. And I hate to say it, but it’s kind of a relief. I’ve been meaning to have a conversation about her with my parents, but it’s scary. My mom is Aunt Bette’s sister, after all. I don’t want to get her mad, or have her confronting Aunt Bette over what I’d say. I wish I could tell someone about how strangely Aunt Bette’s been acting. I’ve never been afraid of my aunt. I’m still not. I’m just . . . worried about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my book bag down in the kitchen and head upstairs, calling her name a few times in case she’s home. She’s so easily startled lately. I’ve been trying to be careful with her, give her space. I don’t want to make things worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of the stairs, I notice Aunt Bette’s bedroom door is open the skinniest crack. She’s been keeping it closed. I walk up slowly and peek inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are books all over the floor. At least a hundred of them, piled in teetering stacks on top of Aunt Bette’s Moroccan rug. Musty, cloth-covered books. The kind that sit and gather dust at the library. The kind that you find at a garage sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step inside, careful not to touch anything, because I have a pretty good feeling that Aunt Bette would lose her mind if she knew I was poking around her room. I crouch down and try to read some of the spines, but most of the titles aren’t written in English. It looks like maybe Latin. And some Spanish, which reminds me that I am so far behind in Señor Tremont’s class it’s not even funny. There are a few books split open, but to pages that don’t have any words. Only, like, hieroglyphics. Symbols and numbers that make no sense to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Bette’s Volvo putters into the driveway. I jump up and turn to head out the bedroom door. That’s when I notice the shared wall that separates Aunt’s Bette’s bedroom from mine. The one to the right of her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt used to be a wall full of art. Pictures. Paintings. Photographs. But everything’s been taken down, except for the tiny nails left in the wall. Even Aunt Bette’s dresser, the low four-drawer one that sat against the wall, has been pushed aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole thing is stripped bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least I think it is. But when I take a step closer, I see that Aunt Bette has laced string, string the very same color as the eggshell wall paint, around the picture nails. I think it might even be the same stuff she used to wrap those smudge bundles. She’s woven them into some kind of pattern. Like a lopsided, crooked star. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fire-with-fire-burn-for-burn-2/page-17.html","bookId":2727,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:21:33 PM"}
