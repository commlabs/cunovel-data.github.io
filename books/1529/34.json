Despite what Devesh claimed, Lisa knew the Guild\u0027s operation was not motivated by altruistic reasons. Their search for a cure was not to save the world. They had plans for this virus, but before they could utilize it, they needed to fully understand it. To develop an antidote or cure. And in this regard, Lisa was not at cross-purposes with the Guild. A cure needed to be discovered. The only question: How to find it without the Guild\u0027s knowledge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh turned on a heel and headed toward the door. \"You\u0027ve made excellent progress, Dr. Cummings. I commend you. But tomorrow is another day. And we\u0027ll need more progress.\" He glanced back at her, one eyebrow raised. \"Is that understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most excellent.\" He paused again. \"Oh, and our cruise ship\u0027s esteemed owner, Sir Ryder Blunt, has invited everyone for afternoon cocktails in his suite. A small celebration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celebration for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A welcome as we come into port,\" Devesh explained, gathering up his cane. \"We\u0027re almost home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa was in no mood to toast such an event. \"I have much work here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense. You\u0027ll come. It won\u0027t take long, and it will help recharge your batteries. Yes, the matter is settled. I\u0027ll have Rakao escort you. Please wear something appropriate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left, Surina trailing in his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa shook her head as they departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Dr. Susan Tunis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the woman\u0027s husband and for what was to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa remembered her earlier comparisons to the patient, how their two lives had followed similar paths. She pictured Susan\u0027s husband, wild-eyed and feral. Reminded of her own love, she hugged her arms around herself and wished for the thousandth time that she was back home with Painter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had spoken to him again this morning. At another of their assigned debriefings. She knew better than to attempt any subterfuge this time, reporting all was well. Still, she had been in tears by the time she was yanked from the radio room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted his arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was only one way to make that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed to the tray of examination tools and picked up the ophthalmoscope. Before she proceeded to the cocktail party, she wanted to follow up with an aberration, something she had kept from Devesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that was surely impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:02 A.M. Washington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne step behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter descended the stairs two at a time toward the lobby of the Phoenix Park Hotel, too impatient even to wait for the elevator. A Sigma forensic team was still a floor above, sweeping room 334. He had left a pair of FBI field agents arguing with the local authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pissing contest for jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, Painter doubted any solid evidence would be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour ago he had been woken from a catnap in the dormitory of Sigma Command. One of their tracers had finally hit. An order for a prescription refill for Jackson Pierce. The Social Security number had matched. It was the first hit since Gray and company had fled the firebombed safe house. Painter had tagged all of Gray\u0027s aliases, along with his parents\u0027 names, coordinated through NSA\u0027s tracking network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had sent out an emergency response team to the pharmacy while joining another team headed to the delivery address on the prescription. The Phoenix Park Hotel. The pharmacy had confirmed the order, but the delivery person had not yet returned. An attempt to reach him by cell phone had so far failed. The pharmacy had even tried calling the hotel, but no one picked up at the extension for the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon arriving here, Painter learned why. The room was deserted. Whoever was here had already bolted. The register was signed under Fred and Ginger Rogers, an elderly couple according to the desk clerk. They had checked in alone. And paid cash. Gray was apparently not with them. Besides which, Gray would not have made such a blatant mistake, ordering a refill, triggering an alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if so, what made his parents make such a risky move? Harriet was a bright woman. The need must have been dire. So why didn\u0027t they wait? What made them cut and run? Was it meant merely to misdirect? To send them all along a false trail?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter knew better. Gray would not use his parents like that. He would get them to hole up anonymously and lay low. Nothing more. Something was wrong here. No one had seen the elderly couple leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was the question of the missing deliveryman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter shoved through the stairwell door and into the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night manager nodded to him, wringing his hands. \"I have the security footage from the lobby pulled and waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter was led into the manager\u0027s back office. A television with a built-in VCR stood atop a filing cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Key it to an hour ago,\" Painter said, checking his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager started the tape and fast-forwarded to the time-stamped hour. The lobby was deserted, except for a lone woman behind the desk, seated doing paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louise,\" the manager introduced, tapping the screen. \"She\u0027s quite shook up by all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter ignored his commentary, leaning closer to the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lobby door swung open, and a figure in a white smock strode to the front desk, presented an ID, and stepped toward the elevator bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise returned to her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did your night clerk ever see the delivery person leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can ask . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter paused the tape as the figure adjusted the smock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the pharmacy\u0027s man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security footage was grainy, but the woman\u0027s Asian features were evident. Painter recognized her. He had seen her on the video surveillance back at the safe house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Nasser\u0027s team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter punched the eject button and grabbed the tape. He swung around so fast that the startled manager backed away a step. Painter held up the security tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows about this,\" he said firmly, fixing the manager with a steady stare, doing his best to look threatening, and considering his mood, it wasn\u0027t hard. \"Not the police. Not the FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter headed out the door, clenching a fist, wanting to pound something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter understood what had happened here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser had snatched Gray\u0027s parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut from under their noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bastard had beat Sigma by only minutes. And Painter could not blame any mole for losing this particular race. He knew the reason. Bureaucracy. Seichan\u0027s background as a terrorist had everyone on full alert, which meant everyone was stepping on everyone else\u0027s toes. Too many goddamn cooks in the kitchen . . . and all of them blindfolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Nasser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll day long Painter had been running into roadblocks, mostly due to bureaucratic territoriality. With Sigma under a government oversight review, other agencies tasted the blood in the water. Whoever could nab the Guild turncoat, the big fish amid all the chum, could almost guarantee some security. As such, there was little true cooperation, more a nod in its general direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Painter had any hope of thwarting Nasser, he needed to cut the red tape binding his wrists. There was only one way to do that. He pulled out his cell phone. To hell with diplomacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a button and speed-dialed to Central Command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line was picked up by Painter\u0027s aide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brant, I need you to patch me through to Director McKnight at DARPA. On a secure line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly, sir. But I was just about to call you in the field. Communications just patched up some strange news. About Christmas Island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for Painter to switch gears. \"What\u0027s happened?\" he asked after a steadying breath. He paused before the hotel\u0027s revolving door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Details are sketchy. But it appears the cruise ship used to evacuate the island was hijacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he gasped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the WHO scientists was able to escape. He used a shortwave radio to reach a passing tanker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lisa and Monk .. . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No news, but details are flooding in now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart pounding, he signed off, pocketed the phone, and pushed through the revolving door. The cool air did little to take the heat out of his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran over his last conversation with her in his head. She had sounded tired, maybe a tad on edge, wired from lack of sleep. Had she been forced to make those calls?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would have the audacity to hijack an entire cruise ship? Surely they must know word would get out. Especially in the age of satellite surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nowhere to hide a ship this size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:48 P.M. Aboard the Mistress of the Seas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk gaped at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Jesus . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stood on the starboard deck, alone, waiting for Jessie. A mist-shrouded island rose directly ahead. Cliffs climbed steeply out of the ocean, offering no beach or safe harbor, topped by jagged peaks. The whole place looked like an ancient stone crown, draped in vine and jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt appeared especially ominous backlit by the black skies behind it. The cruise ship had been outrunning a storm. Off in the distance, patches of dark rain brushed from the low clouds and swept the whitecapped ocean. The winds had picked up, snapping flags and gusting with shoves to the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk kept one hand clamped to the rail as the large boat rolled in the rising storm surges, taxing the ship\u0027s stabilizers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was the captain thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir speeds had slowed, but their course remained dead-on. Straight toward the inhospitable island. It looked no more welcoming than the hundreds they\u0027d already passed. What made this one so special?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver resourceful and fluent, Jessie had ascertained some details about the island, from one of the ship\u0027s cooks, a native of the region, who recognized the place. The island was called Pusat, or Navel. According to the cook, boats avoided the place. Supposedly the Balinese witch queen Rangda was born out of this navel, and her demons still protect her birthplace, beasts who rose out of the deep to drag the unsuspecting down to her watery underworld. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-34.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
