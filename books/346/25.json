His social position as the son of a rich manufacturer insured him a cordial welcome and great attention from the whole family. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You must find our village very dull, Mr. Cameron,” said his host.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, no, sir; I think I shall enjoy it very well.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We have very little good society, I am sorry to say.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s so, father,” broke in James. “I wish you would move to the city.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That may come some day,” said his father, thinking of Mr. Temple and his operations.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How do you occupy your time, Mr. Cameron?” asked Mrs. Leech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I walk about in the forenoon. In the afternoon I am occupied with my professor,” answered the young man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your professor!” repeated the lady, in surprise. “Is one of your college professors staying here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; they are too busy to leave New Haven. I refer to my young reader, Herbert Carter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Herbert Carter!” repeated James, scornfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said Cameron, ignoring the scorn; “he reads my lessons to me and then questions me upon them. That is why I call him my professor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should hardly think you would find him competent,” said the squire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He don\u0027t know much,” said James, contemptuously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “On the contrary, I find him very intelligent. He reads clearly and distinctly, and I congratulate myself on obtaining so satisfactory an assistant.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Squire Leech shrugged his shoulders and had too much wisdom to continue detracting from Herbert\u0027s merits, seeing that his guest seemed determined to think well of him. Not so James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is from a low family,” he said, spitefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Low?” interrogated Cameron, significantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “His mother is very poor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s a very different thing,” observed Cameron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mrs. Carter is a very respectable person,” said the squire, condescendingly. “Indeed, I have offered to relieve her by taking her house at a high valuation; but, under a mistaken idea of her own interest, she refuses to sell.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But you\u0027ll get it finally, father,” asked James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall probably have to take it in the end, as I have a mortgage on it for nearly its value.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cameron looked down upon his plate and said nothing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My son will be happy to accompany you about the neighborhood, Mr. Cameron,” said Squire Leech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can go round with you \u0027most any time,” said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you both. You are very kind,” said Cameron, politely, but without expressing any pleasure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I may send James to Yale,” observed his host, “I have a high idea of your college, Mr. Cameron.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you. I think your son could hardly fail of deriving benefit from a residence at Yale.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “James is my only child and I intend him to enjoy the greatest educational advantages. I should like to have him become a professional man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should like to be a lawyer; that\u0027s a very gentlemanly profession,” said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You might rise to be a judge,” said Cameron, with a smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very likely,” said James, in a matter-of-course way, that amused the young man exceedingly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What an odious young cub!” he said to himself, as he wended his way back to the hotel at ten o\u0027clock. “I never met such a combination of pride and self-conceit.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n James thought Cameron had taken a fancy to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He must get awfully tired of that low-bred Herbert Carter,” he said to himself. “I guess I\u0027ll go round tomorrow morning and take a walk with him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He met Cameron on the steps of the hotel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought I\u0027d come and walk with you,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well,” said Cameron. “Do you know the way to Mr. Crane\u0027s?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The carpenter\u0027s?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s nothing to see there,” said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I beg your pardon. I want to see Herbert at his work.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, well, I\u0027ll show you the way,” said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert was hard at work when the two came up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How are you, professor?” asked Cameron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, Mr. Cameron. How are you, James?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m well enough,” answered James, who always found it hard to be decently civil to our hero. “Don\u0027t you get tired working?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I haven\u0027t worked long enough this morning for that. I dare say I shall be tired before noon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then your other work will begin,” said Cameron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That kind of work will be a rest to me, it\u0027s so different.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you had an extra hoe I would help you a little. It would be as good as exercise in the gymnasium.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps I could borrow two and so employ both of you,” remarked Herbert, with a glance at James, who was sprucely dressed and wore a flower in his buttonhole.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “None for me, thank you,” said James, with a look of disgust. “I don\u0027t intend to become a laborer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027ll have to labor if you study law,” said Cameron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s genteel; besides I don\u0027t call it labor. Shall we go on, Mr. Cameron?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not just yet. I want to watch Herbert a little longer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he lingered, much to the dissatisfaction of James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Won\u0027t you go out rowing?” he asked, when they were walking away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have no objection,” said Cameron; and they spent an hour on the pond.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think I can get into the crew if I go to Yale?” asked James, complacently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should say not, unless you improve in rowing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t I row well?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There is considerable room for improvement. However, you have time enough for that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were cruising near the shore when a boy of ten came down to the bank and called out to them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “James,” he said, “will you let me go across in the boat with you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why should I?” demanded James, not very amicably, for the boy belonged to what he termed the lower classes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do let me,” urged the boy. “I left mother very sick and went for the doctor. She was all alone and I want to get back as soon as I can.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the road the boy would have to walk about a mile and a quarter, while he could be rowed across the pond in six or seven minutes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can\u0027t take anybody and everybody in my boat,” said James, disagreeably. “Go ahead and walk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How can you refuse the boy, when he wants to get home to his sick mother?” said Cameron, indignantly. “Jump in, my boy, and we\u0027ll take you over.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know about that,” said James, sullenly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look here!” said Cameron, shortly. “Refuse this boy and I shall get out of the boat immediately and refuse hereafter to be seen in your company.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n James was disagreeably surprised.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jump in, my boy,” said Cameron, kindly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir,” said the boy, gratefully. James was not a little mortified at the snubbing he had received, but he did not venture to expostulate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cameron was fond of boating, but did not care to be indebted to James for the loan of his boat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll have a boat sent on to me,” he secretly determined, “and when I leave Wrayburn I\u0027ll give it to Herbert.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82064.html","bookId":346,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:05:13 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 1:35:44 PM"}
