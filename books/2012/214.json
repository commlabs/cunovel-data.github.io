The rope that had killed him was horsehair – I remember how people talked about that, as if it was important, though I didn’t know why at the time. But they’d found horsehairs in Gin’s neck .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old women who shared a house on the corner, three of them, seemed to be looking at us again and again – we were outside, listening to everybody talking, all those emotions running high. Ma was white as plucked down. Da was on the bench beside the shack’s door. He’d gotten a rash on his hands and was slowly melting a lump of lard between them. There’d been a strange look in his eye, but for once he wasn’t offering any opinion on the matter .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorsehair. A tradition among the outliers, the wood-cutting camps east of the city. ‘How adulterers are hung, aye?’ And the old women nodded. ‘But old Ginanse, he ain’t never—’ ‘No, couldn’t, y’see? Got burned down there – was on a ship that caught fire when they took Falar Harbour. He couldn’t do nothing .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drunk seducer with nowhere to take it. How shit-fouled miserable is that? Breaks the heart .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he’d always a kind word for Ma, when she went to him to get the one knife we owned sharpened. Hardly charged a thing either. ‘That blade a mouse couldn’t shave with, hah! Hey, boy, your ma ever let you shave a mouse? Good practice for when one shows up under yer nose! Few years yet, though .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ So,’ said someone in the crowd, ‘a jealous man – no, make it a jealous, stupid man. With wood for brains.’ And a few people laughed, but they weren’t pleasant laughs. People were working up to something. People knew something. People were figuring it out .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a bird in a thorn bush, Ma slipped inside without a sound. I followed her, thinking about poor old Ginanse and wondering who was gonna sharpen Ma’s knife now. But Da got up right then and went in a step before me. His hands were dripping melted fat .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t remember exactly what I saw. Just a flash, really. Up close to Da’s face, just under his huge, bearded jaw. And he made a gurgling sound and his knees bent as if he was about to sit down – right on me. I jumped back, tripped in the doorway and landed in the dust beside the bench .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDa was making spitting sounds, but not from his mouth. From his neck. And when he landed on his knees, twisting round in the doorway as if wanting to come back outside, the front of his chest was all wet and bright red. I looked into my father’s eyes. And for the first and only time in my life with him, I actually saw something alive in there. A flicker, a gleam, that went out for good as he slumped on the threshold .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Ma stood holding that little knife in her right hand .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Here y’go, boy, hold it careful now. It’s sharp enough to shave a mouse – Bridgeburner magic, what I can do with decent iron. Give us another smile, sweet Elade, it’s all the payment I ask, darling .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Well now, recruit, y’ever stand still? Seen you goin’ round and round and round. Tell me, was your old man a court clown or something? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Master-Sergeant, my da was a wood-cutter .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Really? Outlier blood? But you’re a scrawny thing for a wood-cutter’s son. Not one for the trade then? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe died when I was seven, Master-Sergeant. I was of no mind to follow his ways. I ended up learning most from my ma’s side of the family – had an aunt and uncle who worked with animals .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Found you a name, lad .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster-Sergeant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ See, I wrote it right here, making it official. Your name is Widdershins, and you’re now a marine. Now get out of my sight – and get someone to beat those dogs. That barking’s driving me mad .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How’s the stomach, Wid?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Burns like coals, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half-dozen regulars were coming up alongside them. The one in the lead eyed Balm and said, ‘Fist Blistig assigned us t’this one, Sergeant. We got it in hand—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Best under a blanket, Corporal,’ said Balm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter piped an eerie laugh, and the squad of regulars jumped at the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your help’s always welcome,’ Balm added. ‘But from now on, these wagons got details of marines to help guard ’em.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corporal looked nervous enough for Widdershins to give him a closer look. Now that’s an awfully plump face for someone on three tiny cups a day .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corporal was stubborn or stupid enough to try again. ‘Fist Blistig—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ain’t commanding marines, Corporal. But tell you what, go to him and tell him all about this conversation, why don’t you? If he’s got a problem he can come to me. I’m Sergeant Balm, Ninth Squad. Or, if I rank too low for him on all this, why, he can hunt down Captain Fiddler, who’s up ahead, on point.’ Balm cocked his head and scratched his jaw. ‘Seem to recall, from my basic training days, that a Fist outranks a captain – hey, Deadsmell, is that right?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-214.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
