You wanted her apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look around you,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve already got an apartment. Ground floor, no stairs to climb. What did I need with hers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spent a lot of time downtown today. Most of the morning and a good part of the afternoon. It\u0027s hard to chase things through the municipal record system, but if you know how to do it and what you\u0027re looking for, there\u0027s a lot you can find out. I found out who owns this building. An outfit called Daskap Realty Corp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could have told you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also found out who owns Daskap. A woman named Wilma Rosser. I don\u0027t suppose it would be terribly hard to prove that Wilma Rosser and Willa Rossiter are the same person. You bought the building and moved in, but you told everybody that you were just the super, that you got the apartment in return for your services.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to do that,\" she said. \"No landlord can live on the premises unless you hide the fact from your tenants. Otherwise they\u0027re after you all the time for one thing or another. I had to be able to shrug and say the landlord says no or I can\u0027t reach the landlord or whatever I had to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been tough,\" I said. \"Trying to generate a positive cash flow here, with all of the tenants paying rent way below market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is tough,\" she admitted. \"The woman you mentioned, Gertrude Grod. She was rent-controlled, of course. Her annual rent came to less than what it cost to heat her place during the winter. But you can\u0027t believe I\u0027d kill her because of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her among others. You don\u0027t own just this building. You\u0027re the principal in two other corporations besides Daskap. One of them, also owned ultimately by Wilma Rosser, owns the building next door. Another, owned by W. P. Taggart, owns two buildings across the street, the ones where you\u0027re the superintendent. Wilma P. Rosser was divorced from Elroy Hugh Taggart three years ago in New Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got in the habit of using different names. My political background and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The buildings across the street have been a very unsafe place to live since you bought them. Five people have died over there in the past year and a half. One was a suicide. They found her with her head in the oven. The rest all died of natural causes. Heart attacks, respiratory failure. When frail old people die alone, no one looks too hard to see what did it. You can smother an old man in his sleep, you can haul an old lady across the floor and leave her with her head in the gas oven. That\u0027s a little dangerous because there\u0027s always the possibility of an explosion, and you wouldn\u0027t want to blow up the building just to kill a tenant. That\u0027s probably why you only used that method once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no evidence of any of this,\" she said. \"Old people die all the time. It\u0027s not my fault if the actuarial tables caught up with some of my tenants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were all full of chloral hydrate, Willa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to say something. Her mouth opened, but something stopped the words. She breathed heavily, in and out, and then her hand moved to her mouth and her index finger rubbed at the gum above the two false teeth, replacements for the ones she\u0027d lost in Chicago. She sighed again, heavily, and something went out of her face and the set of her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up her coffee cup, took it over to the sink and emptied it. She got the bottle of Teacher\u0027s from the cabinet and filled the cup. She drank deeply and shuddered. \"God,\" she said, \"you must miss this stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d miss it. Matt, they were just waiting to die, just hanging on and hanging on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you were doing them a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was doing everybody a favor, myself included. There are twenty-four apartments in this building, all with pretty much the same layout. Renovated and sold as co-ops, every apartment in the building would bring a minimum of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. You could probably get a little more for the front ones. They\u0027re a little nicer, they\u0027re airier, the light\u0027s better. Maybe you could up the numbers a little if you did a really nice renovation. Do you know what that comes to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two million dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closer to three. That\u0027s for each building. Buying them cost me every cent I inherited from my parents, and they\u0027re mortgaged to the hilt. The rent roll barely covers payments and taxes and maintenance. I have a few tenants in each building who are paying close to market, and otherwise I couldn\u0027t keep the buildings. Matt, do you think it\u0027s fair that a landlord has to subsidize tenants by letting them hang on to an apartment for a tenth of what it\u0027s worth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. The fair thing is for them to die and for you to make twelve million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be making that much. Once I\u0027ve got a large percentage of vacant apartments I can sell the buildings to somebody who specializes in co-op conversions. If everything comes together the way it should, my profit will be about a million dollars a building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll make four million.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might hang on to one of the buildings. I\u0027m not sure, I haven\u0027t decided. But either way I\u0027ll make a lot of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like a lot to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s actually less than it sounds like. A millionaire used to be a really rich person. Now when the top prize in a lottery is a million dollars it\u0027s considered small-time. But I could live nicely on a couple of million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a shame you won\u0027t be able to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why won\u0027t I?\" She reached out and took my hand, and I felt her energy. \"Matt, there won\u0027t be any more killings. That ended a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tenant in this building died not two months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this building? Matt, that was Carl White, he died of cancer, for God\u0027s sake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was full of chloral, Willa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders sagged. \"He was dying of cancer,\" she said. \"He would have died of his own accord in another month or two. He was in pain all the time.\" She raised her eyes to mine. \"You can believe what you want about me, Matt. You can think I\u0027m the reincarnation of Lucrezia Borgia, but you really can\u0027t turn Carl White\u0027s death into a murder for gain. All I did was lose whatever rent he would have paid in however many months of life he\u0027d have had left to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll try to find a way to twist this, but it was an act of mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Eddie Dunphy? Was that an act of mercy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" she said. \"That was the only one I regret. The others were people who would have killed themselves if they\u0027d had the wit to think of it. No, Eddie wasn\u0027t an act of mercy. Killing him was an act of self-preservation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were afraid he would talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew he would talk. He actually waltzed in here and told me he would talk. He was in AA, the poor damned fool, and he was babbling like some kind of religious convert who had Jesus Christ appear to him on the side of his toaster oven. He said he had to sit down with someone and tell him everything, but that I didn\u0027t have anything to worry about because he would keep my name out of it. \u0027I killed somebody in my building so the landlady could get her apartment, but I won\u0027t tell you who put me up to it.\u0027 He said the person he was going to tell wouldn\u0027t tell anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was right. I wouldn\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d have overlooked multiple homicide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I\u0027d have been breaking the law, but it wouldn\u0027t be the first law I ever broke or the first homicide I overlooked. God never appointed me to go around the world righting wrongs. I\u0027m not a priest, but anything he said to me would have been under the seal of the confessional as far as I was concerned. I told him I\u0027d keep his confidence and I would have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you keep mine?\" She moved closer to me, and her hands fastened first on my wrists, then moved to my forearms. \"Matt,\" she said, \"I invited you in here the first day to find out how much you knew. But I didn\u0027t have to take you to bed to manage that. I went to bed with you because I wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t count on falling in love with you,\" she said, \"but it happened. I feel foolish saying it now because you\u0027ll twist it, but it happens to be the truth. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re in love with me. I think you were starting to be, and I think that\u0027s why you\u0027re angry with me now. But there\u0027s been something real and strong between us from the beginning, and I feel it now, and I know you do, too. Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what I feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you do. And you\u0027re a good influence on me, you\u0027ve already got me making real coffee. Matt, why don\u0027t you give us a chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the easiest thing in the world. All you have to do is forget everything we said tonight. Matt, you just told me you weren\u0027t put on the planet to right all wrongs. You\u0027d have let it go if Eddie had told you about it. Why can\u0027t you do as much for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" She leaned a little closer, and I could smell the scotch on her breath, and remember how her mouth tasted. She said, \"Matt, I\u0027m not going to kill anybody else. That\u0027s over forever, I swear it is. And there\u0027s no real proof I ever killed anyone, is there? A couple of people had a non-lethal dose of a common drug in their systems. Nobody can prove I gave it to them. Nobody can even prove I had it in my possession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I copied the label the other day. I\u0027ve got the number of the prescription, the issuing pharmacy, the date of issue, the physician\u0027s name-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor will tell you I have trouble getting to sleep. I bought the chloral for my own consumption. Matt, there\u0027s no real physical evidence. And I\u0027m a respectable citizen, I\u0027m a property owner, I can afford good lawyers. How good a case could they make against me when all they have is circumstantial evidence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why should we go through all of that?\" She laid a hand on my cheek, stroked along the grain of my beard. \"Matt, darling, we\u0027re both tense, it\u0027s all crazy, it\u0027s a crazy day. Why don\u0027t we go to bed? Right now, the two of us, why don\u0027t we take off our clothes and go to bed and see how we feel afterward. How does that sound to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me how you killed him, Willa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear he never felt a thing, he never knew what was happening. I went up to his room to talk with him. He let me in. I gave him a cup of tea and put the drops in it. Then I came back downstairs, and when I went up again later he was sleeping like a lamb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you said. It was clever of you to figure it out. You\u0027re a good detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you manage it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was already stripped. All he was wearing was the T-shirt. I got the clothesline hooked up, and then I sat him up and fixed the noose around his neck. He never woke up. I just pulled up on the clothesline and let his own body weight shut off his oxygen. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Mrs. Grod?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the way you figured it. I got her to take the chloral and I unlocked her window gates. I didn\u0027t kill her. Eddie did that. He made it look like a struggle, too, and he locked the doors from inside and went back downstairs on the fire escape. Matt, they were all tired of life, the ones I killed. I just gave them a hand in the direction they were already heading.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-33.html","bookId":2325,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM"}
