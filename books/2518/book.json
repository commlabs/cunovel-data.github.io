The drying up of the world\u0027s oil resources leads to the fabled End of Days. Technology stagnates and communities grow ever more insular. With communication between cities lost and attention turned inward, the vampires rise from the shadows where they have survived for centuries and sweep across the globe. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBy the time word spreads it is far too late and Vampires enslave humanity and keep them in walled cities to breed. The Vampires are masters of the darkness but maintain control by day through the use of Thralls - humans who have been bitten but have not yet crossed over, and whose inhuman lusts make daylight as terrifying as night. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn the midst of chaos, a small band of rebels lead a terrified existence, but their survival is threatened by the Vampire\u0027s new scanning procedures.
