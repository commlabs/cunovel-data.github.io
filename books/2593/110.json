I pretend not to acknowledge her presence, though I\u0027m not sure why, since I\u0027m kind of lonely. She moves up to the desk. I\u0027m still staring at the crossword puzzle with my Wayfarers on, stunned but for no real reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe places a file on top of the desk before asking, \"Doin\u0027 the crossword?\" dropping the g in \"doing\" - a pathetic gesture of intimacy, an irritating stab at forced friendliness. I gag inwardly, then nod without looking up at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need help?\" she asks, moving cautiously around the desk to where I sit, and she leans over my shoulder to offer assistance. I\u0027ve already filled in every space with either the word meat or bone and she emits only a slight gasp when noticing this, and when she sees the pile of No. 2 pencils I\u0027ve snapped in half lying on my desk she dutifully picks them up and walks out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jean?\" I call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Patrick?\" She reenters the office trying to downplay her eagerness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to accompany me to dinner?\" I ask, still staring at the crossword, gingerly erasing the m in one of the many meat s I\u0027ve filled the puzzle with. \"That is, if you\u0027re not... doing anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" she answers too quickly and then, I think, realizing this quickness, says, \"I have no plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, isn\u0027t this a coincidence,\" I ask, looking up, lowering my Wayfarers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs lightly but there\u0027s a real urgency in it, something uncomfortable, and this does little in the way of making me feel less sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" she shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also have tickets to a... a Mills Vanilla concert, if you\u0027d like to go,\" I tell her casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, she asks, \"Really? Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milla... Vanilla,\" I repeat slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milla... Vanilla?\" she asks uncomfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milla... Vanilla,\" I say. \"I think that\u0027s what their name is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says, \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... of the name.\" She concentrates, then says, \"I think they\u0027re called... Milli Vanilli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause for a long time before saying, \"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands there, nods once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" I say - I don\u0027t have any tickets to it anyway. \"It\u0027s months from now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she says, nodding again. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, where should we go?\" I lean back and pull my Zagat from the desk\u0027s top drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses, afraid of what to say, taking my question as a test she needs to pass, and then, unsure she\u0027s chosen the right answer, offers, \"Anywhere you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no.\" I smile, leafing through the booklet. \"How about anywhere you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Patrick,\" she sighs. \"I can\u0027t make this decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, come on,\" I urge. \"Anywhere you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh I can\u0027t.\" Helplessly, she sighs again. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I urge her, \"where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks about it for a long time and then, sensing her time is running out, timidly asks, trying to impress me, \"What about... Dorsia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop looking through the Zagat guide and without glancing up, smiling tightly, stomach dropping, I silently ask myself, Do I really want to say no? Do I really want to say I can\u0027t possibly get us in? Is that what I\u0027m really prepared to do? Is that what I really want to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So-o-o-o,\" I say; placing the book down, then nervously opening it up again to find the number. \"Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh I don\u0027t know,\" she says, confused. \"No, we\u0027ll go anywhere you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorsia is... fine,\" I say casually, picking up the phone, and with a trembling finger very quickly dial the seven dreaded numbers, trying to remain cool. Instead of the busy signal I\u0027m expecting, the phone actually rings at Dorsia and after two rings the same harassed voice I\u0027ve grown accustomed to for the past free months answers, shouting out, \"Dorsia, yes?\" the room behind the voice a deafening hum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let\u0027s say, in around twenty minutes?\" I ask, checking my Rolex, offering Jean a wink. She seems impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are totally booked,\" the maitre d\u0027 shouts out smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" I say, trying to look pleased, on the verge of vomiting. \"That\u0027s great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said we are totally booked,\" he shouts. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-110.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
