To control, he corrected, he wanted to control the fate of the artistry, and the career of the artist. Since that afternoon, he’d been able to buy only two pieces of her work. One was as delicate as a daydream, a slim almost weightless column riddled with shimmering rainbows and hardly larger than the span of his hand from wrist to fingertip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second, and the one he could admit privately haunted and enticed him, was a violent nightmare, fired from a passionate mind into a turbulent tangle of glass. It should have been unbalanced, he thought now as he studied the piece on his desk. It should have been ugly with its wild war of colors and shapes, the grasping tendrils curling and clawing out of the squat base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, it was fascinating and uncomfortably sexual. And it made him wonder what kind of woman could create both pieces with equal skill and power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince he had purchased it a little more than two months before, he had tried with no success to contact the artist and interest her in patronage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had twice reached her by phone, but the conversation on her part had been brief to the point of rudeness. She didn’t require a patron, particularly a Dublin businessman with too much education and too little taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, that had stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was, she had told him in her musical west county brogue, content to create at her own pace and sell her work when and where it suited her. She had no need for his contracts, or for someone to tell her what must be sold. It was her work, was it not, so why didn’t he go back to his ledgers, of which she was certain he had plenty, and leave her to it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsolent little twit, he thought, firing up again. Here he was offering a helping hand, a hand that countless other artists would have begged for, and she snarled at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should leave her to it, Rogan mused. Leave her to create in obscurity. It was certain that neither he nor Worldwide needed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, damn it all, he wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn impulse, he picked up his phone and buzzed his secretary. “Eileen, cancel my appointments for the next couple of days. I’m going on a trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rare thing for Rogan to have business in the west counties. He remembered a family holiday from childhood. Most usually his parents had preferred trips to Paris or Milan, or an occasional break in the villa they kept on the French Mediterranean. There had been trips that had combined business and pleasure. New York, London, Bonn, Venice, Boston. But once, when he had been nine or ten, they had driven to the Shannon area to take in the wild, glorious scenery of the west. He remembered it in patches, the dizzying views from the Cliffs of Mohr, the dazzling panoramas and gem-bright waters of the Lake District, the quiet villages and the endless green of farmlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful it was. But it was also inconvenient. He was already regretting his impulsive decision to make the drive, particularly since the directions he’d been given in the nearby village had taken him onto a pitted excuse for a road. His Aston Martin handled it well, even as the dirt turned to mud under the ceaseless driving rain. His mood didn’t negotiate the potholes as smoothly as did his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly stubbornness kept him from turning back. The woman would listen to reason, by God. He would see to it. If she wanted to bury herself behind hedges of furze and hawthorn, it was her business. But her art was his. Or would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the directions he’d been given at the local post office, he passed the bed-and-breakfast called Blackthorn Cottage with its glorious gardens and trim blue shutters. Farther on there were stone cabins, sheds for animals, a hay barn, a slate-roofed shed where a man worked on a tractor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man lifted a hand in salute, then went back to work as Rogan maneuvered the car around the narrow curve. The farmer was the first sign of life, other than livestock, he had seen since leaving the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow anyone survived in this godforsaken place was beyond him. He’d take Dublin’s crowded streets and conveniences over the incessant rain and endless fields every day of the week. Scenery be damned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d hidden herself well, he thought. He’d barely caught sight of the garden gate and the whitewashed cottage beyond it through the tumbling bushes of privet and fuchsia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRogan slowed, though he’d nearly been at a crawl in any case. There was a short drive occupied by a faded blue lorry going to rust. He pulled his dashing white Aston behind it and got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled around to the gate, moved down the short walk that cut between heavy-headed, brilliant flowers that bobbed in the rain. He gave the door, which was painted a bold magenta, three sharp raps, then three again before impatience had him stalking to a window to peer inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a fire burning low in the grate, and a sugan chair pulled up close. A sagging sofa covered in some wild floral print that mated reds and blues and purples teetered in a corner. He would have thought he’d mistaken the house but for the pieces of her work set throughout the small room. Statues and bottles, vases and bowls stood, sat or reclined on every available surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRogan wiped the wet from the window and spied the many-branch candelabra positioned dead center of the mantel. It was fashioned of glass so clear, so pure, it might have been water frozen in place. The arms curved fluidly up, the base a waterfall. He felt the quick surge, the inner click that presaged acquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes, he’d found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow if she’d just answer the damn door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave up on the front and walked through the wet grass around to the back of the cabin. More flowers, growing wild as weeds. Or, he corrected, growing wild with weeds. Miss Concannon obviously didn’t spend much time tidying her beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lean-to beside the door under which bricks of turf were piled. An ancient bike with one flat tire was propped beside them along with a pair of Wellingtons that were muddy to the ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to knock again when the sound coming from behind him had him turning toward the sheds. The roar, constant and low, was almost like the sea. He could see the smoke pluming out of the chimney into the leaden sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building had several windows, and despite the chilly damp of the day, some were propped open. Her workshop, no doubt, Rogan thought, and crossed to it, pleased that he had tracked her down and confident of the outcome of their meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked and, though he received no answer, shoved the door open. He had a moment to register the blast of heat, the sharp smells and the small woman seated in a big wooden chair, a long pipe in her hands. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-in-fire-born-in-trilogy-1/page-9.html","bookId":1560,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:30 PM"}
