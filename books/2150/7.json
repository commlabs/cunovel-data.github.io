{"id":96636,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs I drove away from Penny for Your Thoughts, I noticed my gas gauge was close to empty, so I pulled into a gas station before I reached Brandon\u0027s house, even though I wanted to race to Brandon\u0027s side to tell him what Dr. Meadows had told Nash and not miss even a minute more that I could spend with him - especially since Nash had cut into my time with him. I knew that it would be after dark when I left Brandon\u0027s, but it was still best to fuel up now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby and Ivy would freak if they knew I was getting gas on the Westside. They thought people on the \"wrong\" side of town were shady, to say the least. Everyone was really friendly, and all the people I saw looked normal to me. After I fueled up, I went inside the station to pay. An older man was already being helped, so I stood in line behind him. As soon as it was my turn, I looked up and saw a guy standing in my place, as if I hadn\u0027t been waiting at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy appeared to be a junior or senior and sported black, spiky hair, silver piercings, and several tattoos. He wore a brown waffle shirt and oversized blue jeans. He was attractive but obviously not courteous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was impatient to get to Brandon\u0027s, and I didn\u0027t appreciate that this guy had gotten in my way. So I spoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, it\u0027s my turn,\" I said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spiky-haired guy didn\u0027t budge. He didn\u0027t even acknowledge me but instead told the clerk what he wanted. I was already riled up after Dr. Meadows\u0027s new prediction. I didn\u0027t want to become a werewolf - especially one with Nash - and all that it could mean. And this guy was getting on my already frazzled nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting here,\" I said in the sweetest voice I could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned around. His hazel eyes gazed up my body as he checked me out ever so slowly, from my sandals to the pink headband in my hair. It creeped me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" he responded when he was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" I retorted. \"What about being a gentleman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have time for that,\" he said as he handed the clerk his money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to me, this time standing a little too close for my comfort. I couldn\u0027t physically move him, and I didn\u0027t want to get into an altercation. But I was so surprised - and ticked off - at his rude behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you this rude to everyone?\" I asked in a huff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can be worse.\" He stared into me as if he was daring me to test just how far he could take this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to imagine,\" I shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made him smile. \"So what\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Ryder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed his change and his pack of cigarettes. He didn\u0027t appear old enough to buy them, so I assumed he had a fake ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it\u0027s your turn,\" he said snidely, gesturing to me to step up to the register. He pretended to tip an imaginary hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him one last scowl and broke eye contact with him. He headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two guys around the same age waiting for him outside. One had fiery ginger hair; the other\u0027s was shaggy, long, and blond. For some reason they kept looking back at me. Ryder took out two cigarettes and handed them to his friends. They smoked while he just stared at me. I thought they\u0027d laugh at me, the girl who tried to stand up to the bully, but they didn\u0027t. Instead they just smoked and talked, as if they were discussing something important - me. I paused inside the store, pretending to read a mag, to make sure they weren\u0027t waiting for me to leave. It seemed like an eternity until they threw their butts on the ground and smashed them with their black boots. They got into their car - a vintage black Firebird - and pulled out. I went quickly to my car and started the engine, then saw them idling at the corner. I sped out of the gas station. Once on the road to Brandon\u0027s house, I checked my rearview mirror and was relieved to find they weren\u0027t following me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never seen these guys before in town. And I was hoping that they were just passing through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached Brandon\u0027s guesthouse, he was already waiting outside for me, fixing a broken kitchen chair. \"What took you so long?\" Brandon asked, looking worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to stop for gas. There was this guy at the store who was so rude. He jumped in front of me, and when I said it was my turn, he was like, \u0027Too bad.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is rude.\" He wiped his hands and gave me a long, heavenly kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I was distracted. But when we stopped, my thoughts turned back to my unusual encounter. I shook my head. \"I\u0027ve never seen anyone like him. He was just so brazenly impolite. He should have had manners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he wasn\u0027t taught any. You\u0027ll have to let it go....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. Maybe I should feel sorry for him instead of angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, gently rubbing my back. \"Now tell me what happened at Dr. Meadows\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt even more stressed, like I was going to explode. \"Nash had his reading. He wanted to know what to do. He insisted she tell him. He even grabbed her hand. Then she said a cure would be revealed to him and that he should take it. That he would be cured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With my dad\u0027s serum?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t say. Only that it would be revealed to him. But yes, I think that\u0027s what she meant. I don\u0027t know of any other cures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my dad wants me to take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. So you will, and then we can get some for Nash. He\u0027ll take it and be cured. Then all our werewolf problems will be solved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I fantasized about a life at Legend\u0027s Run High as ordinary as any other student\u0027s. I\u0027d take my classes and see my boyfriend every day. I\u0027d hang with my friends, and Nash could continue to be the star athlete. Our only problems would be what movie to see on the weekend or what dress I\u0027d wear to the next dance. I had to admit, I\u0027d miss those nights under the full moon when Brandon was so wild and irresistible. But I\u0027d forgo those extraordinary times for the chance for him to live a normal life again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great news,\" he said excitedly. Then he changed his tone. \"If you believe in that stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, usually I don\u0027t. But she\u0027s been right before.... But then, it is Dr. Meadows. She wants someone to become a werewolf - so she can get her camera out, tape it, show it to the world, and become famous. And she has more to gain with Nash being a werewolf full-time. Do you think she told him to take it to become a werewolf full-time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that unethical?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It is. But she was trying to use us when I told her about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she was touching him when she gave him that advice. I think she must have really been channeling something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if she gives wrong advice, then she has more to worry about than anyone, don\u0027t you think? She\u0027d be putting herself in harm\u0027s way if she told him to take it, knowing he\u0027d transform every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you\u0027re right,\" I said, sort of relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she predicts he will be cured - then I assume that means...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you will be, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Then I can be. If we believe her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she didn\u0027t say I would be, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I assume so. You are going to take it first, right? Nash can\u0027t be cured until you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon put his arm around me. I sensed the relief he was feeling, and I could only figure he was imagining our lives together without being a werewolf, just as I had a moment ago. However, there were other predictions Dr. Meadows warned of, and I wasn\u0027t too keen on being the one to shake him out of his good mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a luscious kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t make eye contact with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked. \"Isn\u0027t this good news - if it\u0027s true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"But there\u0027s also the other thing she said.\" I chewed my lip as I decided how to tell him about the last prediction she had made. \"Nash is going to bite me,\" I finally blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to do what?\" he asked, half laughing. \"I thought you went there to find out if he\u0027s going to be cured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a joke. I think Nash is going to bite me and turn me into a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you think that? Did Dr. Meadows say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow down.\" He put his arm around me and guided me to a picnic bench in his grandparents\u0027 backyard. We sat on the tabletop. \"Now, tell me everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I left, she said, \u0027Beware of the full moon. A werewolf wants to take you into his world. Forever.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can mean a lot of things,\" Brandon surmised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means one thing. Nash is going to turn me into a werewolf. I\u0027m the next one in line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon thought for a moment. \"What - how is he going to take you into his world?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could bite me. You\u0027ve seen him when he changes. He\u0027s violent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now he\u0027s aware of himself when he\u0027s a werewolf. We were hoping your kiss would cure him of the thoughtless violence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But that was before Dr. Meadows made this horrible prediction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if she\u0027s not talking about that werewolf? What if she means me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked. I hadn\u0027t even thought of Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she is warning you that I\u0027m going to hurt you - bite you. Maybe the warning was about me.\" Brandon was visibly disturbed. He stood and paced around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you hurt me?\" I asked. \"You haven\u0027t before. I\u0027ve been with you a bunch of times when you were in lycan form. But Nash - he\u0027s tried to attack me at least two times. The next full moon is coming soon, Brandon. What if he finds me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" he reassured me. He came back and sat beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was really scared. My life seemed to be spinning in chaos. The thought of my becoming a werewolf? My hands began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so shaken up by the visit, the prediction, and the rude boy, I began to cry. I wanted our love life to be easier. Do homework together, kiss and cuddle, take walks in the woods. Now it was spiraling out of control. I felt like I was in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon held me tightly as I wiped away tears that streamed down my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was scared when you first turned,\" I said. \"Then again when Nash did. Now I\u0027m scared again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t have gone to Dr. Meadows. She puts horrible thoughts in your head. And who says she\u0027s right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been right all along,\" I argued. \"I knew I shouldn\u0027t have gone with Nash. But I felt sad for him. And now look what has happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does she know, really?\" Brandon proposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...everything! She\u0027s been right about everything. And if I\u0027d listened to her from the beginning, I wouldn\u0027t have walked home alone....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, I know...I wouldn\u0027t have been bitten,\" Brandon said as if finishing my sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" I said. \"She said it first and then it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon paused. I knew he didn\u0027t believe in Dr. Meadows\u0027s predictions, but my nervousness was making him rethink the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we have to do something about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to let Nash take the serum,\" Brandon said firmly to me, \"on the night of the next full moon. He\u0027ll come here, and I\u0027ll give it to him. We have to - if not for his sake, then for yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked. \"You decided...you were going to take it. Finally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we didn\u0027t know about this. And now I can\u0027t take that chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized what he was really giving up: the cure for himself. \"But that means you\u0027ll still be a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if it means you won\u0027t, then I\u0027m game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But your father - you promised you\u0027d be the one who takes it first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was before I knew about this prediction. If you say she\u0027s been right before, then we can\u0027t chance it this time. He can\u0027t change you into a werewolf if he isn\u0027t one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your father was counting on me to make sure you took it. I don\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t want to let him down,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to worry about that. You have enough on your plate besides worrying about my father\u0027s feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Nash will take the dose you have and then you\u0027ll get your father to make you another dose for the following full moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted us to be together,\" I said. \"I wanted you to be normal - for your own sake. And now you won\u0027t be.... It seems to get more chaotic every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon appeared content. I think he was relieved to be helping out Nash and me at the same time when, in fact, I wanted to be the one who was helping Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day after school, I saw Nash and tried to catch him before he went to practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure you should be near me anymore,\" he said. \"What Dr. Meadows said at the end...You can\u0027t be around me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have to be,\" I insisted. \"I have something to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get too close,\" he said. \"The moon will be full soon. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t do anything now but listen,\" I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\" I pulled him aside on the steps to the side entrance of school. \"We might have a cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon\u0027s father is a scientist. He made a possible antidote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? This is great!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon\u0027s father made it for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...yes, that makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His father was just in town. And Brandon told him about you. He asked for a second batch for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon did that for me?\" Nash was taken aback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Yes. There is only one vial now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" he said. \"But that still is great news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\" I asked. I wasn\u0027t sure how Nash would respond - if he\u0027d be hopeful or competitive that Brandon might be cured first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One less werewolf,\" he said with a smile. \"And then if it works for him...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can work for you,\" I assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate you telling me this.\" He leaned in and gave me a friendly hug. He was so relieved I could feel his tension releasing in our embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something else to tell you,\" I said when he pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon wants you to take it first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Why? Because of Dr. Meadows\u0027s prediction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reluctantly nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does he think I\u0027ll be the one to bite you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both think so. I\u0027ve been around Brandon for several full moons. He hasn\u0027t hurt me at all. He\u0027s only been kinder, even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ve been a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember, Celeste. I remember everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both quiet for a minute, neither one of us wanting to talk about the horrible ways he\u0027d acted before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash finally smiled and broke the silence. \"Of course I\u0027ll take it. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s going to give it to me.\" He paused, really taking in Brandon\u0027s generosity. \"I owe him big-time! Maybe I can get him a spot on the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt relieved that Nash was going to take the serum and that he was grateful to Brandon. Nash was not only changing as a werewolf but as a human being, too - he was becoming much more gracious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that day, Brandon and I were settling into his guesthouse room. He was placing his backpack on his computer table and I was laying my sweater over his chair when we heard Apollo barking and a car pull up the long drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grandparents must be home,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon rose and peeked out the window. \"That\u0027s not my grandparents,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back the curtain even farther. It was a BMW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was Nash doing at Brandon\u0027s? He never came to this side of town if he didn\u0027t have to. But I had an inkling as to why he was making such a sudden appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon opened the door and stepped out as I hopped off the chair. It was as if he thought I might be threatened and was heading Nash off at the pass. I tried to follow behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash got out of his car and walked toward my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApollo continued to bark. Nash had always been afraid of dogs - and at the very least shied away from them. So when Apollo raced for Nash, I was sure he\u0027d step back a few feet. However, Nash didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon called out to Apollo, but he didn\u0027t retreat. Instead Nash just watched Apollo as the husky proceeded straight for him. When the dog reached Nash, Nash looked down at him with an intense stare. Apollo winced and raced back to Brandon, cowering behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash continued to walk toward Brandon. \"Hey, dude,\" Nash said in a friendly voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey - \" Brandon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste told me...about the cure,\" Nash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your voice down!\" Brandon chided. No one was around, but I could feel my boyfriend\u0027s tension about even the birds knowing his lycan identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Celeste says you are giving it to me,\" he said, lowering his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was obviously touched. \"I can\u0027t believe that you\u0027d do that for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something, but it\u0027s only a possible cure,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A possible one is better than none at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if it works,\" Brandon confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still can\u0027t believe you are going to give it to me,\" Nash said. \"What\u0027s the worst that can happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s no guarantee it will work, honestly. You might end up a werewolf full-time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste didn\u0027t tell me that part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt awkward. \"I wanted to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a chance we have to take,\" Nash insisted. \"If it works for me, then it will work for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was showing a milder, more generous side. It was as if becoming a werewolf had made him more understanding as a human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here next Friday, just before the first night of the full moon,\" Brandon said. \"I will have it for you to take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash shook Brandon\u0027s hand, got back into his car, and drove off. I leaned into Brandon and gave him a huge hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon and I took a walk in his backyard. But even when we stopped to admire the several deer we spotted in the woods or when we shared a few passionate kisses, the cure and its possible side effects were never too far from our thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were nestled together by a tree as the sun was setting. Brilliant shades of reds and orange hovered over the treetops in a spectacular display. It was breathtaking as we kissed and cuddled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we drew apart, Brandon brushed the hair away from my face. He gazed lovingly at my eyes, my cheeks, my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still hard for me to get your kiss with Nash out of my head,\" Brandon said suddenly. \"At times, I\u0027m glad he\u0027s a werewolf! Serves him right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. It\u0027s only natural to have those feelings. If I saw you kiss Hayley,\" I said, referring to the skater chick on the Westside who was fond of Brandon, \"I\u0027d lose it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really did such a nice thing for Nash,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe this whole thing will be over very soon. If Nash is cured, I can be next in line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then the Legend\u0027s Run werewolves will be extinct,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned against him and rubbed his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took me into his embrace and nuzzled against me. \"You\u0027ll still bring out the animal in me,\" he laughed. \"I don\u0027t think that will change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled as he tickled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think our world will be like when I\u0027m cured?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it would be like this,\" I said. \"Us hanging out and doing everyday stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be satisfied with that?\" he asked seriously. \"Me just being a regular guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never be regular,\" I assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually I bet you can\u0027t wait. Dating a werewolf - a freak - I\u0027m so lucky you\u0027ve stood by me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" I said. \"But it hasn\u0027t been all bad. There are some things I like about being with a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" he asked, like my feelings were unimaginable. \"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like when you save little boys from a pack of wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You liked that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded enthusiastically. \"And you\u0027re really strong. Your muscles are killer, and you run so fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, if I take the serum, you think I\u0027ll just be a weak troll?\" he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for a moment, I assumed reflecting on his time as a lycan. \"I won\u0027t be able to see in the night. Or sleep outside among the stars without protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no more wolves following us around like pets,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed up at the waxing moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I love that wolf pack. They are really so gentle and protective,\" he lamented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like being a werewolf, don\u0027t you?\" I hinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" Brandon sat up as if I\u0027d spoken out of turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s okay,\" I tried to assure him. \"You can tell me. You like the outdoors. And this does provide you with an insight into the animal world that most people don\u0027t get to experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused and then relaxed a bit. \"Yes, I guess,\" he said, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I was the one wanting to continue his life as a werewolf. Did I like him so much in that form that I was missing how it was making him feel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make me sound like I enjoy being a monster,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t a monster,\" I assured him, and gave him a hug. \"You\u0027re something extraordinary. With and without a full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hopefully we\u0027ll eventually put an end to my life as a werewolf.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-7.html","bookId":2150,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM"}
