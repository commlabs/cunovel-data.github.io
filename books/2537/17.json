Maybe it was a battlefield well known to historians and celebrated in all the books, a place where two armies had once clashed in a bloody, murderous conflict¡ªand the juggernaut of the blitzkrieg had shuddered to a halt and been rolled back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it was one of our obscure, unknown fields of infamy, where the crack German units had trampled into the mud the untrained and poorly armed volunteers thrown against them? A place only remembered in the archives of the Ministry of Defense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know my history very well, but it was probably the latter. This place was too deserted, too bleak and dead. An abandoned patch of dirt that not even the collective farms had coveted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our country they don\u0027t like to erect monuments on battlefields where we were defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that\u0027s because our victories weren\u0027t all that slick either?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood on the bank of the little river and looked at the expanse of dead ground. It wasn\u0027t all that big: a strip of land between the forest and the river, about a half mile long, 6 miles wide. And not so very many people had been killed here. More likely hundreds than thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, how could you really say that wasn\u0027t many?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe field was absolutely deserted. I couldn\u0027t see anybody with my normal vision, and a glance through the Twilight hadn\u0027t revealed anything either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I picked up my shadow¡ªthe setting sun was shining from behind me¡ªand entered the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first level the ground was overgrown with blue moss, but not very thickly. The usual scraggy clumps, clutching greedily at the faint echoes of human emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was one thing that put me on my guard. The moss seemed to run in rings around one particular spot. I knew the moss could move, creeping along slowly but stubbornly moving toward its food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in this place there was only one possible reason for it to form into circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set off through the thick gray haze. The human world was visible through it all around me, like a faded, poorly exposed black and white photograph. It was cold and cheerless¡ªI was losing energy with every second I spent here. But there was a positive side to that. Not even Arina could stay in the Twilight constantly. She could glance into the first level from the ordinary world, but even that required Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now she was in no position to be reckless and wasteful with what she had stored up over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first level the terrain is almost unchanged. Here too I had earth under my feet, ruts and humps. But I discovered something else. I could see, or rather, sense the old weapons in the ground. Not every one, of course, only those that had actually killed. Half-decayed submachine guns, slightly better preserved rifles... There were more rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a hundred yards from Arina I hunkered down and started running in a squat. The spell Svetlana had put on me was still working, or I would soon have been out of breath. About fifty meters away, I lay down and started to crawl. The ground was damp, and I was instantly coated with mud. At least I knew that when I left the Twilight the mud would simply drop off. The blue moss began stirring, uncertain what to do¡ªmove closer to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme or crawl away from any possible danger. That was bad. Arina might realize what was agitating the moss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, very close to me, only about five meters away, a head with long black hair began rising slowly into the air from the densely overgrown ground. The trench was so narrow, it looked as if Arina was emerging straight from the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arina wasn\u0027t looking in my direction. She rose up very slowly until she was standing erect¡ªshe seemed to be sitting on the bottom of the old trench. Then she raised her hand theatrically to shade her eyes, as if she were saluting. I realized she was looking through the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, not at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy recruits were getting close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow beautifully they ran! Even from the Twilight their movement looked fast¡ªthey just hung in the air too long when they leapt. The wise old wolf was leading the way, with the cubs behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA human being would have been frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina laughed. She put her hands on her hips, I swear like a young peasant woman from Ukraine watching her good-for-nothing husband approach with his drinking companions. She spoke, and low, rumbling sounds began drifting through the air. She was in no hurry to enter the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved back into the human world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... stupid loudmouths!\" I heard. \"Wasn\u0027t what you got last time enough for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves slowed to a walk and stopped about twenty yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader stepped forward and barked, \"Witch!... Talk... We have to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk away, gray wolf,\" Arina said amiably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgor couldn\u0027t distract the witch for long, I realized that. Any moment now she would plunge into the Twilight and take a proper look around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where was Nadiushka?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give us... the little girl...\" the wolf half-shouted, half-howled. \"The Light One... is on the rampage... give us the girl... or it will... be worse for you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think you can threaten me?\" Arina asked in surprise. \"Have you completely lost your wits. Who would give a child to wolves? Clear out while you still can!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange¡ªshe seemed to be dragging things out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the child... alive?\" the wolf asked in a slightly clearer voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadenka, are you alive?\" Arina asked, looking down somewhere at the ground. She stooped down, lifted my little girl out of the trench and set her on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught my breath. Nadenka didn\u0027t look frightened or tired at all. She seemed to be enjoying what was happening¡ªa lot more than her walks with her grandma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was close to the witch, too close!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolfie!\" said Nadya, looking at the werewolf. She reached her little hand out to him and laughed happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf started wagging his tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only lasted a few seconds, then Igor tensed up, his fur bristled, and once again we were watching a wild beast, not a tame dog. But even so, that moment had happened¡ªa werewolf had fawned on a little two-year-old girl, an uninitiated Other!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolfie,\" Arina agreed. \"Nadenka, look to see who else is here. Close your eyes and look. The way I taught you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadiushka happily put her hands over her eyes. And began turning in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch was initiating her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Nadiushka really had learned to look through the Twilight...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy daughter turned toward me. She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next moment I realized two things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst¡ªArina knew perfectly well that I was nearby! The witch had been toying with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond¡ªNadiushka wasn\u0027t looking through the Twilight! She had parted her fingers and looked through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately withdrew into the Twilight. I was in such a nervous state that I plunged straight through to the second level¡ªinto that desolate cotton-wool silence and those pale-gray shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina\u0027s aura was blazing orange and turquoise. Nadiushka\u0027s head was surrounded by a glowing, pure white halo¡ªlike a beacon beaming light into space: a potential Other! A Light One! With immense Power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the werewolves, who had started to run now, were bundles of red and crimson, fury and spite, hunger and fear...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Svetlana,\" I shouted, leaping up. Into the gray space, into the soft silence. \"Come!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI marked the spot for the portal very simply¡ªby flinging pure Power into the Twilight, like stretching out a string of fire, a landing corridor. From me to Arina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the same time I started to run, so that Nadiushka wouldn\u0027t shield Arina from me, scattering from my fingers spells that I had learned a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreeze¡ªa localized halt in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpium¡ªsleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriple Blade¡ªthe crudest and simplest of all the combat spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanatos¡ªdeath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no hope any of them would work. These things could only be effective when you were facing a very weak opponent. An Other with superior powers would parry the blows, whether he was in the Twilight or the human world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I wanted to do was distract the witch and slow her down. Overload her defenses, which had to be based on amulets and talismans. All these fireworks were only calculated to identify a breach in those defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Freeze seemed to disappear into nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sleep spell ricocheted off and shot up into the sky. I hoped there weren\u0027t any airplanes overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Triple Blade struck home and the glittering blades sliced into the witch. But to her the Triple Blade was a mere scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst of all was the summons to death. I had good reason to be fond of this piece of magic, so dangerously close to the spells of the Dark Ones. But even in the ordinary world, Arina still had time to hold out her hand, and the little bundle of gray mist that paralyzed the will and stopped the heart landed obediently on her open palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina looked at me through the Twilight, smiling. Her hand was hovering over Nadiushka\u0027s head, and the gray bundle was slowly oozing between her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leapt toward them¡ªif I couldn\u0027t turn the blow aside, at least I could take it myself...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arina was already on the second level of the Twilight now, moving fast. She looked blindingly beautiful. A movement of her fingers crumpled my spell, and she casually tossed it at the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be in such a hurry...\" the witch chanted in a singsong voice. In the silence of the second level her words were like thunder, and my legs betrayed me. I slumped down onto my knees only one step away from Arina and Nadiushka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch her!\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I ask you...\" the witch said in a quiet voice. \"Why not just help me get away... what\u0027s one old witch more or less to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina nodded wearily and bitterly. \"You\u0027re right not to trust me... And now what am I to do, sorcerer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand slid across her skirt and tore a sprig of dried berries off her belt. She tossed them into the blazing white lights, black smoke billowed up¡ªand the marker for the portal disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana was too late!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave me no choice, Light One...\" Arina said with a grim expression. \"Do you understand? I\u0027ll have to kill you, and then your daughter\u0027s no use to me anymore. What were you thinking of, with your second-level?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that instant a glittering white sword-blade struck Arina from behind, protruded for an instant from her chest, then drew back in obedience to some invisible hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A-a-a-agh...\" the witch groaned, slumping forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the gray gloom parted to let Svetlana through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch seemed to have recovered from the blow already. She retreated, jigging backward and keeping her eyes fixed on Svetlana. The slit that had been burned through her dress was smoking, but she wasn\u0027t bleeding. And the look on her face seemed more like admiration than hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My, my... Great One...\" Arina cackled. \"Did I miscalculate then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana didn\u0027t answer. I could never have imagined such intense hatred in her face¡ªany man would have died if he just looked in her eyes. She was clutching a white sword in her right hand, and the fingers of her left were working the air¡ªas if she were assembling an invisible Rubik\u0027s cube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Twilight turned a little darker. A rainbow sphere sprang up around Nadiushka. Svetlana\u0027s next pass was for me¡ªmy body recovered the power of movement. I jumped up and started moving behind the witch. I was only a bit player in this war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which level did you come from, you fidget?\" the witch asked almost amiably. \"Could it really be the fourth? I was keeping an eye on the third...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed that the answer was very, very important to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the fifth,\" Svetlana replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s really bad...\" the witch muttered. \"That\u0027s a mother\u0027s fury for you...\" she squinted at me out of the corner of her eye, then fixed her gaze on Svetlana again. \"Don\u0027t you go gossiping about what you saw down there...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to tell me,\" Svetlana said with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch nodded and then began working her hands very rapidly, tearing out her hair. I didn\u0027t know if Svetlana was expecting this, but I decided it would be a good idea to jump back. It was a good thing I did¡ªa black blizzard sprang up and began swirling around the witch, as if every hair had been transformed into a slim, sharp blade of black steel. Arina began advancing on Svetlana, who tossed her white sword at the witch¡ªthe blades sliced it to pieces and extinguished it, but then a transparent shield appeared, floating in the air in front of Svetlana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it must be Luzhin\u0027s Shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blades shattered against the shield almost instantly, without a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lordy...\" Arina wailed. It was strange, but I didn\u0027t have the slightest doubt that she was sincere. And yet at the same time she was playing to her audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words¡ªto me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surrender, you wretch,\" said Svetlana. \"While I\u0027ll still let you¡ªsurrender!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how about... how about this?\" Arina declared. \"Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time she didn\u0027t reach for her amulets. She just started crooning her clumsy doggerel:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust to dust collect and bind, Arms and legs with power filling, Be my trusty servants willing. Or you\u0027ll be scattered to the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been expecting anything at all from Arina. Except this. Genuine necromancers are very rare, even among the Dark Ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead were slowly rising out of the earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe German soldiers of the Second World War were going back into battle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour skeletons dressed in tatters¡ªall their flesh had gone a long time ago and there was earth packed between their bones¡ª stood in a ring around Arina. Another came staggering blindly toward me, clumsily waving its fingerless hands¡ªthe bones had rotted clean away. The ludicrous zombie shed pieces of itself at every step. Three equally wretched monsters started toward Svetlana. One of them was even holding a black submachine gun that had lost its magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think you can raise the Red Army?\" Arina taunted Svetlana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shouldn\u0027t have done that¡ªSvetlana seemed to turn to stone. And then she hissed through her teeth:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandfather fought in the war. Was this supposed to frighten me?...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t understand what it was she did. I would have used the Gray Prayer, but she used something from the higher levels of magic beyond my reach. The zombies crumbled into dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana and Arina were left staring at each other in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe joking was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enchantress and the witch clashed in a straightforward dual of Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took advantage of the brief pause to gather my own strength. If Svetlana faltered, then I would strike...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Arina who faltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, her dress was torn off. That might possibly have had a demoralizing effect¡ªon a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the witch began aging rapidly. Her luxuriant black hair shrank to a pitiful gray tuft. Her breasts drooped and stretched, her arms and legs withered. She was like Gingema from the children\u0027s story or Gagula from the story for adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were no special effects here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your name!\" Svetlana shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina didn\u0027t hesitate for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer toothless mouth quivered and she mumbled, \"Arina... I am in your power, sorceress...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only then that Svetlana relaxed¡ªand suddenly seemed to wilt. I walked around the subdued Arina and took hold of my wife\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right... I\u0027m okay,\" Svetlana said with a smile. \"We did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old crone¡ªit was impossible to think of her as Arina¡ª gazed at us sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you allow her to assume her former shape?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, was she more attractive then?\" said Svetlana, attempting to joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll die of old age in a moment,\" I said. \"She\u0027s over two hundred years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her croak...\" Svetlana muttered. She glowered at Arina. \"Witch! I grant you the right to become younger!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina\u0027s body rapidly straightened up and filled with life. The witch gulped at the air greedily. She looked at me. \"Thank you, sorcerer...\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Svetlana ordered. \"And no stupid tricks... I grant you only the right to leave the Twilight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow all the witch\u0027s power¡ªall that had not been stripped away with her clothes and amulets¡ªwas completely under Svetlana\u0027s control. To coin a phrase, Svetlana had her hand on the switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorcerer...\" said Arina, keeping her eyes fixed on me. \"First remove the shield from your daughter. There is a grenade with the pin drawn lying under her feet. It will explode at any moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dashed to the rainbow globe and struck it, breaking through the Sphere of Negation. Beneath it there were another two shields. I tore them away crudely, working with raw energy. From the second level of the Twilight I couldn\u0027t see anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found my shadow and shot back up to the first level. Everything was clear there, not a trace of the blue moss¡ªthe raging battle had burned it away completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd almost immediately I saw the old \"pineapple\" lying under Nadiushka\u0027s foot. Arina had left it there as she plunged into the Twilight. Her insurance policy...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pin was pulled out. Somewhere inside the grenade the fuse was burning away with agonizing slowness, and in the human world three or four seconds had already gone by...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe casualty range was 200 yards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it had exploded inside the shields, there would have been nothing left of Nadiushka but a bloody pulp...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned down and picked up the grenade. It\u0027s very difficult to work with objects of the real world when you are in the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the grenade had a distinct Twilight double¡ªthe same ribs and ridges, smeared with mud and rust...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I throw it away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Twilight it wouldn\u0027t go far. And if I took it into the human world¡ªit would explode instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t think of anything better to do than slice the grenade in half¡ªas if I were trying to remove the stone from an avocado pear. Then I sliced it again into several pieces... searching for the small, glowing string of the slow fuse among the metal and explosive. My phantom knife, a blade of pure Power, chopped through the grenade like a ripe tomato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I found it¡ªa tiny little spark already creeping close to the detonator. I extinguished it with my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I tumbled out into the human world. Soaked and sweaty, barely able to stand, my legs were trembling so badly, shaking my hand¡ªmy burnt fingers were stinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give a man a chance to tinker with anything mechanical,\" Arina said scathingly when she appeared after me. I ought to have shut her inside the shield and let her be blown to pieces! Or I could have cast a frost on her and left her frozen solid until the next day...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy, teach me how to hide like that,\" said Nadiushka, none the worse for her adventure. Then she spotted Arina and said indignantly, \"Aunty, don\u0027t be silly! You can\u0027t walk around with no clothes on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many times have I told you not to talk to grown-ups like that!\" Svetlana exclaimed. Then she grabbed hold of Nadiushka\u0027s hands and started kissing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scene from a madhouse...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf my mother-in-law had been there, she\u0027d have had a few things to say...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down on the edge of the trench, longing for a smoke. And I wanted a drink. And something to eat. And a sleep. At least a smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t do it again,\" Nadya babbled. \"Look, wolfie\u0027s hurt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only then that I remembered about the werewolves and looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf was lying on the ground with his paws twitching feebly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, sorcerer,\" said Arina. \"I threw your death spell at the wolf. There was no time to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Svetlana. Thanatos doesn\u0027t necessarily mean certain death. The spell can be removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m drained...\" Svetlana said in a low voice. \"I\u0027ve no strength left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll save the filthy creature if you like,\" Arina suggested. \"It\u0027s not hard for me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you tell us about the grenade?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good will it do me if she dies?\" Arina replied indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be a Great Light One,\" said Svetlana. \"The Greatest of all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let her.\" Arina smiled. \"Maybe she\u0027ll remember her Aunty Arina, who told her about the herbs and the flowers... Don\u0027t you worry. No one will ever make her into a Dark One. She\u0027s no simple child, there was magic involved there... What shall I do with the wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save him,\" Svetlana said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina nodded. Then suddenly she said to me, \"There\u0027s a bag over there in the trench... with cigarettes and food. I prepared this hideaway a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch worked on Igor for about ten minutes. First she drove away the growling cubs, who ran off to one side and tried to change back into children, but couldn\u0027t, so they lay down in the bushes. Then she started whispering something, all the while plucking first one plant, then another. She shouted at the cubs and they ran off and came back with twigs and roots in their teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana and I looked at each other without speaking. Everything was perfectly clear anyway. I finished my second cigarette, rolled a third between my hands to soften it, and took a block of chocolate out of the black fabric bag. Apart from cigarettes, chocolate, and a wad of English pounds¡ªwhat a prudent witch!¡ª the bag was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow I\u0027d been hoping to find the Fuaran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witch,\" Svetlana shouted when the werewolf got to his feet, still trembling. \"Come here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina came back to us, swinging her hips daintily, and not even slightly embarrassed at being naked. The werewolf lay down close to us too. He was breathing heavily, and the cubs crowded around and started licking him. Svetlana winced at the sight, then turned to look at Arina. \"What are you accused of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the instructions of an unidentified Light One I modified the recipe for a potion and so ruined a joint experiment by the Inquisition, the Night Watch, and the Day Watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Arina admitted blithely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever since the Revolution I\u0027d been dreaming of doing real damage to the Reds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lie,\" said Svetlana, frowning. \"You couldn\u0027t give a damn for the Reds or the Whites. Why did you take the risk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does that make, sorceress?\" Arina sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A big one. And in the first place, for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch threw her head back and looked up at me, then at Svetlana. Her eyelids were trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aunty Arina, are you feeling sad?\" Nadiushka asked. Then she glanced sideways at her mother and put her hands over her own mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the witch replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment I really, really didn\u0027t want Arina to fall into the clutches of the Inquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The experiment was supported by all the Others,\" Arina said. \"The Dark Ones believed that the appearance of thousands of convinced communists in the leadership of the country¡ªthe bread plant\u0027s output mostly went to the Kremlin and the People\u0027s Commissariats¡ªwouldn\u0027t improve anything. On the contrary, it would only provoke hostility to the Soviets in the rest of the world. But the Light Ones believed that after a hard, but victorious war against Germany¡ªthe likelihood of that was already clear to the clairvoyants by then¡ªthe Soviet Union could become a genuinely attractive society. There was a secret report... basically, people would have built communism by 1980...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And made corn the basic animal-feed crop,\" Svetlana snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk drivel, sorceress,\" the witch retorted calmly. \"I don\u0027t remember about any corn, but they were supposed to have built a city on the moon in the \u002770s. And fly to Mars, and something else. The whole of Europe would have been communist. And not under constraint either. And by now here on earth we\u0027d have had a huge Soviet Union, a huge United States... I think Britain, Canada, and Australia were part of it... And there was China left on its own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the Light Ones miscalculated?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Arina shook her head. \"They didn\u0027t miscalculate. Of course, the blood would have flowed in rivers. But what came at the end of it all wouldn\u0027t have been too bad. Far better than all the regimes we have now... The Light Ones overlooked something else. If things had gone that way, then around about now people would have learned that the Others existed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" said Svetlana. Nadiushka was squirming restlessly on her knees¡ªshe was bored of sitting and she wanted to go to the \"wolfie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s why the... unidentified Light One...\"¡ªArina smiled¡ª\"who had the wits to calculate the future more thoroughly than all the rest, came to me. We met a few times and discussed the situation. The problem was that the experiment had not just been planned by Higher Others, who could appreciate the danger of our being exposed, but also by a large number of first- and second-level magicians... even some third- and fourth-level ones. The project was extremely popular; in order to cancel it officially, full information would have had to be given to thousands of Others. There was no way that could be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" said Svetlana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t understand a thing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe conceal our existence from people because we\u0027re afraid. There are too few of us, and no magic is strong enough to guarantee our survival if a new campaign of \"witch hunts\" starts up. But in this wonderful, benign future that Arina said could already have happened, would we really have been in any danger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why we decided to sabotage the experiment,\" Arina continued. \"It increased the numbers killed in the Second World War, but reduced the numbers who died in the export of revolution to Europe and Northern Africa. It came out more or less even... of course, now life in Russia\u0027s not as sweet and easy as it ought to have been. But who ever said that happiness is measured by a full belly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sure!\" I exclaimed, unable to restrain myself. \"Any teacher in a town on the Volga or miner in Ukraine will agree with you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happiness should be sought in spiritual wealth,\" Arina rebuked me. \"And not in baths filled with bubbles or a warm privy. And at least people don\u0027t know about the Others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my tongue. The woman sitting in front of us was not simply guilty¡ªshe ought to have been dragged to the tribunal on a rope and stoned along the way. A city on the moon? Okay, if we didn\u0027t have a city on the moon, we could do without it. But even our ordinary cities were barely alive, and the entire world was still wary of us...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor thing,\" said Svetlana. \"Did you suffer a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought she was mocking Arina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch thought the same. \"Are you sympathizing or scoffing?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sympathizing,\" Svetlana answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel sorry for the little people¡ªdon\u0027t get the wrong idea,\" the witch hissed. \"But I do feel sorry for the country. It\u0027s my country, whatever it\u0027s like, all of it. But the way things turned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout is best. We\u0027ll carry on living, we won\u0027t die out. People will give birth to new people, they\u0027ll build cities and plough the fields.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t the secret police you were hiding from in your hibernation,\" Svetlana said unexpectedly. \"And not even the Inquisition. You would have talked your way out of it somehow, I can sense it... You didn\u0027t want to see what was happening to Russia after your sabotage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina said nothing to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Svetlana looked at me. \"What are we going to do now?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You decide,\" I said, not really understanding the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you going to run to?\" Svetlana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Siberia,\" Arina replied calmly. \"That\u0027s the way things are done in Russia¡ªthey either exile you to Siberia, or you flee there yourself. I\u0027ll choose a nice clean little village and settle somewhere outside it. I\u0027ll earn my own living... find myself a man.\" She ran one hand over her magnificent breasts with a smile. \"And wait for about twenty years, to see what happens. And at the same time I\u0027ll think about what to tell the Inquisition if they catch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t get past the cordons on your own,\" Svetlana muttered. \"And I doubt if we can get you through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll... hide her...\" the werewolf coughed hoarsely. \"I... owe... her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina narrowed her eyes and asked \"For what, for healing you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... not for that...\" the werewolf replied vaguely. \"I\u0027ll lead you... through the forest... to the camp... hide you there... later you\u0027ll... get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s going to...\" I began. But Svetlana gently put her hand against my lips, as if she were comforting Nadiushka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anton, it\u0027s the best way. It\u0027s best if Arina gets away. After all, she didn\u0027t touch Nadienka, did she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started shaking my head. This was rubbish, crazy nonsense! Had the witch somehow managed to control Svetlana\u0027s mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the best way,\" Svetlana repeated insistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned to Arina. \"Witch! Swear me an oath that you will never again take the life of a human or an Other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot swear such an oath,\" said Arina, with a shake of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swear me an oath that for the next hundred years you will not take the life of a human or an Other unless they threaten your own life... and you have no other means to defend yourself,\" Svetlana concluded after a short pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, that\u0027s a different matter!\" Arina said and smiled. \"Now I can see that our Great One has matured a bit... It\u0027s not much fun to spend a century without any teeth. But even so, I obey. May the Darkness bear me witness!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her open hand, and a small patch of Darkness appeared for a moment on her palm. All the werewolves, the adult and the cubs, began to howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I return your power to you,\" Svetlana said before I could stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Arina disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped to my feet and stood beside Svetlana. I still had a little bit of Power left... enough to strike a couple of times, but what did the witch care about blows like that...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina suddenly reappeared in front of us. Already dressed, I think she had even brushed her hair. Smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could still fix you without any killing,\" she gloated. \"I could paralyze you or make you ugly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could,\" Svetlana agreed. \"No doubt. Only what would be the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a brief moment Arina\u0027s eyes were filled with such intense melancholy that I felt my heart ache in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t any point, sorceress. Well then, goodbye. I don\u0027t remember kindnesses, but I\u0027m not ashamed to say thank you... so thank you, Great One. It will be hard for you... now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know that,\" Svetlana said in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina\u0027s gaze came to rest on me and she smiled flirtatiously. \"And goodbye to you, sorcerer. Don\u0027t feel sorry for me, I don\u0027t like that. Ah... what a pity you love your wife...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knelt down and held her hand out to Nadiushka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana didn\u0027t stop her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, little girl,\" the witch said merrily. \"I\u0027m a wicked old aunty, but I wish you well. Whoever it was that sketched out your destiny was no fool... oh, no fool at all... maybe you\u0027ll succeed where we failed? Now I have a little present for you...\" She glanced at Svetlana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana nodded, to my great surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArina took hold of Nadiushka\u0027s finger. She muttered, \"Shall I wish you Power? You have plenty of Power already. They\u0027ve given you everything... and plenty of everything... You like flowers, don\u0027t you? Then take this gift from me¡ªhow to use flowers and herbs. That will come in handy even for a Light Enchantress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, Aunty Arina,\" Nadiushka said in a quiet voice. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch looked at me again. I was dumbfounded, totally confused, I didn\u0027t understand a thing. Then she turned to the werewolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, lead on, gray wolf!\" she exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf cubs went dashing after the witch and their mentor. One filthy little beast even stopped beside a bush, lifted his leg and sprayed it defiantly. Nadiushka giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Svetlana,\" I whispered. \"They\u0027re getting away...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let them go,\" she replied. \"Let them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happened?\" I asked, looking into her eyes. \"What and when?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go home,\" said Svetlana. \"We... we need to have a talk, Anton.
