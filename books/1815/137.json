If there’s anything I can do, please let me know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my heavy head fall back against the seat and closed my eyes. I recalled Trey’s handsome face, his kind hazel eyes and the little bump on his nose that told me it’d once been broken. “Look, Trey, I don’t want to lay a guilt trip on you, but you should know that my mother meant a lot to Cary. She was like a surrogate mom to him. He’s really hurting a lot right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “I’m sorry to hear that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant to call you … before.” I curled my legs up beneath me. “To see how you’re doing, but also—well, there’s more. I wanted to tell you that I know you have to do what’s best for you. That said, if you’re thinking at all that you might want something with Cary, you should make up your mind quickly. The door is closing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess. He’s seeing someone,” he said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, just the opposite. He’s taking some time for himself and reevaluating what he wants. You know he broke it off with Tatiana, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what he says.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t trust him to tell the truth, it’s good you broke things off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.” He made a low frustrated noise. “That’s not what I meant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cary’s healing, Trey. Pretty soon, he’s going to be ready to move on. It’s just something you need to think about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I’ve done is think about it. I still don’t know what the answer is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed the space between my brows. “Maybe you’re asking the wrong question. Are you happier with him or without him? Figure that out and I think the rest will become clear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what it’s worth, you and I kinda took the same route. Gideon and I always said we were going to make it work, but that was … I don’t know …” I searched through my brain fog. “Bravado. Stubbornness. That was part of our problem, we knew it was a house of cards. We weren’t taking the steps to make us solid. Does that make sense?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we both made big changes, just like Cary has for you. And big concessions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my husband enter the room and opened my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was worth it, Trey,” I said softly. “It’s not wishful thinking anymore. We’ll still hit bumps, people will throw us some curve balls, but when we say we’re going to get through anything, it’s nothing but the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re telling me to give Cary another chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out to Gideon, felt a soft stirring in my chest as he came to me. “I’m saying I think you’ll like the changes he’s made. And if you meet him halfway, you might find it’s worth the trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris left for the evening shortly after six to have dinner with Christopher. For some reason, he and Gideon exchanged a long look as my husband showed him out. I let it go without asking for an explanation. Their relationship had shifted. The wariness they used to regard each other with was gone. There was no way I was going to question it or make Gideon think too hard about it. It was time for him to make some decisions with his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad and Cary left around nine, heading back to my old apartment, since there was room for both of them there and not enough in the penthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould my dad stay in the bedroom where he’d last made love to my mother? How would he bear it, if he did? When Gideon and I had been apart, I’d had to stay at Stanton’s. My room had too many memories of Gideon and the last thing I needed was to be tormented with reminders of what I wanted more than anything, yet feared I couldn’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon went around the penthouse, turning off lights, Lucky following him every step of the way. I watched my husband move, his tread heavier than usual. He was so tired. I had no idea how he’d managed to get through the day, considering how busy he’d been in the morning’s aftermath—coordinating with Kristine, answering the occasional call from Scott, and catching Arash up on the visit with the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angel.” He held his hand out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at it a moment. All day long, he’d offered me his hand. Such a simple thing, really, but it was powerful. I’m here, it said. You’re not alone. We can do this together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising from my seat on the sofa, I linked my fingers with his and let him lead me to the bedroom and into the bathroom. There, I went through nearly the same routine as he did. Brushing my teeth, washing my face. He added the step of taking one of the pills Dr. Petersen had prescribed. Then I followed him into the bedroom and let him undress me, before sliding another T-shirt over my head. He tucked me in with a soft, slow kiss. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-137.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
