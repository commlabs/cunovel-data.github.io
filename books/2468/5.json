{"id":82057,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eTHE city morgue was in the basement at Vancouver General Hospital. Henry supposed it worked on the same principle as the crypts under cathedrals-the deeper in the ground, the cooler the ambient tempera?ture, the less chance of the rot seeping into the rest of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHospitals had never been one of Henry\u0027s favorite places. Not because of light levels kept painfully high for eyes adapted to darkness. Not even because of the omnipresent and unpleasant odor of antiseptic mixed thoroughly with disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hung in the halls like smoke; from the patients who knew they were dying, from the patients who feared they were dying. That modern medicine re?sulted in far more successes than failures made little difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePredators preyed on the weak. The defenseless. The despairing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he had already fed, the Hunger strained against Henry\u0027s control as he stepped over the threshold and into the building. His reaction wasn\u0027t about feeding; it was about killing, killing be?cause he could, because they were all but asking him to. As the door closed behind him, he could feel civili?zation sloughing away, exposing the Hunter beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d decided to gain access through Emergency, reasoning that he could hide his movements in the chaos that always seemed to exist in the ER of big city hospitals. As far as it went, the reasoning was sound, but the bloodscent hanging over the crowded waiting room came very close to loosing the Hunger. Acutely conscious of the weak and injured around him, their lives throbbing in an atmosphere reeking of despair, Henry stepped away from the door and moved deeper into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one tried to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who saw him quickly looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassing as swiftly as possible through the crowded emergency waiting room, he slipped unnoticed into the first stairwell he found. The air was clearer there, but he had no time to compose himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolklore aside, vampires not only showed up in mir?rors but in security cameras as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are times, he thought, racing down the stairs at full speed, a dark flicker across a distant monitor, when I hate this century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo flights down, he opened a door marked, CITY MORGUE/PARKING LEVEL TWO and stepped gratefully into a dimly lit corridor. While he suspected that budget cuts were the reason for two out of three fluorescent banks to be off-there\u0027d be no patients wandering about down here after all and, given the hour, few staff-it was hard not to appreciate the at?mosphere created by the lack of light. The hall leading to the morgue should be barred with shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth bared but more comfortable than he\u0027d been since leaving his car, Henry followed the trail of death to an unlocked door. Pulling on a pair of leather driv?ing gloves, he passed silently through an outer office and into the actual morgue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, he breathed easier still. In these rooms, the blood spilled was lifeless and the dead were past fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly six of the refrigerated drawers were in use. Five were labeled with the occupant\u0027s name. The sixth held the body of the handless man pulled out of Van?couver Harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face had taken a beating-although it was un?clear whether it had happened in the water or be?fore-but enough areas of definition remained for Henry to recognize his ghost. Had he any doubts, the fuzzy blue homemade tattoo of a dripping dagger on the left forearm would have convinced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough there were computer files as well, paper copies of recent autopsy reports were stored in a huge filing cabinet against one wall of the office. It only took a moment to match the number on the drawer with the number on the file folder and a moment more to set the first page on the photocopier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the jangle of keys in the hall the instant after he pushed print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKevin Lam tossed his car keys from hand to hand as he hurried down the corridor. It had been one hell of a shift and all he wanted to do was go home, eat something that didn\u0027t taste like disinfectant, and see if maybe there was a ball game on. He didn\u0027t actually like baseball that much, but a ten-hour shift had left him so brain dead he figured it had the only plot on the tube he\u0027d be able to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027m in the car, I\u0027m safe. They can\u0027t call me back. I can go home. Eyes locked on the entrance to the parking garage at the end of the hall, he almost missed the flash of light from the morgue office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe supposedly deserted morgue office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frosted glass in the upper half of the door was dark. From the hall outside, it seemed that no one was working late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who the hell is running the photocopier?\" Kevin glanced toward the parking garage and sighed. If he called hospital security, he could be stuck here for hours even if it turned out to be nothing. And if it did turn out to be nothing, he\u0027d be the butt of every morgue joke in the hospital. \"I\u0027ll just open the door and turn on the light, see that it\u0027s nothing, and then go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if it is something? he asked himself as he shoved his keys in his pocket and reached for the door. He shook his head. Yeah, right. Like someone\u0027s actually going to be standing in a dark morgue at mid?night making photocopies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry had plenty of time to hide. He just didn\u0027t bother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the instant the orderly stood silhouetted in the open door, one hand reaching for the light switch, Henry grabbed the front of his uniform, dragged him into the room, and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunger roared in his ears, restraints rubbed raw by Vicki\u0027s presence, then further torn by his pas?sage through the massed despair and bloodscent in the building above. Self-preservation barely held him in check as he shoved the young man down onto a desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t completely black in the room. LEDs gleamed on various pieces of equipment and an exit light glowed over the door. Kevin saw the pale oval of a face bend over him, felt himself fall into the bot?tomless depths of dark eyes, and choked back a scream when a cold voice told him to be silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrong fingers gripped his wrist, the touch both chill?ing and burning, sensations racing up his arm with his pulse and causing his heart to pound. His breathing quickened. It might have been fear. It might have been something darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t understand when the pale face withdrew and that same cold voice muttered, \"And I accused her of acting like a child.\" When the face returned, when the voice told him to forget, he forgot gladly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony had left just after Henry had. She\u0027d sent Celluci to bed at about two. All the lights were out except a small crescent moon lamp on a shelf in the entryway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the curtains open, the city spilled into the living room, banishing anything approaching darkness for those who lived at night. Having carefully moved two days\u0027 worth of unopened mail to one side, Vicki sat at the mahogany desk staring down at a blank piece of paper and waiting for Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d be back soon. He had to be if he wanted to give her any chance to study the autopsy report and maybe come to a few conclusions before dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she thought about waiting for Henry, she was fine. When she started thinking about what Henry was, her thoughts were tinted red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he always had been-he wasn\u0027t the one who\u0027d changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fidgeted with the heavy fountain pen she\u0027d found in one of the desk drawers, turning the smooth black weight over and over, the repetition vaguely soothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. I\u0027m not what I was, but I\u0027m still who 1 was. I accepted the limitations of the RP-okay, not gracefully, honesty forced her to admit, but I accepted them. I didn\u0027t let it keep me from living my life exactly as I pleased. I am here to find a murderer, and I\u0027m not going to let Henry Fitzroy change the way I operate. He\u0027s my friend, and we\u0027re going to act like friends if I have to rip him open and feed on his steaming entrails!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pen snapped between her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing heavily, Vicki barely kept herself from throwing the pieces aside and spraying a room full of very expensive upholstery in ink. Trembling with the effort, she set both halves of the pen gently in the middle of the desk then surged to her feet and vi-ciously kicked the chair away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a small voice in the back of her head won?dered where the hell this was coming from, she headed for the door, the Hunger rising. Eyes gleaming silver in the mirror wall of the entry, she reached for the doorknob and realized another heart beat in unison with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corridor. Almost at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen memory added Celluci\u0027s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomance writer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki grabbed onto that and used it to bludgeon her instinctive response back into the shadows. Her breathing slowed and the roaring in her ears dimmed to a gentle growl. Vampires did not share territories with other vampires, but there was nothing that said vampires could not share a territory with romance writers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tony had said. It was an attitude thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if there\u0027s one thing I excel at, it\u0027s attitude. Hold?ing tightly to that thought, she opened the door and said, \"What the hell took you so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry recoiled a step at her proximity, eyes darken?ing, a snarl pulling his lips back off his teeth. \"Don\u0027t push it, Vicki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey . ..\" She spread her hands, the gesture serving a double function of emphasis and of readiness should she need to go for his throat. \"I just asked you a question, you\u0027re the one who\u0027s overreacting.\" Some?how it came out sounding like a challenge which was not at all what she\u0027d intended. It had been easier with the door between them; face-to-face, her visceral reac?tion to the threat he posed was harder to ignore. \"Look, Henry, it was getting late, I was getting wor?ried; okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you\u0027re old and slowing down...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Where the hell did that come from? Shaken, Vicki shoved the thought back into her subconscious. \"Forget it. What did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting was safer for them both than responding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d seen the threat surface, seen her push it away. Considering the short time she\u0027d spent in the night, her control was nothing short of incredible. A faint hint of jealousy, that she should so easily push aside the demands of her nature, added itself to the emo?tional maelstrom below his barely achieved surface calm. \"The ghost has a body. As requested, I made a copy of the autopsy report and added a full description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" Her fingers crumpled the yellow file folder and, stepping backward, she closed the door between them once again. Acutely aware of the mo?ment he lingered, when she finally heard him walk away and go into his own condo, she sagged back against the carved cedar. \"So much for the romance writer defense.\" Old instincts told her to follow and patch things up. New instincts told her to follow and destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning on the door, she breathed deeply until his scent had been thoroughly mixed with the nonthreatening, expensive potpourri scent of the apartment. \"This is really starting to piss me off. Nothing runs my life like this. Nothing!\" Returning to the desk, she slapped the creased file folder down on the polished wood. \"I am going to beat this... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trapped the tag behind her teeth. Under the circumstances, adding \"if it kills me\" seemed a little too much like tempting fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the hall, Henry stood staring out at the West End, rubbing his throbbing temples. It could have been much worse-he\u0027d expected it to have been much worse. Neither of them had actually attacked, and their conversation, while short, had been essen?tially civil. It was beginning to look as though Vicki had been right all along. Perhaps the old rules could be changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, coyotes had been solitary hunters for centuries and they were learning to hunt in packs. One corner of his mouth quirked up as he remembered a recent news report of coyotes eating household pets in North Vancouver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On second thought, perhaps that\u0027s not the most flattering of comparisons,\" he murmured to the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s strength had surprised him, although he sup?posed it shouldn\u0027t-her strength came from who she was, not what. After he worked past the jealousy, he found a tenuous faith in that strength beginning to push aside his expectations, beginning to allow him to have faith in himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desire to throw her out of his territory in bleed?ing chunks persisted, but, for the first time, he realized the feeling didn\u0027t necessarily have to be acted upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly hopeful, he headed for the shower to wash off the lingering stink of the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, wake up. We need to talk before sunrise.\" Only experience allowed her to translate his mumbled response as \"I\u0027m awake,\" but since his eyes remained closed and his breathing had barely changed, she chose not to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than use borrowed bedding, he\u0027d rolled his sleeping bag out in the center of the king-sized bed but hadn\u0027t bothered to zip it up. Kneeling by his side, Vicki reached through the gap and wrapped her fin?gers around the warmest part of his anatomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ, Vicki! Your hands are freezing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned, having jerked back too quickly for his wild swing to connect. \"Now you\u0027re awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit.\" Squinting past her, he managed to focus on the clock beside the bed. \"4:03. That\u0027s just great. Whatever we need to talk about had better be fuck?ing important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You actually heard me say we needed to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I was awake.\" He yawned and dragged in another pillow to prop up his head. \"So what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s our case, then we should discuss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t have left me a note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, and let you sleep?\" Picking up the file folder from the end of the bed, she crossed her legs and started to read. \"Henry\u0027s ghost was a male Caucasian between twenty and twenty-five, a smoker who proba?bly died of a beating he\u0027d received sometime before he went into the water, who\u0027d had a kidney surgically removed within the last month which was not, by the way, what killed him. After death, his hands, wrists, and about two inches of forearm were removed, prob?ably with an ax. His body was later found in Vancou?ver Harbor.\" She frowned down at the photocopy of the autopsy pictures. \"We can assume, since he\u0027s still lying unnamed in the morgue, the police scanned his picture into the system and didn\u0027t find a match. At this point, there\u0027re three things they should be doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrows raised at her phrasing-he\u0027d just bet the Vancouver police would love to hear what they should be doing-he indicated she should continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They should be showing the photographs around at different hospitals, hoping someone can ID him from the kidney perspective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve thought of that,\" Celluci muttered. \"Can\u0027t be a lot of places around that take out kidneys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends on what you\u0027re calling around,\" Vicki re?minded him. \"This guy could\u0027ve been anywhere in the world just hours before he came to Vancouver and got killed.\" Grinning, she smacked him on the chest with the file folder. \"Fortunately, we know something the police don\u0027t. The body was naked when they pulled it out of the water, but according to Henry\u0027s description, his ghost is wearing a T-shirt advertising a local band. We can ignore everything outside this immediate area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then shouldn\u0027t we tell the police this guy\u0027s local?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn case you\u0027ve forgotten, withholding evidence is a crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Let\u0027s tell them.\" She mimed dialing a phone. \"Hello? Violent crimes? You know that handless John Doe you\u0027ve got in the morgue? Well, he\u0027s local. How do I know? His ghost is appearing to this vampire friend of mine, and he identified a T-shirt.\" Hanging up an imaginary receiver, she snorted. \"I don\u0027t think so. Anyway, they should also be investigat?ing this tattoo.\" She passed over a page of photocop?ied pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, turned on a light, and studied the collec?tion. \"He\u0027s pretty beat up. Henry ID from the tattoo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince her tone suggested he not ask why, he merely handed back the page. \"Looks like a street job. Not much to go after. And thing three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They should be checking out the gang connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why do you think they took off his hands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci shrugged. \"Somewhere his prints are on file.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then so\u0027s his picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not looking like that it isn\u0027t.\" He fanned the pho?tocopies. \"The computer isn\u0027t going to spit out a match to a face like that and looking through mug shots takes so much time no one has that it becomes real low priority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they took off his hands because they wanted to use them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead man\u0027s prints?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a possibility. And organized crime ties into your organ-legging theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! It\u0027s not my theory,\" he protested. \"I just re?peated what I heard on that cable show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It adds up, Mike. Organized crime\u0027s always looking for new ways to make a buck. They provide bodies so that the rich can buy organs for transplant, then, in their own warped version of reduce, reuse, and recy?cle, they use the hands to print weapons for hits. It even explains why the body was found in the harbor. The Port Authority is fully unionized, and unions have always had ties to organized crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? When Jimmy Hoffa disappeared, he moved to Vancouver?\" Celluci tossed the papers down on the bed and jerked both hands back through his hair. \"You\u0027re really reaching, Vicki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, forget the unions. But I still say the sim?plest explanation is usually the right explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s a simple explanation?\" he asked, the incredulous tone only slightly exaggerated. \"And in case you haven\u0027t noticed, there\u0027s only been one body. Not many bucks made there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only been one body found. Either they\u0027re just getting started and their disposal\u0027s still a bit sloppy, or this one got caught in the wrong current. Either way, no one\u0027s going to set up something so complicated for just one kidney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the kidney has anything to do with the murder and isn\u0027t just a coincidence. You remember those, don\u0027t you Vicki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored him. \"Besides, we have to start some?where, and God knows, we\u0027ve got bugger all else to go on. I\u0027ll look into the gang aspect tomorrow night. Given the recent rise in Chinese immigrants, odds are good there\u0027s a triad presence at the very least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, I can\u0027t argue with that... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth made a sarcastic moue. \"Poor baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... but I think perhaps if all this is what the police should be doing, maybe we should leave it to the po?lice. You know as well as I do, that the last thing the investigating officers are going to want is some out-of-town PI-and an out-of-town cop on vacation,\" he added hurriedly when her eyes started to silver, \"-butting in where they don\u0027t belong and screwing up the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Normally, I\u0027d agree with you.\" She frowned at his expression of patent disbelief. \"I would. Unfortu?nately, Henry\u0027s ghost seems pretty specific about Henry avenging him, so we have to find the murderer before the police do or Henry could be playing twenty questions with the dead for eternity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m willing to risk it,\" Celluci snorted, rather en?joying the possibility of Henry Fitzroy backed into a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why should a ghost care who avenges him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell should I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t allow Henry to play vampire vigilante.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s asking you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too early in the morning for that argument.\" He half-covered a yawn. \"But we\u0027ll have it, I promise. Hell\u0027s going to freeze over before I let Henry take the law into his own hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\" Vicki asked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because he\u0027s done it before, doesn\u0027t make it right.\" Prodded by his conscience, Celluci shifted un?comfortably in place. The lines between justice and the law had a tendency to blur around Henry Fitz?roy-he didn\u0027t like it, but so far he\u0027d done absolutely nothing to stop it. Where, he wondered, do I draw the new line?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing deeply, he peered up at Vicki, wishing she\u0027d move into the circle of the light so he could see her expression instead of just the pale oval of her face. \"I take it that I\u0027m to run a few daylight errands for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, one finger tracing lazy circles in his chest hair. \"I want you to ask that cable interviewer why she thinks it\u0027s organ-legging. What\u0027s she basing her theory on? Maybe she knows something, or has heard something... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe she\u0027s making it up as she goes along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. And you\u0027re right... \" She smacked him as he recoiled in pretend shock. \"... the missing kid?ney could be coincidence, but I\u0027d still like to hear her reasons for bringing it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if her reasons had more to do with ratings than facts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we still have the gang angle to work on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gleam in her eyes evoked another deep sigh. \"You\u0027re looking forward to doing some shit-dis?turbing, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still a lousy liar, Vicki.\" Reaching out, he enclosed her hand in his. \"Try to remember you\u0027re immortal, not invulnerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki leaned forward and covered his mouth with hers. A few heated moments later, she pulled back just enough for speech. \"I\u0027ll be careful if you\u0027ll admit my theory might be valid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know me, I always keep an open mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flicked his lips with her tongue. \"If you weren\u0027t such a good liar, I might even believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alarm went off at 5:00. Ronald Swanson reached up to slap it off before he remembered it wasn\u0027t bothering anyone but him. Sinking back against his pillows, he smoothed nonexistent wrinkles out of the far side of the big bed and thought about the phone call he was about to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasic groundwork had been laid for months. Details had been worked out by a trusted employee back East last night. This morning, he would close the deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would probably be safer to distance himself from that as well as from the donors, but he couldn\u0027t. A personal touch, his thumb never leaving the pulse of the company, had made him an obscene amount of money, and successful habits were hard to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it,\" he muttered, throwing back the single blanket and swinging his legs out of bed. His feet imprinting the plush carpet with each step, he strode into the en suite bathroom, habit clos?ing the door behind him before he switched on the light. In the dark, empty bedroom, the clock said 5:03.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony? It\u0027s Mike Celluci. I didn\u0027t wake you up, did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony blinked wearily at the clock on the bookshelf and dragged himself up against the back of the sofa bed. \"Yeah. You did. It\u0027s only eight. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only eight.\" The repetition arrived complete with an implied and weary, kids. \"Aren\u0027t you working today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but not till ten.\" He yawned and scratched at the near stubble covering his head. \"I got lots of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I need to know the channel of the cable show I was watching yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cable show?\" Staring across the den at the multipane window partially hidden behind hanging plants, he got lost in an attempt to figure out if the ripples were in the glass or in his vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was on yesterday evening before Henry came home. Patricia Chou was interviewing a businessman named Swanson about kidneys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\" Beginning to wake up, he decided the ripples were in the glass. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci\u0027s voice came slowly and deliberately over the phone line. \"What channel was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the name, Tony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony yawned again, suddenly remembering why he\u0027d never liked Detective-Sergeant Celluci very much. \"I think it\u0027s called The Community Network. Anything else? You like want me to make an appoint?ment for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks; but keep your ears open today. If, as Vicki\u0027s current theory insists, there\u0027s a gang actually organ-legging ...\" His tone made it clear he consid?ered that highly unlikely. \"... there\u0027ll be a buzz of some kind on the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, but I\u0027ll be spending eight hours in a video store, and the only buzz I\u0027m likely to hear today is while I\u0027m rewinding weekend tapes returned by incon?siderate assholes who can\u0027t read the contracts they signed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to get there and get home. And you\u0027ve got to eat lunch. Vicki says you\u0027re the best, Tony. If there\u0027s a buzz out there, you\u0027ll hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheeks hot, Tony mumbled an agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My apologies to your hosts if I woke them as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping the receiver back on the cradle, Tony stretched and wished he could erase his personal tapes as easily as the ones at the store. In spite of how far he\u0027d come, some reactions still seemed impossible to control. \"I get a pat on the head and I\u0027m just like a fucking stray dog.\" He sighed, drew in a lungful of air redolent with the aroma of freshly brewed hazelnut cream coffee, and decided he might as well get up since either Gerry or John was obviously in the kitchen. Pulling on a T-shirt to go with the boxer shorts he\u0027d slept in, he realized he was going to enjoy having someone to share breakfast with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially since he wasn\u0027t on the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Community Network was in the basement of a three-story, sloped-roof building on the corner of Tenth Avenue and Yukon Street just in back of City Hall. Which made a certain amount of sense, Celluci figured as he cruised slowly along the block looking for parking, since most of their business seemed to be concerned with broadcasting city government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might as well stay close to the source,\" he muttered, adding, \"Lousy son of a bitch,\" through clenched teeth as a smaller and infinitely more maneuverable vehicle nipped in front of him, taking the only empty spot he\u0027d seen. While not as kamikaze as driv?ers in Montreal, Vancouver drivers were anything but laid back. Although he hated to do it, he ended up leaving the van in a municipal lot and only cheered up when he remembered that Henry\u0027d be paying the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine steps down, more at half-ground than base?ment, The Community Network reception area had been painted a neutral cream and then covered in fly?ers, memos, messages, and posters of every descrip?tion. The woman at the desk had four pencils shoved through her hair just above the elastic securing a strawberry-blonde ponytail and was taking notes with a fifth. It sounded as though she was dealing with a scheduling conflict, and her end of the phone conversation grew less polite and more emphatic as the call progressed. From what he could hear, Celluci had to admire the amount of control she managed to maintain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, bottom line, what you\u0027re saying is that the councillor won\u0027t have time for an interview until the current session is over?\" Her notes disappeared be?hind heavy black cross-hatching. \"But after the session is over, we won\u0027t need to speak with the councillor about the zoning change because it\u0027ll be over, too. Well, yes, I\u0027d appreciate it if you\u0027d get back to me.\" The receiver went back into its cradle with a little more force than necessary. \"You sanctimonious little kiss-ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, she looked up, smiled broadly at Celluci, and said, \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d consider forgetting you heard that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned the smile with a deliberately charming one of his own. \"Heard what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Now then, what can we do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to speak to Patricia Chou.\" When her expression started to change, he continued quickly. \"My name\u0027s Michael Celluci. I called earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, she mentioned you.\" Standing, she held out her hand. \"I\u0027m Amanda Beman. Her producer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a grip that reminded him of Yield\u0027s-Vicki\u0027s before she gained the unwelcome ability to break bones. \"Do producers usually work reception?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? With our budget, I also work the board and empty the wastebaskets. Come on.\" Pencils quivering, she jerked her head toward a door adorned with only two sheets of paper. Given the cov?erage on the surrounding walls, it was essentially bare. The upper piece read: If there\u0027s no one at the desk, please ring the bell. The sign underneath it declared, in pale green letters on a dark green background: BELL OUT OF ORDER. PLEASE KNOCK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re a lot busier later in the day,\" Amanda ex?plained as she led the way along an empty corridor. \"Our morning programming\u0027s all educational tapes from UBC, so we operate with a bare minimum of staff until about noon.\" She shot him a wry glance. \"And little more after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet Ms. Chou was here first thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be here last thing, too. Our little Patricia would like to be Geraldo Rivera when she grows up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you were here... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am always here.\" Stopping in front of an un?marked steel door, she raised a hand and lowered her voice. \"You must have been pretty persuasive to get Patricia to talk to you at this hour, and you look like you can handle yourself, but I couldn\u0027t live with my conscience if I didn\u0027t warn you about a couple of things. First, if she invites you to call her Patricia, that\u0027s exactly what she means. Patricia, never Pat. Sec?ond, nothing you tell her is off the record. If she can find a use for it, she will. Third, if she can find a use for you, she\u0027ll use you as well, and, given that you\u0027re not exactly hard on the eyes, it might be smart to present a moving target.\" She rapped on the door and stepped aside, motioning for Celluci to enter. \"Good luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like I should be carrying a whip and chair,\" he muttered reaching for the door handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cyanide pill might be more practical,\" Amanda told him cheerfully. \"We need her. We don\u0027t need you. Remember, keep moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the door closed behind him, he heard her hum?ming, \"Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead,\" then he heard nothing at all as the heavy steel cut off all sound from the hall. So I can assume no one will be able to hear me if I scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room had originally been one large cinderblock rectangle, but bookcases had been used to divide it into two smaller work spaces, one considerably smaller than the other and windowless besides. Betting on what seemed like a sure thing, he walked into the larger of the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman working at the computer terminal didn\u0027t acknowledge his presence in any way although she must have heard both her producer\u0027s knock and his entrance. Celluci got the impression that it wasn\u0027t a deliberate slight but rather that he simply wasn\u0027t as important as her work in progress. Marginally more insulting upon consideration. After a dozen years in police work, however, insults meant little unless ac?companied by violent punctuation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands clasped behind his back, he looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBookcases made up not only the dividing wall but covered two of the other three and rose to the lower edge of the windows on the third. Their contents seemed about equally divided between books, videos and binders with a number of framed photographs propped up in front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatricia Chou accepting something from Vancou?ver\u0027s Mayor. Patricia Chou being congratulated by the current Premier of British Columbia. Patricia Chou with a serenely smiling man Celluci recognized as the right-to-lifer who\u0027d put a high velocity, 7.62-mm rifle bullet into a 57-year-old obstetrician because he ob?jected to the doctor performing legal abortions at city hospitals. Although Ms. Chou was still smiling in that particular photograph, her expression as she gazed at the handcuffed gunman seemed to suggest she\u0027d just squashed something unpleasant she\u0027d found under a rock and was happy to have done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective-Sergeant Celluci personally believed the world would be a significantly better place and his job one hell of a lot easier if the victims were given the kind of coverage criminals usually got and if criminals were ignored by the press, their names and pictures never appearing outside of rap sheets and court docu?ments. He didn\u0027t approve of giving them time on talk shows no matter how local the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Michael Celluci.\" When he turned, she tossed a silken fall of midnight hair back over her shoulder and continued before he had a chance to speak. \"You wanted to talk to me about yesterday\u0027s show.\" Her tone suggested he not waste her time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudying her face, Celluci discovered what the cam?eras had camouflaged; she was young. Not long out of university. Not long enough for the sharp edges of ambition, intellect, and ego to have been dulled by the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot like Vicki when they first met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeen there. Done that. Got the scars. \"As I said on the phone, Ms. Chou, I have a friend who wants to know why you think the body found in Vancouver Harbor was an organ-legging victim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And as I said on the phone, I\u0027d like to know why your friend wants to know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friend thinks much the same thing you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend is the only other person in the city who does. You don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci shrugged, the gesture carefully neutral. \"I try to keep an open mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An open mind?\" The repetition fell barely to one side of mockery. \"Why doesn\u0027t your friend want to talk to me? Why send you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Busy,\" she repeated, her eyes narrowing. Leaning back in her chair, she stared at him for a long moment then one ebony brow lifted. \"You\u0027re not with the local police department, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe matched her brow for brow, beginning to regret giving her his real name. \"What makes you think I\u0027m with any police department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, your gaze is constantly going flick, flick, flick around the room. Second, in spite of styles, your cuffs are loose enough to access an ankle holster. Third, although it\u0027s less obvious in person, over the phone your voice mannerisms are pure law enforcement. Forth, you\u0027re not local or you would have identified yourself earlier.\" Her gaze grew fiercely speculative, almost sharklike. \"You\u0027re federal, aren\u0027t you? This is bigger than I thought, isn\u0027t it? Maybe even international.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer ambition burned so brightly he could almost feel the heat. If Tony\u0027s theory was correct, and Patri?cia Chou was looking for a story big enough to get her a network show, she seemed to believe-for reasons unclear to Celluci at the moment-that this was the story. Although who the hell she thought he was, he had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I tell you what your friend wants to know,\" she continued, leaning forward, eyes blazing, \"I get exclu?sive rights to this story when it breaks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci sighed. \"Ms. Chou, there might not be a story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exclusive rights,\" she repeated with no room for negotiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew when to surrender-especially when it didn\u0027t make a damned bit of difference to him. In his opinion, there was as much chance of the John Doe in Vancouver Harbor having been killed by organ-leggers as there was of Henry Fitzroy winning the Governor General\u0027s Award for fiction. \"All right. The story\u0027s yours.\" Raising a cautioning hand, he added, \"As soon as there is a story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and sat back. \"So you want to know why I think that missing kidney is the reason for the young man\u0027s murder. Simple, there\u0027re a lot of people who need them, giving an organ-legger a large data?base to chose their buyer from-a database that\u0027s fairly easily tracked given that every one of them is on dialysis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute.\" An uplifted hand cut her off. \"You said buyers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re hardly going to give them away, Mr. Celluci. And, considering that it can lead to infections, stroke, heart attacks, and peritonitis, I think I can safely say dialysis sucks. I\u0027m sure they could find peo?ple willing to pay big bucks to get off it. What\u0027s more, because kidney transplants have a 98% success rate, you can pretty much guarantee your product. Which is why they only took a kidney and not the heart and lungs and corneas and all the other things people so desperately need. The left kidney-the one missing from the body-is the one most often used for trans?plant purposes. Also, it\u0027s one of the easiest transplants to perform, giving you a larger database of doctors to choose from, and the more doctors you have, the bet?ter the odds you\u0027ll find one who can be corrupted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s two completely different computer systems to access; it can\u0027t be that easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are the \u002790s, Mr. Celluci. Twelve-year-olds are hacking into international defense systems every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, he couldn\u0027t argue with that. \"The newspaper reported that the surgery to remove the kidney was well on the way to being healed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up a pencil and bounced the eraser end against her desk. \"Your point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think they kept him alive for so long? Why not just take the kidney and let him die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I expect that they kept him alive long enough to be certain that the buyer\u0027s body didn\u0027t reject the kid?ney. If it did, well, with him still around, they\u0027d have a spare and could try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why remove the hands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fingerprints.\" Her tone added a silent: Don\u0027t play dumb with me. \"An identity makes it much easier for the police to gather the information that could lead to the person or persons responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what does Mr. Swanson have to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swanson was just the mouthpiece of the BC Trans?plant Society. I was trying to get someone in a per?ceived position of expertise to admit the possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Chou apparently had an answer for everything, but that was by no means a complete answer. She reminded him more of Vicki every second. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned a little forward, and her teeth showed between parted lips. \"And I\u0027ve decided I don\u0027t like him. When I was researching him for that interview, I discovered that not only is he filthy rich but he has absolutely no bad habits. He works very hard, he gives a lot of money away, and that\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rich aren\u0027t allowed to be nice, hardworking people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not these days. Now, I\u0027m not saying he\u0027s a part of this organ-legging thing, but he certainly has, as you people would say, motive and opportunity.\" She raised one emphatic finger after another. \"His wife died of kidney failure waiting for a transplant. He has more money than most governments, and with enough money you have the opportunity to do everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He also seems to think this organ-legging thing isn\u0027t possible. His arguments made a great deal of sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back and waved a dismissive hand. \"They would, wouldn\u0027t they? Did you know he funded a pri?vate clinic where people in the last stages of renal failure can wait for a kidney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci spent a moment hoping she\u0027d never decide she disliked him. \"No, I didn\u0027t. I take it the police found your theories less than helpful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips curled into a sneer. \"The police as much as accused me of sensationalizing an urban myth for the sake of personal gain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could they possibly have come up with that idea? Celluci asked himself dryly. \"You\u0027ve a lot of conjecture, Ms. Chou, but no facts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what does your friend have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe half smiled, acknowledging the hit. \"More con?jecture. But she also says that since we have bugger-all else, we have to start somewhere. Thanks for your time.\" Holding out his hand, he added, \"The moment we get a fact, I\u0027ll let you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand disappeared in his and yet gave the im?pression that she was fully in charge of the gesture. Standing, she was a great deal shorter than her person?ality suggested. When she smiled, she showed enough teeth to remind him that many of the people he\u0027d run into over the last couple of years weren\u0027t exactly human. \"See that you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was pleasantly enough said, but a threat for all of that. Dick me around, and you\u0027ll be the story. It won\u0027t be fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder other circumstances, he might have reacted differently, but short women made him vaguely un?comfortable, so he merely showed himself out-count?ing on his fingers in the corridor to make sure he\u0027d gotten them all back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, he was sitting in the van going over what he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA handless body short one surgically removed kid?ney had been found in Vancouver Harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatricia Chou\u0027s information on why the kidney could have gone to an illegal transplant was entirely plausible even if her dislike of Ronald Swanson was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganized crime did have a history of using dead men\u0027s prints which would explain the missing hands. And Vicki was right about organized crime always looking for a new way to make a buck. Some sort of criminal bodyshop made more sense than a well-respected, socially conscious businessman selling used organs like they were high-priced radios ripped out of parked cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Patricia Chou, there was a market out there for kidneys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResting his forehead against the top curve of the steering wheel, Celluci closed his eyes. Great, now they\u0027ve got me beginning to believe it.... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-debt-vicki-nelson-5/page-5.html","bookId":2468,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:50 PM"}
