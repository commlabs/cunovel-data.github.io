No greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than good and bad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No people could live without first valuing; if a people will maintain itself, however, it must not value as its neighbour valueth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and contempt by another: thus I found it. Much found I here called bad, which was there decked with purple honours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Never did the one neighbour understand the other: ever did his soul marvel at his neighbour’s delusion and wickedness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A table of excellencies hangeth over every people. Lo! it is the table of their triumphs; lo! it is the voice of their Will to Power.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is laudable, what they think hard; what is indispensable and hard they call good; and what relieveth in the direst distress, the unique and hardest of all,—they extol as holy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whatever maketh them rule and conquer and shine, to the dismay and envy of their neighbours, they regard as the high and foremost thing, the test and the meaning of all else.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, my brother, if thou knewest but a people’s need, its land, its sky, and its neighbour, then wouldst thou divine the law of its surmountings, and why it climbeth up that ladder to its hope.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Always shalt thou be the foremost and prominent above others: no one shall thy jealous soul love, except a friend”—that made the soul of a Greek thrill: thereby went he his way to greatness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To speak truth, and be skilful with bow and arrow”—so seemed it alike pleasing and hard to the people from whom cometh my name—the name which is alike pleasing and hard to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To honour father and mother, and from the root of the soul to do their will”—this table of surmounting hung another people over them, and became powerful and permanent thereby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To have fidelity, and for the sake of fidelity to risk honour and blood, even in evil and dangerous courses”—teaching itself so, another people mastered itself, and thus mastering itself, became pregnant and heavy with great hopes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, men have given unto themselves all their good and bad. Verily, they took it not, they found it not, it came not unto them as a voice from heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Values did man only assign to things in order to maintain himself—he created only the significance of things, a human significance! Therefore, calleth he himself “man,” that is, the valuator.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Valuing is creating: hear it, ye creating ones! Valuation itself is the treasure and jewel of the valued things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Through valuation only is there value; and without valuation the nut of existence would be hollow. Hear it, ye creating ones!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Change of values—that is, change of the creating ones. Always doth he destroy who hath to be a creator.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Creating ones were first of all peoples, and only in late times individuals; verily, the individual himself is still the latest creation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peoples once hung over them tables of the good. Love which would rule and love which would obey, created for themselves such tables.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Older is the pleasure in the herd than the pleasure in the ego: and as long as the good conscience is for the herd, the bad conscience only saith: ego.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, the crafty ego, the loveless one, that seeketh its advantage in the advantage of many—it is not the origin of the herd, but its ruin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loving ones, was it always, and creating ones, that created good and bad. Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues, and fire of wrath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: no greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones—“good” and “bad” are they called.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, a prodigy is this power of praising and blaming. Tell me, ye brethren, who will master it for me? Who will put a fetter upon the thousand necks of this animal?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A thousand goals have there been hitherto, for a thousand peoples have there been. Only the fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking; there is lacking the one goal. As yet humanity hath not a goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But pray tell me, my brethren, if the goal of humanity be still lacking, is there not also still lacking—humanity itself?—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61029.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
