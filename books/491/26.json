I had just learned through my friend Wilson that someone had told Wing that you associated with a disreputable young man and that was the reason you did not get the job. I guessed at once that it was Stover. Wilson admitted it was he. I wanted to know if you had been with any other men so that I would know how to talk to Stover. When I talked to him he said that he didn\u0027t mean his nephew, so there wasn\u0027t anyone for him to mean but me. I went to Wing then and confessed that I was the disreputable young man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I just knew that you had something to do with my getting that job. Of course Stover spoke that way of you because you belong to the Klan.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, he pretends so; but the real reason is because he can\u0027t use me or bribe me. As I told you before, Stover is a crook and one of these days I will prove it to you and to the world. I know why you lost your job at the bank. It was on my account, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t have to answer, do I?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No. I know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want to thank you for helping me get the job and especially for setting me right in the estimation of Mr. Wing. I certainly appreciate it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was a great pleasure to be of some little assistance to you, but I am the one who is indebted for a job. You are the one who secured me my chance. How can I repay you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who\u0027s been tattling?\" she asked, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your friend, Miss Welty, told me the last trip I made to the capital.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She\u0027s a piker; she told me she wouldn\u0027t tell.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, she didn\u0027t exactly tell. I got her to admit it. She said that you talked like a professional salesman in selling me to her father.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It wasn\u0027t difficult. You see I had a good article to sell. When your goods have real merit it isn\u0027t hard to make a sale.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ruth, I am leaving tonight.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you be gone long?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am not sure. At least four or five days. I have to go early to get ready. I did not want to go without having a little visit with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Once before when you were leaving we pulled a wishbone.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, and you won and made three wishes. You haven\u0027t told me yet what you wished.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, they haven\u0027t all come true yet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can tell me about the ones that have come true, can\u0027t you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, not yet. If I were to tell you now that would break the charm and the others would not come true. Say, do you want to pull another wishbone? I\u0027ve got one in here, but there isn\u0027t any meat on this one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, we don\u0027t want the meat on it when we pull it. Come on, let\u0027s wish.\" She went into the kitchen and secured the wishbone. \"This is a small one,\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It should be good for two wishes,\" he said, \"if the other was sufficient to carry three.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right, here goes for two wishes.\" He took every advantage in the hold that he secured and the quick twist that he gave it when she was ready. He won, and she said, \"That wasn\u0027t fair; you cheated.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You won the other time,\" he replied, \"and it was my time to win.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said he must leave, and she accompanied him to the front porch. He said good-night and took several steps down the walk, then turned back and talked a while longer. \"Well, I must go,\" he said, but he remained ten minutes more. Finally he screwed his courage to the sticking point, leaned over and kissed her cheek. She playfully slapped him, as she said, \"You naughty boy.\" The combined effect of the kiss and slap sent him away happy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After leaving Ruth, Harold had only time enough to pack his grip and make the California Limited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The same day that Ruth had given Harold the description of Dick Watson, he sent the description to the heads of the Klan in every state in the union. Within a week three million secret service men were looking for the missing bank cashier. This afternoon Harold had received a telegram informing him that his man had been located by Klansmen in Arizona.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89893.html","bookId":491,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM"}
