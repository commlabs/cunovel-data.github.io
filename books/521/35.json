{"id":27844,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35 Thibault","content":"After kissing Elizabeth good-bye at the door, Thibault collapsed on the sofa, feeling both drained and relieved. He reveled in the knowledge that Elizabeth had forgiven him. That she\u0027d tried to understand and make sense of the convoluted journey he\u0027d taken ro get here seemed nothing short of miraculous. She accepted him, warts and all—something he\u0027d never thought possible. Before she left, she\u0027d invited him for dinner, and though he\u0027d readily agreed, he planned to rest up before he went. He somehow doubted that he\u0027d have the energy for conversation otherwise. Before his nap, he knew he needed to take Zeus out, at least for a little while. He went to the back porch and retrieved his rain suit. Zeus followed him outside, watching him with interest. \"Yeah, we\u0027re going out,\" he said. \"Just let me get dressed first.\" Zeus barked and leapt with excitement, like a prancing deer. He raced to the door and back to Thibault again. \"I\u0027m going as fast as I can. Relax.\" Zeus continued to circle and prance around him. \"Relax,\" he said again. Zeus fixed him with a beseeching gaze before reluctantly sitting. Thibault donned the rain suit and a pair of boots, then pushed open the screen door. Zeus bounded out into the rain, immediately sinking into the muddy ground. Unlike Nana\u0027s place, his property occupied a slight rise; the water collected a quarter mile away. Up ahead, Zeus veered toward the forest, then back to the open area again, then circled around to the graveled driveway, running and bounding in sheer joy. Thibault smiled, thinking, I know exactly how you feel. They spent a few minutes outside, wandering in the storm. The sky had turned charcoal, heavy with rain-burdened clouds. The wind had picked up again, and Thibault could feel the water stinging his face as it blew sideways. It didn\u0027t matter; for the first time in years, he felt truly free. At the base of the driveway, he noted that Elizabeth\u0027s tire tracks had nearly washed away. In a few more minutes, the rain would smooth them away completely. Something snagged his attention, though, and he tried to make sense of what he was seeing. His first thought was that the tires that had left the tracks seemed too wide. He walked over for a closer look, reasoning that the set of tracks she\u0027d left going out had probably overlapped the set coming in. It was only when he stood at the edge of the drive that he realized he\u0027d been mistaken. There were two sets of tracks, both leading in and out. Two vehicles. At first, it didn\u0027t make sense. His mind began to click quickly as the puzzle pieces slid into place. Someone else had been here. That didn\u0027t make sense, unless… He glanced toward the path that led through the forest to the kennel. At that moment, the wind and rain unleashed in full fury, and he squinted before his breath caught in his throat. All at once he took off at a nan, making sure to pace himself. His mind raced as he ran, calculating how long it would take to get there. He hoped he would make it in time.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59659.html","bookId":521,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 2:23:27 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 2:23:27 AM"}
