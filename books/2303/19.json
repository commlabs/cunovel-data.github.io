And what I\u0027m \u0027doing\u0027 is no concern of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to argue with you some more,\" Alex said, smothering a yawn, \"but I\u0027m beat. I made myself at home in the guest room. Hope you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little late to be asking, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her. \"That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you destroy a vampire and her mortal lover here in LA?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, how\u0027d you know about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"That kind of news travels fast, you know that. You were careful, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always careful,\" he said with a wink. \"See you in the morning, little sister. Oh, and I\u0027d like eggs, bacon, and French toast for breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have whatever you want. The frying pan is in the drawer under the stove.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny.\" Whistling softly, he headed down the hall toward the guest room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stared after him. Her domineering big brother was one complication she definitely didn\u0027t need in her life right now. She chewed on her thumbnail. She should have warned Alex that Rhys had his scent, but then Alex would start asking questions she didn\u0027t want to answer. Questions she couldn\u0027t answer unless she wanted Alex to know that Erik was indeed a vampire, just as he suspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYawning, she grabbed the smaller of her two suitcases and carried it up to her bedroom. Maybe things would look better in the morning, she thought as she unpacked her nightgown and got ready for bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys prowled the dark underbelly of the city. Though he no longer needed to feed as often as he once had, he was addicted to the chase. Life didn\u0027t hold much excitement for a man who had lived as long as he had, but hunting...ah, that never grew old. He chose a different kind of prey for each hunt--one week he might decide to stalk only blondes, the next week, only brunettes. Another week he might prey on nothing but young males, then on females. He could be as discriminating as he chose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, he was hunting only women between the ages of twenty and thirty who had black hair and blue eyes and who were exactly five feet tall. Thus far, he hadn\u0027t had much luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thinking he would have to redefine his search when Erik appeared beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What brings you here?\" Rhys asked, unable to completely mask his surprise. All of the West Coast vampires had their own hunting grounds. Trespassing on another\u0027s territory was forbidden and had, on occasion, led to bloodshed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt the need of some company,\" Erik said, falling into step beside the other vampire. \"What\u0027s on the menu tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black-haired females with blue eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik grunted softly. \"Any luck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\" Rhys lifted his head, his nostrils flaring as he caught the scent of prey. \"But I think my luck\u0027s about to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s blond,\" Erik said. \"A streetwalker. And very young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how would you know that?\" Rhys asked, his eyes sparking red with anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I passed her on my way here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering, \"All cats are gray in the dark,\" Rhys moved quickly down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of his head, Erik followed him, though at a slower pace. Coming here had seemed like a good idea at the time, but now...he swore softly, thinking that Daisy\u0027s brother couldn\u0027t have shown up at a worse time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hunger stirred as the scent of blood drifted on the wind. Up ahead, he could see Rhys standing in the shadows, his head bent over the neck of the blond hooker. Apparently the Master of the City wasn\u0027t averse to altering the cuisine he had chosen for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys looked up as Erik approached. A vampire caught in the midst of feeding was rarely a pretty sight, and Rhys was no exception. Blood dripped from his fangs; his eyes burned red. He growled softly, warning Erik to stay away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik took a step backward. Folding his arms across his chest, he watched Rhys drink his fill and in so doing, Erik understood why he was there. It was to remind himself of what he was, what he was capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile watching Rhys feed, Erik knew Daisy had been right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere could be no future for the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy awoke on Monday morning to the deliciously mingled aromas of fresh-brewed coffee and frying bacon. She frowned, momentarily disoriented. This wasn\u0027t her bedroom at Erik\u0027s, she thought groggily, and then remembered that she was home and that it had to be Alex, cooking in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering under her breath, she headed for the shower, wondering how long Alex intended to stay, and how she could persuade him to leave sooner if he was planning to stay more than a day or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter pulling on a pair of faded jeans and a blue Mickey Mouse sweatshirt, she padded barefoot to the kitchen door. Pausing a moment, she took a deep breath, pasted a smile on her face, and entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, good morning, sleepyhead,\" Alex greeted her cheerfully as she stepped into the room. \"I wasn\u0027t sure what you were in the mood for, so...\" He gestured toward the stove. \"I made a little of everything. You take what you want, and I\u0027ll eat the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy glanced at the counter and shook her head. He had made a little of everything, all right. There were plates of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, waffles, buttered toast, and a ham and cheese quiche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, there\u0027s enough food here to feed a family of six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m famished. Do you want coffee, milk, tea, juice, or hot chocolate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing there was no point in arguing, Daisy sat at the table. \"Juice and coffee will be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex carried all the plates to the table, then slid onto the chair across from hers. \"Dig in, sis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy helped herself to a couple of pancakes, two strips of bacon, and a helping of scrambled eggs. \"You really are a good cook,\" she remarked. \"If you ever get tired of taking heads, you could probably open a restaurant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex snorted softly. \"Where\u0027s the fun in that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the fun in taking heads?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not in the taking,\" Alex said, speaking around a mouthful of eggs. \"It\u0027s in the hunting. You know how it is, the way your mouth goes dry and your heart beats with excitement...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With fear, you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fear, excitement, whatever it is, it makes you know you\u0027re alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027ve never thought of doing anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Alex said, looking surprised. \"Why? Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy shrugged. She had considered finding another line of work from time to time. Since destroying Saul, she\u0027d been thinking of it even more, but she was reluctant to admit it, especially to her gung-ho brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s because of that vampire you killed, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way. It made me feel good, knowing I could defend myself if I had to, but...\" She pushed her plate away, her appetite suddenly gone. \"I killed a man...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t a man,\" Alex said curtly. \"He was a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he was a man once,\" Daisy insisted. \"If it wasn\u0027t for me, he\u0027d still be alive or undead, or...\" She threw up her hands. \"The point is, I killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Daisy, vampires aren\u0027t human any longer. You know that. And you can\u0027t kill them. They\u0027re already dead, remember? The only reason they aren\u0027t fish-belly white and six feet under is because they exist on our blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I sell theirs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting back in his chair, Alex crossed his arms over his chest. \"All right, Daisy Mae, what\u0027s this all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy glared at him. Even though it was a long-standing joke between them, she hated it when he called her Daisy Mae. Usually, she reciprocated by calling him Little Abner, but this morning, she wasn\u0027t in the mood for levity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t tell him the truth, of course; she couldn\u0027t tell her brother that it was her feelings for Erik that were making her doubt her chosen line of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this have anything to do with that guy that was here last night? That artist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" Using her fork, she pushed the eggs around on her plate, careful not to meet her brother\u0027s eyes. \"Why would it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Alex leaned forward, his arms folded on the table, his brow furrowed. \"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not like you,\" Daisy said. \"I can\u0027t kill someone, destroy someone, and tell myself it doesn\u0027t matter. Taking their blood...\" She shrugged. \"It seemed like a bizarre game at first, finding their lairs, sneaking in, stealing their blood, leaving without a trace. But now...now it just seems wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They kill us, Daisy,\" Alex said quietly. \"They don\u0027t just take our blood. They take the lives of innocent men, women, and children. We aren\u0027t people to them, we\u0027re prey. They\u0027re all monsters, and the worst of them lives right here, in LA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy\u0027s heart skipped a beat. \"What do you mean?\" she asked, praying he wasn\u0027t talking about Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Master of the City,\" Alex said. \"Rhys Costain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief washed over Daisy. \"Is he the reason you\u0027re here?\" she asked, careful to keep her voice and her expression impassive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I came because Mom and Dad were worried about you. It\u0027s just a coincidence that the vampire I\u0027m hunting lives in the same city you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you hunting him? Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve run out of vampires in Boston?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-19.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
