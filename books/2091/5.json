Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I know? I\u0027d dreamed the face of a man who\u0027d been dead for a century and a half. I\u0027d found a bad-luck voodoo flower in my bed. I was in Louisiana searching for a werewolf, for crying out loud. I shouldn\u0027t be let loose without a keeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie tugged on my arm. \"Let\u0027s get outta here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were ice-cold. Poor kid. I took pity on him and went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we hurried across the grass, I wondered aloud, \"The photo was the only thing left in the house. Wouldn\u0027t someone have stolen it by now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie leaped from the dock to the boat. \"I dunno.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove the boat as if we were being chased, then dumped me back where he\u0027d found me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We still on for tonight?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Swamp I got no problem with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie left with a roar of the motor, sending a huge wave over both the dock and my sneakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned to the hotel, where I discovered my flower was gone. I\u0027d have figured the maid disposed of the thing, except my room hadn\u0027t been cleaned yet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am,\" the girl insisted when I tracked her down. \"I haven\u0027t gotten to your floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That\u0027s my responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could be lying, but why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I let myself back into my room, my cell phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been meaning to call him but kept getting distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you find?\" he demanded without the courtesy of a hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what to say. I hadn\u0027t found anything except a voodoo flower and a picture of a ghost. Neither one had any bearing on what Frank had hired me to do. So instead of answering his question, I asked one of my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you write the name Adam Ruelle next to the guide\u0027s information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t tell you?\" Frank sighed. \"My mind is not what it used to be, I\u0027m afraid. Ruelle land has been the favored territory for the loup-garou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering Ruelle land was basically a swamp, except for the small area where the house had been built, I could see why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you rent the mansion?\" I asked. \"I\u0027d like to use it as my base of operations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet I could,\" Frank said slowly. \"Great idea. You\u0027re going to find the loup-garou; I\u0027m sure of it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said dryly. \"You understand, don\u0027t you, Frank, that the possibility of discovering a werewolf is pretty slim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight up there with the possibility of there actually being one, but I wasn\u0027t going to tell him that He was paying my salary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Frank said. \"But mere\u0027s something there. Something new and exciting. Can\u0027t you feel it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could, and I was both frightened and fascinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see Ruelle?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the locals,\" I murmured, \"he\u0027s been missing for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit! He\u0027s there, and he knows something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get uneasy about Frank. \"Have you met this guy?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"Not him. His... father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have any information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seems to be going around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find me the werewolf, Diana. I need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank hung up, and when I redialed his number, I got voice mail. I wondered again about the accident that had made him a recluse. Had he fallen on his head? Why would he need a werewolf?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and pocketed my cell phone. Until his checks became as bent as he was, I\u0027d just keep doing what Frank had hired me to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith several hours until I met Charlie, I took a stroll down Bourbon. My feet led me to Royal Street, and from there to a tiny shop tucked back from the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped inside. The contrast between heated sunshine and cool shadow, frantic noise and a certain peace, made me dizzy. I caught the scent of herbs, spice, heard the trickle of water somewhere in the distance, and music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot jazz or even the blues. Something folksy with drums. A tune that was as ancient as time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a sense someone was watching me, which seemed to happen a lot lately, and was making me increasingly paranoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doorway covered with beads of many colors led into the back. I saw nothing beyond their plastic sheen, which was, I\u0027m sure, the whole idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward the retail section of the store, took three steps, and stopped. Someone wasn\u0027t watching me; something was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge, coiled snake occupied a cage in the corner, its eyes black and unblinking. Eyes of the dead. Long, brown, with uneven black circles all over its body, the reptile appeared to be a python. Was that even legal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched away. The cage looked secure enough, but I didn\u0027t want to get him excited. There were plenty of other items to view in the snake-free section of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelves full of bottles, bowls, which were in turn full of... stuff. With none of it marked, I was clueless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral mini cloth sacks stuffed with Lord knows what lay on the countertop. I brushed my fingertip across one of them, and I could have sworn it shimmied on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gris-gris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my gaze to the woman standing in front of the beaded doorway. How had she come through without making them go clackety-clack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved behind the counter, picking up one of the bags. \"A gris-gris, meaning charm or talisman. For good luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lack of an accent revealed her to be as much a stranger here as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad luck?\" In my memory banks gris-gris meant \"cursed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in my shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shop. This was Priestess Cassandra?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d expected her to be African-American, or perhaps Haitian, since voodoo had taken root and grown there. She\u0027d wear a turban, a flowing dress, bangles on her wrists, huge hoops in her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Cassandra was a tiny blue-eyed white girl with a single streak of gray marring the right temple of her short, black hair. Hair that appeared to have been hacked off recently, by someone who did not know what they were doing. To my amazement, the style complemented Cassandra\u0027s high cheekbones and pointed chin, softening them just enough to nudge her toward stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dressed in ratty jeans, a pink T-shirt, and her feet were bare, except for the rings on two of her toes. If not for the premature gray, I would have mistaken her for a coed at Tulane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a question?\" she asked. \"Something bugging you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You psychic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was sweet, as if I were a child, though I had to be older than her by several years. \"Everyone is at times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted, then realized how rude that was. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread her hands. \"We believe what we believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if I was in town searching for a werewolf, that didn\u0027t mean I bought into voodoo and other mind games. I had my standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do have questions,\" I said. \"Doesn\u0027t everyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some have answers.\" I lifted a brow and she laughed. \"But not many. How can I help you... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head, waiting for me to introduce myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moon goddess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stilled at the tickle of a memory. I\u0027d heard that before, or something like it, in my dream last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra studied my face. \"You didn\u0027t know the meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, but my parents named me after my grandmother. Knowing them, there wasn\u0027t any discussion of the moon involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regardless, names have power and purpose. Cassandra means prophet\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How... convenient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again, as if I were the funniest person to come into her shop in years. I took in the herbs, the beads, the snake. Maybe I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHissing erupted from beyond the chicken wire. \"Relax, Lazarus. She\u0027s a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lazarus? As in risen from the dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Names have power,\" was all she said. \"What\u0027s your question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at the snake, which was staring at me again. The idea that the reptile might not die or, if dead, would rise, was a very creepy thought indeed. Weren\u0027t zombies a part of the whole voodoo thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd snake zombies... Well, I didn\u0027t even want to go there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a flower in the swamp,\" I said. \"A fire iris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Cassandra moved down the row of shelves and began to pull out a little of this and a little of that, sprinkling the unknown items into a gris-gris bag. \"Very powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it mean when someone leaves one on your bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, fingers poised over a basket of what appeared to be dried chicken bones. Then, as if she\u0027d had second thoughts, she took a pinch of red dust instead and scattered it on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not \u0027welcome to the neighborhood,\u0027\" she murmured. \"Can you bring me the flower?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat \"It\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.\" She turned to a completely different set of shelves and continued to mix and match. \"Another question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t answered the first. Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know anything about a wolf in the area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand froze above a glass jar of what looked like black olives but probably weren\u0027t \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. Di - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not your name. Why are you here? In New Orleans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a cryptozoologist. I was hired to find the wolf in the swamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my job. Finding unknown animals\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wolf isn\u0027t unknown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Louisiana it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if there isn\u0027t a wolf? Or at least not a wolf as you know them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast me a quick glance, then busied herself tying a string around the top of the gris-gris. \"There\u0027s a legend about the Honey Island Swamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The swamp monster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer derisive hiss was echoed by the snake in the cage. \"Nothing more than an overgrown nutria rat, which scared some half-wits over two decades ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting theory - and one that explained the legend nicely. Cassandra was both refreshingly levelheaded and disturbingly strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant the legend of the loup-garou,\" she continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we were getting somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve heard the tale.\" She stared at me for a long moment \"But you don\u0027t believe mere\u0027s any such thing, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored her question to ask one of my own: \"Have you seen a wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra moved to the front window and peered at the street \"There\u0027s something out there. Something that comes and goes. Something that kills and is never caught\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves don\u0027t kill people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, and her now-sober eyes met mine. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the legend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my world, legends often skirted the truth. I needed to listen, to analyze, to pick and choose what was real and what was not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over a hundred years ago a man was cursed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a man. Isn\u0027t that enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked. I really shouldn\u0027t like her so much. If she wasn\u0027t nuts, she was at least a charlatan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every crescent moon he runs as a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much I knew; the question was -\u0026nbsp; \"Why not the full moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A loup-garou is special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an awful lot of questions for someone who doesn\u0027t believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was cursed,\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I sounded like a broken record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he owned people, and he would not set them free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlaves.

An evil thing, ruled by the moon and possessed by bloodlust. They\u0027re given life, but they can\u0027t live. They can hate, but they can\u0027t love. They think like a human and kill like a beast, no longer caring about anything or anyone but themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I didn\u0027t want to meet one in a dark alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the crescent moon and not the full?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides the fact that this is the Crescent City?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank had mentioned that. I\u0027d thought it nothing more than an interesting coincidence. However, when dealing with curses, coincidences weren\u0027t always so coincidental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I believed in curses, but some people did. Obviously Cassandra was one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The full moon comes but once a month,\" she continued. \"The crescent arrives twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Double your cursing pleasure,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra nodded. \"A full moon is technically one night only, but each crescent lasts several days, bestowing multiple madness every lunar cycle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was this guy? Simon Legree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated that the first name of my beloved husband and that of the legendary bad guy from Uncle Tom\u0027s Cabin were the same, but I hadn\u0027t written the book and Harriet Beecher Stowe had died long before I had a chance to complain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody knows for certain who the man was,\" Cassandra said. \"In the way of legends, he was probably an amalgamation of every slave owner. Doomed to be damned for eternity by their own greed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe a werewolf is running around the Honey Island Swamp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe there is; maybe there isn\u0027t.
