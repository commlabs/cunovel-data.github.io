I went mad. I served my enemies. They became my only friends.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\"Since then, I\u0027ve traveled back and forth across this galaxy, and out to the spaces between galaxies--a greater reach than any human before me. \" \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\"You have asked me to tell you about that time. Since you are the last true Reclaimer, I must obey. Are you recording? Good. Because my memory is failing rapidly. I doubt I\u0027ll be able to finish the story.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\"Once, on my birth-world, a world I knew as Erde-Tyrene, and which now is called Earth, my name was Chakas...\" \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn the wake of apparent self-destruction of the Forerunner empire, two humans--Chakas and Riser--are like flotsam washed up on very strange shores indeed. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eCaptured by the Master Builder, misplaced during a furious battle in space, they now find themselves on an inverted world where horizons rise into the sky, and where humans of all kinds are trapped in a perilous cycle of horror and neglect. For they have become both research animals and strategic pawns in a cosmic game whose madness knows no end--a game of ancient vengeance between the powers who seeded the galaxy with life, and the Forerunners who expect to inherit their sacred Mantle of duty to all living things. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn the company of a young girl and an old man, Chakas begins an epic journey across a lost and damaged Halo in search of a way home, an explanation for the warrior spirits rising up within, and for the Librarian\u0027s tampering with human destiny. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThis journey will take them into the Palace of Pain, the domain of a powerful and monstrous intelligence who claims to be the Last Precursor, and who now has control of both this Halo and the fate of Forerunners and Humans alike. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eCalled the Captive by Forerunners, and the Primordial by ancient human warriors, this intelligence has taken charge of, and retasked, the Master Builder\u0027s cruel researches into the Flood--which it may have itself unleashed on the galaxy more than ten thousand years before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-primordium-halo-9.jpg","author":"Greg Bear","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/halo-primordium-halo-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:20 PM"}
