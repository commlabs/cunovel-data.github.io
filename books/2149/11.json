I could only imagine how Brandon would be feeling today, given his struggle with us last night. I called and texted him obsessively but didn\u0027t get a response. I got dressed and hurriedly drove to his house, but it didn\u0027t appear that anyone was home. I knocked on his guesthouse door and the main house door, but no one answered. Even Apollo wasn\u0027t barking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if his entire family had picked up and left town. Or did Brandon flee the area or not come home and they were out looking for him? I was worried. My mind was overcome with worst-case scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" began to play. I scrambled for my cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon?\" I asked, breathless. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste?\" a man\u0027s voice answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Maddox?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I wanted to call you and say thank you for your help last night. You are braver than I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . you are welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I think the medical profession would be lucky to have you, though I\u0027m not sure how many patients will struggle like my son did last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is Brandon?\" I asked, worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed a huge sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to talk to you first,\" he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your help, Dr. Maddox, and I\u0027m sure Brandon does, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a pause and another voice in the background. \"Celeste,\" Brandon said into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon, are you okay?\" I asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"Now that I am talking to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI melted hearing the comfort of his sexy voice. \"How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little moody, but I know a cure for that. It\u0027s seeing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meet me at Willow Park tonight?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have a real date,\" he said. \"This time without my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hummed, sang, and whistled the whole way to the park. It was going to be a date to remember. It was the third day of the full moon. It was the last day in this cycle that Brandon would turn into werewolf form. And if we were lucky and his father could make an antidote, then this might be the last time I saw him in werewolf form forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, Dr. Meadows\u0027s words still haunted me. But if Brandon was really dangerous, wouldn\u0027t he have bitten me already? Last night, he could have bitten me or his father - and with all his anger, he still hadn\u0027t. That\u0027s not who Brandon was as a human or as a werewolf. He was kind and generous and ultimately so magnetic that the thought of being apart from him made me physically upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carried a basket with a picnic dinner for us - a baguette sandwich with layers of roast beef, along with two sodas and chocolate cupcakes I\u0027d made and topped with plastic wolves. I\u0027d tied a pink scarf around the handle of the basket to add a little flirty romantic flare. I wanted to bring something special for my hot carnivore. I headed out early, just before sunset, so I could set the scene in the woods before he arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I drove through the twisting roads, I noticed a car following me into the parking lot. I caught sight of it in my rearview mirror. It was a familiar Beemer. Nash had followed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of my car in a huff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to ask you the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash. You can\u0027t follow me everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste, I can\u0027t let you put yourself in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The full moon will be out soon. Please, come with me.\" He grasped my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Nash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m going to have to tell Ivy and Abby - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Nash. I want to tell them. They are my friends. The truth needs to come from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you admit it. He\u0027s really a werewolf!\" Nash seemed shocked by my statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - I admit that I\u0027m dating him. And I\u0027m happy to tell them.\" I\u0027d been keeping Brandon\u0027s and my romantic relationship a secret for Brandon\u0027s sake - so he wouldn\u0027t be more tormented at school if Nash proclaimed he\u0027d seen the Westsider\u0027s transformation. But the part about Brandon truly being a werewolf - I wasn\u0027t planning on telling anyone about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a full moon tonight and it\u0027s almost dark, Celeste,\" he said. \"I\u0027m really asking you as your friend - come back with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m asking you, as your friend, to let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste - we don\u0027t have to get back together - \" he said. \"It\u0027s not about that anymore. It\u0027s about you. Please. I don\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was as sincere as I\u0027d ever seen him. This was different from when he had tried to charm me to get another kiss. He was really pleading with me not to go - for my sake, not his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t just stand here and watch you walk into a darkened place to meet a werewolf,\" he said. \"Are you insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I was, if Brandon had been like what people might expect a werewolf to be. Dr. Maddox, Dr. Meadows, and Nash were concerned for my safety. So why was I so sure Brandon would be different? Maybe I\u0027d been so blinded by love that I couldn\u0027t see the forest through the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused. For a moment I really reflected. Nash was my friend, my first crush. A guy I\u0027d known for years. He was happy and handsome and well liked. Brandon was an outsider, a guy whose father was now afraid of him, and a werewolf. It wasn\u0027t very logical, but I knew I had to follow my heart - and that would lead me into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from Nash and made my way to the end of the asphalt before he stopped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are just going to walk into this forest alone?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t reply. He already knew the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered in my basket - noticing the contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are these the things a werewolf eats?\" he asked, the sun setting behind him. \"What if it\u0027s you he\u0027s planning to eat for dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deer shot out from the woods a few yards away from us. It stopped along a wooded brush near our cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" I said. \"It\u0027s beautiful out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But you should be enjoying it with me, not some circus freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you never wanted to do these things,\" I charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do now,\" Nash said sincerely. \"And I want to do them with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped in front of me, blocking me from going any farther toward the woods, and then I noticed a pair of gray eyes a few feet behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my hand to him. \"Uh . . . you need to stay still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash and I were between a wolf and his prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me how I should behave,\" he said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash, I\u0027m serious.\" I spoke softly, my voice quavering. \"There is something behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you pranking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wolf,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I know you\u0027re pranking!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung around so quickly that he startled the wolf. It growled low and fierce. Nash gasped and, in the motion, twisted and lost his footing. He stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf must have thought Nash was attacking. The animal sprang forward and within a heartbeat had taken Nash\u0027s arm in its mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash yelled a horrible, gut-wrenching yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed and dropped the basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash tried to kick the wild wolf away, but it kept its jaws clamped on his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed again as I searched the area for a branch or anything to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then I heard another howl from the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf\u0027s ears perked up, and he released Nash. Nash yanked his arm away and stepped back from the wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf stared at Nash and growled as Brandon raced out of the woods and jumped between Nash and the wild wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon stared at the wolf with such fierce intensity that the wild animal retreated in fear, backing away slowly before turning and loping off into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was very relieved but still scared, and tears streamed down my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Brandon asked me, resting his hands on my shoulders and looking at me squarely. His gray eyes stared down at me. I could barely nod my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not,\" I said, pointing to Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon noticed blood dripping from Nash\u0027s arm and ran to the basket. He untied the scarf from the wicker handle and handed it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that thing was going to kill me,\" Nash said, in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all right now,\" I said, trembling. \"It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tied my silk scarf around Nash\u0027s arm, just like I\u0027d done to Brandon in the wintry woods. The pink scarf was quickly dotted bloodred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was clearly shaken. The things he feared most in life - wolves - had attacked him. Maybe he had a sense about them all his life. Legend\u0027s Run was known for a wolf population, but Nash wasn\u0027t a hunter, and before this school year, we hadn\u0027t seen any up close and personal. I always found his fear to be odd, but it was one of the things that made Nash vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed Nash\u0027s back as he was, understandably, still visibly shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, man,\" Brandon said. \"You\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you look so different,\" Nash said. \"You look like a wolf yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon cracked a smile, exposing two sharp lycan fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better drive him to the hospital,\" Brandon instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon didn\u0027t have time to kiss me good-bye before he disappeared into the woods. His gray eyes shone through the edge of the woods as I drove Nash out of the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of spending a romantic date with Brandon in the woods, I hung out with Nash and his family at the hospital while he got his wounded arm stitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the handsome jock might never admit it, I knew he was grateful to Brandon for saving him from the wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was tested for rabies, and the doctors said we would know within a few hours if he was infected. But it wasn\u0027t rabies that gave me cause for concern. I thought that Nash might be safe because he didn\u0027t have the werewolf blood that Mr. Worthington had talked about having in his own ancestry running through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr did he? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-11.html","bookId":2149,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM"}
