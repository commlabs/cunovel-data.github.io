What do they want this time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I know you, don\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDOWNSTAIRS IN THE LOBBY, GRACE LOCKED the door of the ladies\u0027 room. Removing her black wig and eyeglasses, she stepped out of her police uniform, folded it neatly and placed it in the toilet cistern. Only after she\u0027d replaced the lid of the cistern and straightened her own clothes did she collapse onto the floor and cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Not Lenny. Not my Lenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my own sister?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast her mind back. Lenny and Connie had always gotten along. They were kindred spirits in a way, both tough, both ambitious. The opposite of me. She remembered the pair of them dancing at the Quorum Ball, deep in conversation. Connie arguing with Lenny on the beach in Nantucket, then storming off in tears. I thought he was comforting her, because of Michael. Because of all the money they\u0027d lost. How could I have been so blind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace didn\u0027t care about Connie. Her sisters were long since dead to her. But Lenny! Grace\u0027s memory of their marriage, of Lenny\u0027s love for her, was the one true thing she had left in this world. Without that, there was no hope, no meaning, no point to any of it. Without that love, the anguish was unbearable. She cried out to the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lenny. Tell me it isn\u0027t true!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Grace heard nothing, only the echo of her own words in the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJASMINE SMILED AT THE HUNKY BLOND COP. Usually she only went for wealthy men. But in Detective Mitch Connors\u0027s case, she might be persuaded to make an exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to talk about your relationship with Senator Warner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. Although I\u0027m not sure how much more I can help you. I already told your colleague everything I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch frowned. \"My colleague?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. She was just here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was asking me all about Jack, and what happened on Nantucket the weekend that Lenny Brookstein disappeared. Didn\u0027t you send her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch\u0027s mouth went dry. He bolted for the elevator, pounding his fist on the call button. It seemed to take forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I wait, or take the stairs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed open the emergency exit door and bounded down the stairs, three at a time. Bursting into the lobby, he looked around. Empty. He ran out to the street, frantically looking to the left and right. Fifth Avenue was busy. The street was choked with afternoon traffic and the sidewalk was full of people. Mitch weaved among them holding out his badge like a talisman, grabbing every petite woman he came across, scanning the features of every female he passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace Brookstein was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-25.html","bookId":2373,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM"}
