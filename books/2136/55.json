{"id":95201,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere were four us in the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was holding Tara\u0027s hand. The two of them sat closely together, sharing, perhaps, the world\u0027s most unusual bond: both had been possessed simultaneously by a nasty son of a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley occasionally patted my knee, and I let him. The gesture seemed to come from a source of support, not flirtation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, I had called my sister and confirmed that they were all okay in a safe house. The safe house was, apparently, Kingsley\u0027s ski lodge in Arrowhead. I hadn\u0027t known Kingsley had a ski lodge in Arrowhead. Either way, all was well, and I breathed a sigh of relief and told them to sit tight for another day or so. I would explain it all later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had emerged from the mausoleum as naked as the day I was born and covered with blood - and completely healed. The headless body of Conner Thurman had done something extraordinary before my very eyes: it had literally gone up in smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo weird, I thought now, as Kingsley patted my leg again. Tara cried softly as Allison hugged her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison had been outside the mausoleum, drenching wet and freezing and briefly confused. I helped her back to the bungalow where we changed into some dry clothes. Once done, she and I watched a very unusual procession: Thurman after Thurman emerged from the surrounding woods. All soaked to the bone. All lost. All confused. Some were even hurt. But none permanently so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley emerged, too, carrying Edwin in his arms. The young Thurman had taken the worst of Kingsley\u0027s efforts to fend them off. Edwin, as far as I knew, was resting in his basement room now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurting, but okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, we had explained to Tara what had happened to her and her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news was, unsurprisingly, devastating. She looked at me now. \"I hate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. Outside, the storm had subsided. The trees were no longer threatening to break at their bases. A light rain drifted by the big windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate him for what he did to my family. We couldn\u0027t fight him. We didn\u0027t know how. He manipulated our thoughts, our memories, our words, our actions. We were all his puppets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recalled the Source\u0027s words: There is no evil, Samantha Moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure I believed it. I had seen evil firsthand, and I believed it was real. I had seen the joy on the entity\u0027s face - or Conner Thurman\u0027s face - as it delivered blow after blow, breaking me and my body. A body that had, miraculously, been restored once I had transformed back into my human self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even a cracked rib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t know that Conner Thurman was still alive?\" asked Kingsley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, although the memories of serving him in the mausoleum are returning now...\" she shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to know what \"serving him\" entailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He...he removed those memories from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley nodded. \"He\u0027s gone now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said. \"I felt him leave...and I felt him leave forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was nodding. She looked at me and Kingsley. \"I felt it, too. Granted, perhaps not as strongly as Tara, but suddenly, he was gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTara nodded absently. I suspected she felt the same, except I knew the trauma of her ordeal ran so deep and for so long, that she would need many months or years to come to terms with what had happened to her and her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thurman family had a lot of healing to do. After all, did they really know each other? How much of their lives had been controlled by the entity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know, but I did know that it was gone. I had seen it flee. To where, I didn\u0027t know. Perhaps another willing host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps even now it was cruising over the earthly plane like a diseased wind, looking for a willing partner...or perhaps even, an unwilling one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I thought. There is evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entity might be gone, but his sister was not. His sister was still within me, watching, waiting, existing. I shuddered all over again. Kingsley felt me shudder and patted me again. He added a small squeeze. Flirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior and Patricia Thurman next came into the room. Although Junior looked confused, he also looked vibrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoticeably absent - and perhaps most telling of all that the entity was indeed gone - was that his aura, along with Tara\u0027s and all the other Thurmans, was completely free of the black cord. The cursed black cord that had bound them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left Tara with her uncle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-55.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
