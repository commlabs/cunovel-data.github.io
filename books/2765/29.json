Marc tried to engage Avi in conversation, but Marc isn\u0027t the most interesting person to chat with. Get him on a subject he knows, though, and he\u0027s a maniac. Like real estate. He could talk about prime Chicago real estate for hours. It\u0027s too bad nobody wants to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner Avi and I get in the car and cruise back to the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going back to the beach?\" he asks. \"Because I think another late night like yesterday and your dad really will pull out the Uzi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s an Uzi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An Israeli-made machine gun. Very popular during your dad\u0027s time in the military.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I can see it. My dad waiting at the door sitting in the dining room chair with an Israeli machine gun strapped to his shoulder instead of just an angry stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. I\u0027m taking you to a club. You took me to a club in Israel. It\u0027s time for me to show you what clubs are like here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you had to be twenty-one to get into clubs in the States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, this one is lenient. Besides, I know the guy playing in the band.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbraham had such faith and fear in God he almost sacrificed his son Isaac because God commanded it (Genesis 22:2). Abraham knew God would make everything okay in the end. I have faith that God will make everything okay in the end too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wait in line to get into Durty Nevin\u0027s until Jess pulls us out of line and leads us to the front door. She mumbles something about her uncle being part owner of the security company responsible for the bouncers. We walk straight up to the burly bouncer, he takes one look at Jess, and waves the three of us in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold Avi\u0027s hand as we weave through the sea of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda is sitting at a table up front. She\u0027s wearing her hair up in a ponytail and has actual makeup on. \"Wow, Miranda, you look great!\" I say to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl smiles as if I just told her she won a million-dollar lottery. \"Jess did it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give Jess a thumbs-up sign, then join the others to snatch chairs for the three of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we sit, I reach for Avi\u0027s hand. His hand is already reaching for mine. Looking up, I swallow hard when he flashes me a private knowing wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you two worked it out, but if you start any major PDA I swear I\u0027m banning you from this table,\" Jess says, eyeing our hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s PDA?\" Avi says in my ear. Jess rolls her eyes, thinking he\u0027s whispering about how much he loves me and adores me and can\u0027t live without me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean toward him, my hand braced on his chest as I whisper back, \"Public display of affection. You know, making out in front of everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess is pulling me off him. \"I need to talk to you, Amy. It\u0027s important. If you could separate yourself from your man for one second, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing Avi an apologetic expression, I pry myself away and let Jessica pull me by my elbow into the hallway by the bathrooms. Music is blaring and pounding in my ears, but it sounds good. Anything would sound good to me right now. I\u0027m happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess is flushed as she stops and faces me. This is serious. I can tell by the way her mouth and stance get all intense and stiff. \"I\u0027m in love, Amy. And I know it sounds weird and I don\u0027t want to get all dorky and googly-eyed like you and Avi, but I know he\u0027s \u0027The One.\u0027 And my parents are going to have a complete meltdown when they meet him because he\u0027s everything they\u0027ve ever wanted for me. He\u0027s Jewish, he\u0027s Israeli, he\u0027s gorgeous, intelligent, he\u0027s sweeter than a cinnamon bun...he\u0027s every Jewish parent\u0027s wet dream--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand up, wondering what this is all about. Cinnamon bun? Israeli? Wet dream? \"Jess, the only Israeli you\u0027ve been in contact with lately is Avi and my dad. Avi is taken and my dad...\" I scrunch up my face in full gross-out mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not in love with your dad, Amy,\" Jess says, her hands on her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phew,\" I say, physically and mentally relieved. I just saved myself years of therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in love with Tarik. You know, Avi\u0027s friend at Northwestern. After your kidnapping fiasco, he drove Miranda and Nathan home. Then we talked in the car for over an hour in front of my building.\" I can\u0027t stop the girl or get a word in. She\u0027s like a train that won\u0027t stop. More like a train wreck, because she\u0027s totally clueless. I listen to the rest of her rant before breaking the bad news. \"He\u0027s the smartest guy, Amy. I can\u0027t believe you\u0027ve known him since the summer, knew he was coming to Northwestern, but didn\u0027t introduce him to me. I would question your loyalty to me, but I\u0027m so ridiculously in love. Did you ever think I would believe in love at first sight? I swear, I couldn\u0027t sleep last night thinking about him and this morning I had the biggest urge to go visit him and surprise him at the dorm. You know the way you feel about Avi? I feel the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I could talk now, Jess?\" I ask her. She laughs, this crazy I-am-in-love-and-can\u0027t-be-normal laugh. Gee, I hope I\u0027m not like that around Avi. Someone slap me please if I ever go over the deep end like that. \"What did you guys talk about for an hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything. Life, family, friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jess, I hate to break it to you, but...\" How do I tell her that 1: Love at first sight is a bunch of bull. And 2: He\u0027s--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. Before you tell me I\u0027m crazy and go off on me that I\u0027m supposed to be the friend who is realistic and sane, I need to know his last name. I don\u0027t even know my future husband\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muslim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess cocks her head to the side in confusion. \"Tarik Muslim? That\u0027s not a Jewish name, that\u0027s a religion. Amy, stop making fun of me and tell me his last name before I start getting pissed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s Muslim, Jess,\" I say slowly with a serious expression on my face. It\u0027s really a pity expression, because I\u0027m about to tell her that her cinnamon bun has raisins in it when she expected it to be plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, you said he was Israeli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I said he was Avi\u0027s friend from Israel. So as much as you like him, your parents would freak. Especially your dad. Isn\u0027t he the president of the men\u0027s club at the synagogue? I admit Tarik is awesome, Jess. But your parents want you to find a nice Jewish boy and I\u0027m sure his parents want him to find a nice Muslim girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t have put it like that. Just by looking at Jessica I can tell she\u0027s gone from elation to confusion to sorrow to defiance all in a matter of seconds. Defiance in my best friend is scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked me out on Saturday night,\" she says matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And of course I said yes. Crap,\" she says, as tears start filling her eyes. She turns and hurries into the restroom, leaving me to either go after her like a good friend or pay attention to my boyfriend who probably thinks I ditched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peek around the corner to check out what my boyfriend is doing. He\u0027s abandoned the table and is talking to a couple of guys at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to be a good friend and hope Avi can amuse himself for another five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the restroom, Jess has some other girls from our school gathered around her, asking what\u0027s wrong. Mitch cruelly dumped her and now the guy of her dreams turns out to be a guy she\u0027s probably forbidden to date. Jessica goes to Hebrew school twice a week, Sunday school, and in the summers Jess rides a bus all the way to the middle of Wisconsin to spend four weeks at a Jewish overnight camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say it\u0027s been ingrained in Jessica\u0027s head since she was born that she has to marry a Jewish boy. Her kids have to be Jewish, and it\u0027s her responsibility to carry on the Jewish traditions and religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I never lose hope. There must be some loophole, some way Tarik and Jess can date without causing her Grandma Pearl to go into a nursing home prematurely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica waves the crowd away. \"I\u0027m fine. Really.\" She\u0027s trying to convince them. It\u0027s not working. First of all, her mascara is running down her face like streaks of ash with tears leading the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push everyone else out of the way. Picking her chin up with my fingers, I say quietly, \"Jess, don\u0027t cry. I\u0027m sure once you explain the situation to your parents, it won\u0027t be such a big deal. You\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading me to the side, away from everyone else, she says, \"No, I won\u0027t. My mom\u0027s family was killed in the Holocaust, Amy. My great-grandfather has a number tattooed on his arm from when he was in a concentration camp. A reminder you can\u0027t wash away with soap and water. If I even mention a non-Jewish boy\u0027s name in his presence I feel guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still think God will take care of Jessica and look after her. I have complete faith. And there\u0027s always the guilt offering of a burnt animal...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess wipes her eyes, trying to compose herself. Grabbing paper towels and looking into the mirror, she witnesses the streaky mess her face is. \"Take a look at me, Amy,\" she says. \"I can\u0027t go out there looking like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to. Nathan\u0027s counting on us being here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew tears start streaming down her face and she turns to me. \"Tarik said he\u0027d be honored to go to the Valentine\u0027s Dance with me, Amy. Honored. When I spilled the beans about how I didn\u0027t have a date, he asked me. Right there in his car in front of my condo. And we had a moment. I know it sounds crazy and stupid, but we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment? Is she kidding me? A moment of lust, perhaps, but not love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. I know how much she wants to go to the Valentine\u0027s Dance. It\u0027s not about the dance. It\u0027s not about love. It\u0027s about being wanted and accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I could stop her from looking in the mirror again, but it\u0027s no use. One more wipe of the running mascara and I can see the defeat in her eyes. \"I\u0027m going home. Tell Nathan and Miranda I\u0027ll see them at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moves past me and out the door. I don\u0027t even try and stop her because I\u0027ve been best friends with Jessica long enough to know I can\u0027t convince her to stay. Besides, what more can I say? I can\u0027t tell her Tarik isn\u0027t awesome, because he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of awesome guys, I\u0027ve left mine alone enough tonight. Heading back to the big crowd, I scan the area and find Avi sitting at the table with Miranda. They\u0027re surrounded by a bunch of people, talking and laughing. Two girls who I\u0027ve never seen before are standing right near Avi. I can tell they\u0027re flirting by the way one is flipping her hair and the other girl is licking her lips. My protective radar goes off (okay, my jealousy radar goes off, too) and I weave through the mass of people with my chest held high, and steer toward my boyfriend like a paper clip to a magnet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hair-flipping girl is telling a story about her trip to Israel two summers ago and how she\u0027s dying to go back. It\u0027s hard to hear the details of her adventures because music is blaring in the background and I\u0027m stuck standing behind Miranda. There\u0027s no room next to my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lip-licker is laughing while lip-licking, which I think she\u0027s practiced in the mirror before. She does it frighteningly well. Avi is so intrigued with her conversation he doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m standing here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looks up at me. \"Maya is telling us about her trip to Israel,\" Miranda tells me. \"She went to Gadna for a week. It\u0027s a military training camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, great. Flippy-haired Maya can talk guns with my commando boyfriend. I\u0027m feeling sick and might just follow Jessica out the door so I can go home, too. \"I went to Israel, too,\" I blurt out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have nothing else to say. I didn\u0027t go to an Israeli military training camp and I don\u0027t have hair I can flip over my shoulder and make it look like I just got it styled at a salon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-29.html","bookId":2765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM"}
