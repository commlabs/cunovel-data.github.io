No one spoke. I couldn’t testify that any of us were even breathing. I had never heard silence so loud. A few moments passed. It could have been hours. Finally the phone rang again. Bobby waited until the third ring before answering. “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who the fuck do you—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby hung up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonsa winced and turned his back so no one could see his expression. I don’t think he and Bobby had rehearsed this part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby sank slowly into a chair. He gripped the arms tightly and lowered his head until his chin was touching his chest. “Oh God, oh God,” he muttered. “What have I done?” Shelby knelt next to the chair. She wrapped one arm around Bobby’s legs and lowered her head into his lap. Bobby released the chair and draped his arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll call back,” I said to no one in par tic u lar. Maybe I was talking to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course he will,” Honsa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEinstein once said that an hour spent holding a pretty girl’s hand at a party might seem like only a moment, while a moment spent touching a hot stove might seem like an hour—that’s relativity. For the next ten minutes, we were all sitting on a stove. It was very hot and it was very painful and I, for one, wondered how we got there and how we would get off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bobby answered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Victoria Dunston’s voice said, “Daddy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby lost it for the first time. “Oh, Vic, Vic,” he said, his voice choking on the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not afraid,” Victoria said. “I told them I’m not afraid. I told them that they’re the ones should be afraid when you come for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could hear the kidnapper wresting the phone from Victoria’s hand. “Yada yada, yada. Is McKenzie there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get ’im.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cuz we don’t want no fuckin’ irate father playin’ Superman for his kid, that’s why. You got ten minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonsa turned to the tech agent. “Anything?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We only have a general location. It looks like the Badlands again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonsa nodded, and the tech agent was quickly on his feet. “What should I do?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie,” Honsa said. “Do you have an onboard navigation system in your car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but I never use it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me your keys,” the tech agent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My keys?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed him my car keys and asked, “What’s going on?” as he hurried out the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The navigation system has a GPS component,” Honsa said. “If it’s sensitive enough, we can use it to track your whereabouts to within fifteen to twenty meters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My whereabouts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks like you’ll be delivering the ransom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll deliver the ransom,” Bobby declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard him on the phone. There’s a good possibility that the kidnapper won’t allow it,” Honsa told him. “He’s afraid of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He should be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t want him afraid, Lieutenant. We want him as calm as he can be. If he asks for McKenzie, we’re going to give him McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not our decision to make,” Honsa said. “It’s Thomforde’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew, too. This was Bobby’s job, Bobby’s place. He must have thought I was usurping his position in his own family. Only it wasn’t my idea. None of this was my idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right with me if you deliver the money,” I said. “You can use my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your car,” said Honsa. “That’s another thing. Your navigation system has a dashboard microphone that allows you to talk to your computer, that allows you to contact emergency personnel in case of an accident. It works like a cell phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to activate the microphone and reroute the signal to our own receivers so we can hear everything that’s said in the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk to us, McKenzie,” Harry said. “You won’t hear us, but we’ll hear you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my daughter,” Bobby repeated. “It’s my job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what to tell you, Lieutenant,” Honsa said. “Thomforde is calling the tune now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we’re all going to dance to it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Honsa nodded his head emphatically. “Yes, we are. Until it’s time for us to call the tune. Then we’ll make him dance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, the tech agent returned. He was carrying a softsided toolbox. “The car’s ready,” he said. He hefted the box onto the dining room table. He was looking at Honsa when he asked, “Who gets it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonsa was staring directly into Bobby’s eyes when he said, “McKenzie,” and then, “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take off your shirt,” the tech agent told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/madman-on-a-drum-mac-mckenzie-5/page-43.html","bookId":2221,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:11 PM"}
