Though she was aware of something being placed over her head, she felt her soul slipping away. She made one last plea to God, one last prayer as atonement, one final request of the Holy Mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHail Mary, full of grace . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash pushed the speed limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip to Molalla had been a bust, Nash thought as she drove up the familiar road to Mercy Hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash and Double T had been given the same warm welcome as Sparks and Carter had earlier. They, too, had been left to stand on the front porch of a small house, a broken-down screen door between them and Sonja Watkins while she avoided questions and smoked three cigarettes. She’d been nervous as hell and hadn’t divulged where her aunt could be found, but Nash would bet her badge and a year’s salary that the woman had been lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash couldn’t help feeling she was spinning her wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had spent all day going over the autopsy reports on Holly Dennison and now, due to the rush that was put on it, Brandi Potts. She’d read the interviews of friends and family, witnesses and anyone close to the victims. She’d called with follow-up questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she’d come up with a big, fat zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo big insurance payouts upon either woman’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Potts’s case, no other woman lay waiting in the wings for her boyfriend to become single, at least none that Nash, nor Jenkins had yet rooted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo enemies with deep grudges against the women had emerged. So far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo gun-toting ex-lovers had been discovered lurking in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing about this case had been easy or normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least so far. Sometimes the other women, monetary gain, ex-boyfriends, or psychotic enemies weren’t initially noticed, but eventually floated to the surface like the scum they were. So far, nary a ripple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash slowed for an S curve, then gunned her little car as she rounded the final corner. She felt the “usual suspects” didn’t apply in this case. She kept coming back to the only connection she could find between the two victims which was, of course, Dead Heat, and therefore it seemed, Allie Kramer’s disappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat bothered her about it, was that it was almost too obvious. The masks. Really? It was as if the police were being given a road map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie Kramer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe Allie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one hand, Nash drummed her fingers on the steering wheel. Who bore the Sisters Kramer and their mother such ill will? For a moment her mind sauntered down the jagged pathway leading to their father and his new family, but she did a quick U-turn. Robert Kramer was too self-serving. Yeah, out for himself, but not a killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo who was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the question,” she said as she turned through the gates of the hospital and the white edifice flanked by lush gardens came into view. Despite the marble and brick facade and the huge columns, the hospital appeared austere and cold, almost foreboding, but then she’d had an aversion to any kind of medical buildings since losing her daughter. Refusing to let her mind wander down that painful path, she pulled into a parking space in the designated area, cut the engine, and with an eye to the gray skies, hurried toward the main entrance of Mercy Hospital. Her heels clicked loudly on the smooth floor of the grand reception area where she was met with all the warmth of an iceberg by the receptionist, who, after demanding to see Nash’s badge, finally released the packet that was supposed to hold Belva Nelson’s employment records. Nash opened the envelope in the reception area, just to make certain it was the information she needed and after confirming that copies of the records were enclosed, stuffed the packet into her case and left the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung by her house, grabbed a change of clothes and headed back to the office. A quick check on her dash told her it was after five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean Arnette’s party for the cast and crew was scheduled for seven and though, of course, she hadn’t been sent an invitation, she thought she’d wander over to the Hotel Danvers, have a drink in the bar and see if she could find a way inside the ballroom where the event, a private party, was to be held. Of course the press had been invited. Since the manager was a friend of a friend, the department had come to the hotel’s aid on more than one occasion and Nash hoped to see some of the players in the drama that was her case. Especially the elusive and slippery Brandon McNary. For some reason Dead Heat’s bad-boy star seemed to be steadfastly avoiding her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-152.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
