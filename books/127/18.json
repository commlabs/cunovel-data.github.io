Memorize\u0026nbsp; that! We are part of\u0026nbsp; the Emperor\u0027s personal domain, andno one touches us.

The Empire isalways shot through with a certain amount of politics and with differentmen pulling this way and that. Governors have rebelled, and, for thatmatter, Emperors have been deposed, or assassinated before this. But whathas that to do with the Empire itself? Forget it, Hardin. It\u0027s none of ourbusiness.
