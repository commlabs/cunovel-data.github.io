I was in my bedroom mixing potions, watching how the dyes curl in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0027t sound like much, I know. But I\u0027d spilled a few cup full’s onto the carpet. My fingers were stained purple. It was enough to give the Old Man an excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came in so quietly I didn\u0027t hear him, didn\u0027t know he was standing over me until I caught his smell, like sweet smoked beef.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said something like, \"Is this what we clean the house for? We clean the house so you can do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I realized water was running in the bathroom. I remembered what my friend had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to apologize, but the Old Man caught my wrists, dragged me backward, using my arms as a harness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kicked at the carpet and walls as he pulled me down the hallway. When we passed the bathroom doorjamb, I got one hand loose and grabbed at it, but the Old Man just yanked harder, ripping a nail off my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling sparkled white. I remember bare avocado rings on the shower rod, plastic starrivets holding up the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Old Man lifted me, squeezed me against his chest. I was clawing, grabbing at his clothes. Then he dumped me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold stopped my blood. I floated, wet to my armpits, my clothes grafted to my chest, heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew better than to try standing. I lay low, crying, the water nipping the backs of my ears. My mouth tasted salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a comma of blood from my ripped nail on the Old Man\u0027s shirt pocket, purple smudges from my dyed fingers on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"What did you do wrong? Tell me what you were doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice sounded kindly in the tiled acoustics of the bathroom, rich and deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t answer. I cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to hear that,\" he scolded.\"Until you can tell me what you did, I don\u0027t want any sound from you \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept crying—knowing it was the wrong thing to do, but crying more because of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he leaned over me, pushed my chest, and the water closed over my head. Sound turned to aluminium. I could hear my own struggling and splashing. Water lapped into the overflow drain, rushed through pipes in the walls like underground machinery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Old Man shimmered above me, his hand keeping a warm, constant clamp on the middle of my chest. I clawed at his wrist, but it might as well have been a mesquite branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my breath, which is hard when you\u0027re facing up, the water flooding your nostrils, gagging you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to be still. I thought maybe if I were still, the Old Man would let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied the hazy balls of light above the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lungs burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally—the first clear decision I ever remember making—I gave up. I breathed in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, as if he knew, the bastard lifted me out, rolled me onto the tiled floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curled, cold and trembling, belching water, my throat on fire. \"Be grateful,\" he said.\"Be grateful for what you have.\" That was only the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, he taught me that drowning a thing you hate— drowning it well and drowning it completely—is a slow process. It is an art only the patient can master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I learned to be patient. I\u0027ll always credit the Old Man for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars Elder looks like a banker the way I look like a private eye, which is to say, not much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was waiting on the porch of my family ranch house, flicking a switchblade open and closed, a computer disk and a can of Budweiser next to him on the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars\u0027 hairline had receded since I\u0027d seen him last, but he still sported the earring, the Willie Nelson beard. His shirt, vest, and jeans were faded to the colours of a dust storm, and his eyes gave the same impression—dry and turbulent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tres,\" he said. \"Thanks for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problema.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I was thinking: The Navarre family banker drinking beer at ten in the morning is not a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars closed his knife, looked out toward the wheat fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty yards away, past the tomato garden, the ranch caretaker was putting hay into the cattle feeder. Harold Diliberto stopped to watch us, his pitchfork suspended, dripping straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harold showed me the work you\u0027ve been doing inside,\" Lars said. \"You\u0027ve been spending a lot of time out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to feel irritated, like Harold had betrayed a confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth was, I\u0027d been out at the ranch every weekend since the end of April—scraping old paint, filling in the spreading cracks in the original section of the house that had been my greatgrandfather\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehomestead in the 1880s. I\u0027d neglected both my jobs in San Antonio, ditched the cell phone, dropped out of my social life with little explanation to my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Place was overdue for some maintenance,\" I told Lars. \"You ask me out here for the Home Beautiful tour? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t smile. \"Talked to Garrett recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe four, five months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ll see him soon. You\u0027re teaching that summer class in Austin, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother surge of irritation. \"British lit, for six weeks. May I ask how the hell you know about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars brought the switchblade up like a conductor\u0027s baton. \"Look, I\u0027m sorry. I had to talk to you before you left. You know what Garrett\u0027s been up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean like Buffett concerts? Smoking pot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His programming project.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must\u0027ve missed it. I tend to phase out when Garrett talks about RNI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars winced, like I\u0027d just told him the price of an expensive gift. \"Tres, Garrett isn\u0027t working at RNI anymore. He quit over a year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. My brother had worked at the same software company for sixteen years. He practically ran the place, took all the days off he wanted, had a retirement package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got himself involved in a startup company,\" Lars told me. \"That was two years ago—spring of \u002798. Then last year, May of \u002799, he decided he couldn\u0027t keep working both jobs anymore. Garrett just left RNI—no severance, no benefits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s working the startup with Jimmy Doebler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied Lars\u0027 eyes, tried to tell if he was joking. Apparently, he wasn\u0027t, and beer for breakfast started sounding like a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast I\u0027d heard—maybe three years ago—Jimmy Doebler and Garrett hadn\u0027t even been speaking to each other. When they were speaking, they got along about as well as electricity and gunpowder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars picked up the computer disk, handed it to me. \"Some files—things I was able to find on the Internet. They\u0027re calling themselves Techsan Security Software. Three principals in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompany—Jimmy, his wife Ruby, and Garrett. They\u0027ve been designing an encryption product. The betatesting started in January.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wagged the floppy. \"It\u0027s news to me. Why the dossier, Lars? What\u0027s your interest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his beard with his knuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known Jimmy and Garrett for a long time. I was around when Garrett—\" He faltered. \"Well, you know. I was around for the bad times. But when I called Garrett last week, I\u0027d never heard him sound so bad. He and Jimmy are fighting again. Jimmy and his wife have separated—all because of this company they\u0027ve started. I asked Garrett how they were holding up financially. He just laughed. The last few days, he won\u0027t even return my calls. I thought maybe you could talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over the split rail fence, down the pasture toward the woods. The Charolais were grazing in the dry bed of Apache Creek. The water tower glistened gray. *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the hundreds of times I\u0027d watched the sun come up over the Balcones Escarpment from here, the topography like an onion, layer upon translucent layer—my first hunting trip with my dad, a dozen Thanksgiving dinners, my first night with a woman, three hurricanes, two fires, even a snowstorm. I remembered my grandfather, over there by the northern property line, digging holes for fence posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even after six weeks of manual labour, rebuilding my relationship with the ranch, I could still feel that Sunday afternoon last April, down in the clearing, when I\u0027d almost died at the hands of an old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I wanted was a few more weekends, time to scrape paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Lars, I won\u0027t say I\u0027m not worried. But Garrett and Jimmy—what you\u0027re describing. Unfortunately, it sounds pretty typical. I appreciate your concern ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" Lars said. \"Garrett needed capital for his share in the Techsan startup. A lot of capital. With his financial record, nobody else would help him. I hate even talking to you about this, Tres. I know you don\u0027t have a lot of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to hand back the computer disk. \"If you made my brother a loan, I\u0027m sorry, Lars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t see how I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t talk him out of it,\" he said. \"The deed is in his name. He made me promise not to worry you, but when he signed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe papers he still had a steady job. Now . . . He hasn\u0027t made a payment in over a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just—I don\u0027t know what I can promise, come July first. My boss is breathing down my neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart twisted into a sailor\u0027s knot. \"July first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars pinched the blade of his knife, threw it toward an old live oak stump, where it stuck straight up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garrett mortgaged this ranch, Tres. And Unless I see something—a sign of good faith by the end of this month, I\u0027m going to have to foreclose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSan Antonio and Austin are like estranged siblings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSan Antonio would be the sister who stayed home, took care of the elderly parents, made tortillas by hand in the kitchen, wore cotton dresses until the colours faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s the bigboned one— handsome but unadorned, given to long afternoon siestas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAustin is the sister who went away to college, discovered rock \u0027n\u0027 roll, and dyed her hair purple. She\u0027s the one my mother would\u0027ve warned me about, if my mother hadn\u0027t been an exhippie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon I figured out why God put the two sisters seventy five miles apart. It was to give irate siblings like me a coolingoff period—an hour on the road to reconsider fratricide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround two o\u0027clock, I finally tracked down my brother. A friend of a Hell\u0027s Angel of a friend told me he was staying at Jimmy Doebler\u0027s place on Lake Travis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, they were down by the water, building something that looked like the third little pig\u0027s house. It was a kiln— pottery being Jimmy\u0027s second oldest hobby, next to getting Garrett in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom fifteen feet away, Jimmy and Garrett hadn\u0027t noticed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy was hunched over, tapping down a line of bricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett was up on a scaffold, five feet above, doing the chimney. His ponytail had flipped over the shoulder and gotten stuck in a splot of wet mortar. Sweat glistened in his beard. He made an odd sight up there, with no legs, like some sort of tiedyed polyp grown out of the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe afternoon heat was cooking the air into soup. In the crook of a smoke tree, a jam box was cranking out Lucinda Williams\u0027 latest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-1.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
