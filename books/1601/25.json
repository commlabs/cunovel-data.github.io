I don’t have more for you yet; I only just received this note. Queen Elayne was awakened by some of her advisors a short time ago. I don’t have anyone close enough to know why\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand frowned, resting his hand on Laman’s sword at his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could just be plans for tomorrow\", Perrin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True\", Rand said. \"Let me know if you discover anything, Balwer. Thank you. You do well here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stood taller. In these last days—days so dark—every man looked for something useful to do. Balwer was the best at what he did, and was confident in his own abilities. Still, it did no harm to be reminded of the fact by one who employed him, particularly if his employer was none other than the Dragon Reborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand left the tent, Perrin following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re worried about it\", Perrin said. \"Whatever it was that awoke Elayne\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They would not awaken her without good cause\", Rand said softly. \"Considering her state\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePregnant. Pregnant with his children. Light! He had only just learned of it. Why hadn’t she been the one to tell him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was simple. Elayne could feel Rand’s emotions as he felt hers. She would have been able to feel how he had been, recently. Before Dragonmount. Back when . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she wouldn’t have wanted to confront him with a pregnancy when he’d been in such a state. Beyond that, he hadn’t exactly made himself easy to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it was a shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to be a father, he thought, not for the first time. Yes, Lews Therin had had children, could remember them and his love for them. It wasn’t the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, Rand al’Thor, would be a father. Assuming he won the Last Battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn’t have awakened Elayne without good reason\", he continued, returning to task. \"I’m worried, not because of what might have happened, but because of the potential distraction. Tomorrow will be an important day. If the Shadow has any inkling of tomorrow’s importance, it will try whatever it can to keep us from meeting, from unifying\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin scratched at his beard. \"I have people close to Elayne. People who keep watch on things for me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand raised his hand. \"Let’s go talk to them. I have a great deal to do tonight, but . . . Yes, I can’t let this slip\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two turned toward Perrin’s camp nearby, picking up their pace, Rand’s bodyguards following like shadows with veils and spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night felt too quiet. Egwene, in her tent, worked on a letter to Rand. She was not certain if she would send it. Sending it was not important. Writing it was about organizing her thoughts, determining what she wished to say to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn pushed his way into the tent again, hand on his sword, Warder cloak rustling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to stay in this time?\" Egwene asked, dipping her pen, \"or are you going to go right back out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t like this night, Egwene\". He looked over his shoulder. \"Something feels wrong about it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The world holds its breath, Gawyn, waiting upon the events of the morrow. Did you send to Elayne, as I requested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. She won’t be awake. It’s too late for her\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t long before a messenger arrived from Elayne’s camp, bearing a small folded letter. Egwene read it, then smiled. \"Come\", she said to Gawyn, rising and gathering a few things. She waved a hand, and a gateway split the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’re Traveling there?\" Gawyn asked. \"It’s only a short walk\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A short walk would require the Amyrlin to call upon the Queen of Andor\", Egwene said as Gawyn stepped through the gateway first and checked the other side. \"Sometimes, I don’t want to take an action that starts people asking questions\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiuan would have killed for this ability, Egwene thought as she stepped through the gateway. How many more plots could that woman have spun if she’d been able to visit others as quickly, quietly and easily as this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, Elayne stood beside a warm brazier. The Queen wore a pale green dress, her belly swollen from the babes within. She hastened over to Egwene and kissed her ring. Birgitte stood to one side of the tent flaps, arms folded, wearing her short red jacket and wide, sky-blue trousers, her golden braid down over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn cocked an eyebrow at his sister. \"I\u0027m surprised you are awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m waiting for a report\", Elayne said, gesturing for Egwene to join her in a pair of cushioned chairs beside the brazier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something important?\" Egwene asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne fawned. \"Jesamyn forgot to check in again from Caemlyn. I left the woman strict orders to send to me every two hours, and yet she dallies. Light, its probably nothing. Still, I asked Serinia to go to the Traveling grounds to check on things for me. I hope you don’t mind\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need rest\", Gawyn said, folding his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you very much for the advice\", Elayne said, \"which I will ignore, as I ignored Birgitte when she said the same thing. Mother, what is it you wished to discuss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene handed over the letter she had been working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Rand?\" Elayne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a different perspective on him than I. Tell me what you think of this letter. I might not send it to him. I haven’t decided yet\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tone is . . . forceful\", Elayne noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn’t seem to respond to anything else\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment of reading Elayne lowered the letter. \"Perhaps we should simply let him do as he wishes\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Break the seals?\" Egwene asked. \"Release the Dark One?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light, Elayne!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to happen, doesn’t it?\" Elayne asked. \"I mean, the Dark One’s going to escape. He’s practically free already\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene rubbed her temples. \"There is a difference between touching the world and being free. During the War of Power, the Dark One was never truly released into the world. The Bore let him touch it, but that was resealed before he could escape. If the Dark One had entered the world, the Wheel itself would have been broken.
