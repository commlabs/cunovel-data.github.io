When it becomes clear that I\u0027ve got nothing else to say she fills the silence by murmuring, \"I just want to finish this thing,\" and since I don\u0027t know what thing she\u0027s really talking about I start to babble. \"Baby, why are you even doing this? I thought it was strictly features for Chloe Byrnes. You turned down that MTV thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t want me to do that MTV thing, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but only when I found out what your per diem was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You said no when you found out that you didn\u0027t have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might as well face it,\" I say. \"You\u0027re addicted to love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chloe,\" Taylor calls from the egg. \"We\u0027re ready.

From my third-floor vantage the club hasn\u0027t been this bustling since its inception and tables are being set by handpicked busboys who just skateboarded in, waiters brandishing glasses and tablecloths and candles also set chairs around the tables and the carpets are being vacuumed by guys with shag haircuts and a couple of waitresses who arrived early are being photographed by shadowy clumps of people while dancers rehearse amid technicians and security teams and guest-list people and three gorgeous coat-check girls chew gum and flaunt their midriffs and pierced belly buttons and bars are being stocked and giant flower displays are in the process of being strategically lit and Matthew Sweet\u0027s \"We\u0027re the Same\" is blaring and the metal detectors sit in place at the entrance waiting to be entered and I\u0027m taking it all in blankly, considering fleetingly what it all means and also that being semi-famous is in itself difficult but since it\u0027s so cold in the club it\u0027s hard to stay still so I rush up two flights to the offices more relieved than I should be that everything\u0027s finally falling into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where was Beau?
