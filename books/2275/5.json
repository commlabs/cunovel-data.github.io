After her sessions with the doctor, she had learned to keep quiet. Nor did she ever explain why it seemed that sometimes she had more than intuition. She’d always had a good grip on the world—in many ways there were very thin lines between the truth and insanity. People’s perception of the truth was often the difference between leading a normal and productive life—and having someone lock you up for your own welfare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam Harrison seemed to be different, as had many of the officers she had worked with at the police force in Virginia. She had become known for her use of logic, careful study of a crime scene and the victim, and the possible personality of the perpetrator or perpetrators. Police officers tended to believe in intuition; good detectives always seemed to rely upon gut instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, she had almost been frightened of herself. But she had to tamp down the fear; good could come when she allowed the thoughts and “instincts” to run through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake the Abernathy case. The one in which she had really made a difference. The baby had been kidnapped by kids just wanting to make money. Two teens, seventeen and sixteen. They’d easily managed to steal the baby from the babysitter. But they’d buried the little boy, and if she hadn’t come to the house, if she hadn’t added it all up—no break-in, no signs of disturbance, no prints or even smudges on the windowsill—and felt certain that the child was close, they might never have found the baby, buried in the crate right in the backyard. She would never forget the joy in the mother’s face when they had dug up that baby, and she had heard her awaken at last and cry….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had entered the mind of the Virginia Stalker, and found the remains of Valerie Abreu, allowing the courts the evidence to put the man away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were battles, of course, that she couldn’t win. Life was full of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had lost her parents. And she had lost Griffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriffin, her fiancé, had died in her arms, with his mother softly sobbing at his side. Cancer was as cruel as any enemy she could ever face and she had been helpless against the disease. Griffin, who had seemed to understand her and love her for all that she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Griffin had found peace, and Griffin had loved her. He told her that she had a special gift, and that she should always use it to the best of her ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she had a gift. And now she had knowledge and experience. The police academy had saved her and she’d served with the force as an officer just before the call had come from her superiors, informing her that she’d been asked to meet with a “Federal” man named Adam Harrison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to her time with the police, she now dared to take chances she might not have before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up, determined to know, now, while she was in the house alone, why the area was driving her so crazy, making her feel so uncomfortable. Some of the houses in the French Quarter actually had basements, she remembered. Getting a better sense of the physical place would definitely be the logical move to make now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe French Quarter was barely above sea level, but it was “high ground” for the area. The basement was only halfway below the ground, and its roof was the floor where she stood now. She still needed to spend time studying the original blueprints of the house first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she felt a draw she couldn’t withstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela walked toward the door and turned the handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, and darkness stretched before her. The basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy Devereaux appeared to be easy and low-key, something that probably served him well when interrogating suspects. His voice lulled. He was soft-spoken. Everything about him seemed easy—except that he had the sharpest gaze known to man. And like a lazy-looking, tail-twitching great cat, he could move in the blink of an eye. The uniformed officers at the station seemed to like and respect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson stayed at the station long enough to meet some of the district personnel with whom he might come in contact when exploring all angles of the Holloway case, and then Andy drove him back to the house on Dauphine. Jackson realized that he was lucky; Devereaux seemed to like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy loved the city of New Orleans, and he loved being a cop. He wanted Jackson to understand the city, and the police force. “This department is a damn good one, and believe me, it’s had its ups and downs, and we still go through some hell now and then—God knows, things that test a man’s patience to the core. Katrina, the oil spill—we just get on our feet again and get knocked down, so you’ve got destruction, desperation and poverty, and all of them clashing together. Some folks love the city, some folks just sweep down to make a living on the misfortunes of others. We had a force down here early on, early 1800s, and then just like now, some years were good, the city was organized and reorganized—the French Quarter, Vieux Carré, that’s the original city—but the Marigny came in on it early, just like the area we call the CBD now, Central Business District. And the Americans came in to form the Garden District—or the ‘English’ area. Anyway, they get a police force going, but along came the Civil War. By 1862, the Union had taken over and you have military rule. Then, the war ends, and carpetbaggers sweep down. Lincoln is dead, and Johnson isn’t really sure he wants black men to be equal with white men, but the ball is rolling. For years, that ball bounces up and down, equality—kill the upstart Africans—equality, no not really, just don’t own the man.” He glanced sideways at Jackson. “I don’t have any chips on my shoulder. History is history,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amen,” Jackson told him. “Remember when we were talking earlier and you asked me if I believed that a ghost had pushed Regina Holloway over the balcony? Well, I said no, and I meant it. But I think that people can play on the emotions of others with the power of suggestion, and the history of the house is tremendously important in that respect. And the history of the New Orleans police force fits right in there, because everything written about Madden C. Newton suggests that he managed to get away with all those murders because the city was in such a knot—emotionally, socially and governmentally—when he was committing the killings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy nodded and pulled the car to a stop on the side of Dauphine in front of the house. “Best hamburgers in the world about three blocks from here on Esplanade,” he said. “A place called Port of Call. Seriously, best burgers anywhere, and best potatoes, go figure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks again,” Jackson said, exiting the unmarked police car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows had settled around the house. Though it was in excellent shape, it carried a poignant hint of the decaying elegance that made up so much of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked up the steps to the porch—Angela Hawkins should have arrived by now. He unlocked the front door, calling out, “Hello,” as he did so, not wanting to startle anyone with his presence. He stepped into the grand ballroom or parlor. The great chandelier was lit, casting a haunting glow over the sheet-draped furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was here; a big shoulder bag and a carry-on suitcase sat by the door. She traveled like a cop, he noted. Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss Hawkins?” he said, his voice loud and strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, there was no answer. Of course, the place was huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went up the stairs first, following the horseshoe, thinking she might be choosing a bedroom for the stay. But she wasn’t upstairs, so he came down to the kitchen. “Miss Hawkins?” he said again. She wasn’t there either, but she’d left a book on the table; an old one. He looked at the title. Madden C. Newton:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe True Story of New Orleans’s Own Jekyll and Hyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leafed through it. Interesting, and surely, almost impossible to acquire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtyard caught his eye, and he looked out, for a moment dreading the possibility that he might see a body smashed and broken on the ground. But there was no one outside—no bodies lay on the bricks. “Miss Hawkins?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, he heard a whack. The sound was hard. Like an ax hitting wood, or…a pickax slamming into hard ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried to the nearest door and threw it open, once again, strange and deadly visions coming to his mind despite his perpetual search for rationality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found the ghost of the ultimate evil in man. Madden C. Newton. And the ghost had taken form and shape, and was hacking up the elusive Miss Hawkins…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhack, whack, whack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss Hawkins!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWooden stairs led down to a shallow basement. Someone indeed had a pickax, and looked as crazy as all hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela Hawkins was attacking the floor with a pickax and a vengeance. The dry dirt floor just beneath the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell are you doing?” He might have been a fool to race down the stairs to accost her—she knew how to hold an ax. The basement held an incongruous sight. Angela was about five foot eight and slender, though shapely. Despite her height, she was almost fragile in appearance. She paused for a moment, staring at him with enormous, bright blue eyes that belonged on an anime character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, great! He was being given the nut-job assignment. He should have said no. He should have just resigned, and headed off to work the casinos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela remained frozen for a second longer, obviously a bit disconcerted by being discovered at her task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um—hi! I’m Angela Hawkins. You must be Jackson Crow.” Maintaining a grip on the pickax with her left hand, she offered her right in a strong handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, hi, nice to meet you.” The words seemed a bit ridiculous. At least she wasn’t swinging the ax at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped he betrayed nothing in his expression. Did she know about him? That he had taken down the Pick-Man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a test?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried not to sound as hard and angry as he felt when he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Jackson Crow. And—sorry, excuse me, but what are you doing?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-evil-krewe-of-hunters-1/page-5.html","bookId":2275,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:41 PM"}
