It was not tied with a tape across the eye, but screwed in like a monocle. Otherwise he seemed a friendly middle-aged man, with dark brown hair brushed straight back, and, as Bond had seen while he was talking to the patron, particularly large, white teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to Vesper. \u0027Really, darling. He looks very innocent. Are you sure he\u0027s the same man? We can\u0027t expect to have this place entirely to ourselves.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVesper\u0027s face was still a white mask. She was clutching the edge of the table with both hands. He thought she was going to faint and almost rose to come round to her, but she made a gesture to stop him. Then she reached for a glass of wine and took a deep draught. The glass rattled on her teeth and she brought up her other hand to help. Then she put the glass down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him with dull eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know it\u0027s the same.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to reason with her, but she paid no attention. After glancing once or twice over his shoulder with eyes that held a curious submissiveness, she said that her headache was still bad and that she would spend the afternoon in her room. She left the table and walked indoors without a backward glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond was determined to set her mind at rest. He ordered coffee to be brought to the table and then he rose and walked swiftly to the courtyard. The black Peugeot which stood there might indeed have been the saloon they had seen, but it might equally have been one of a million others on the French roads. He took a quick glance inside, but the interior was empty and when he tried the boot, it was locked. He made a note of the Paris number-plate then he went quickly to the lavatory adjoining the dining-room, pulled the chain and walked out on to the terrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was eating and didn\u0027t look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond sat down in Vesper\u0027s chair so that he could watch the other table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later the man asked for the bill, paid it and left. Bond heard the Peugeot start up and soon the noise of its exhaust had disappeared in the direction of the road to Royale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the patron came back to his table, Bond explained that Madame had unfortunately a slight touch of sunstroke. After the patron had expressed his regret and enlarged on the dangers of going out of doors in almost any weather, Bond casually asked about the other customer. \u0027He reminds me of a friend who also lost an eye. They wear similar black patches.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patron answered that the man was a stranger. He had been pleased with his lunch and had said that he would be passing that way again in a day or two and would take another meal at the auberge. Apparently he was Swiss, which could also be seen from his accent. He was a traveller in watches. It was shocking to have only one eye. The strain of keeping that patch in place all day long. He supposed one got used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It is indeed very sad,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027You also have been unlucky,\u0027 he gestured to the proprietor\u0027s empty sleeve. \u0027I myself was very fortunate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a time they talked about the war. Then Bond rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027By the way,\u0027 he said, \u0027Madame had an early telephone call which I must remember to pay for. Paris. An Elysâ€še number I think,\u0027 he added, remembering that that was Mathis\u0027s exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you, monsieur, but the matter is regulated. I was speaking to Royale this morning and the exchange mentioned that one of my guests had put through a call to Paris and that there had been no answer. They wanted to know if Madame would like the call kept in. I\u0027m afraid the matter escaped my mind. Perhaps Monsieur would mention it to Madame. But, let me see, it was an Invalides number the exchange referred to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26 - \u0027SLEEP WELL, MY DARLING\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next two days were much the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the fourth day of their stay Vesper went off early to Royale. A taxi came and fetched her and brought her back. She said she needed some medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night she made a special effort to be gay. She drank a lot and when they went upstairs, she led him into her bedroom and made passionate love to him. Bond\u0027s body responded, but afterwards she cried bitterly into her pillow and Bond went to his room in grim despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hardly sleep and in the early hours he heard her door open softly. Some small sounds came from downstairs. He was sure she was in the telephone booth. Very soon he beard her door softly close and he guessed that again there had been no reply from Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sunday the man with the black patch was back again. Bond knew it directly he looked up from his lunch and saw her face. He had told her all that the patron had told him, withholding only the man\u0027s statement that he might be back. He had thought it would worry her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had also telephoned Mathis in Paris and checked on the Peugeot. It had been hired from a respectable firm two weeks before. The customer had had a Swiss triptyque. His name was Adolph Gettler. He had given a bank in Zurich as his address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMathis had got on to the Swiss police. Yes, the bank had an account in this name. It was little used. Herr Gettler was understood to be connected with the watch industry. Inquiries could be pursued if there was a charge against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVesper had shrugged her shoulders at the information. This time when the man appeared she left her lunch in the middle and went straight up to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond made up his mind. When he had finished, he followed her. Both her doors were locked and when he made her let him in, he saw that she had been sitting in the shadows by the window, watching, he presumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was of cold stone. He led her to the bed and drew her down beside him. They sat stiffly, like people in a railway carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Vesper,\u0027 he said, holding her cold hands in his, \u0027we can\u0027t go on like this. We must finish with it. We are torturing each other and there is only one way of stopping it. Either you must tell me what all this is about or we must leave. At once.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing and her hands were lifeless in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My darling,\u0027 he said. \u0027Won\u0027t you tell me? Do you know, that first morning I was coming back to ask you to marry me. Can\u0027t we go back to the beginning again? What is this dreadful nightmare that is killing us?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she said nothing, then a tear rolled slowly down her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You mean you would have married me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh my God,\u0027 she said. \u0027My God.\u0027 She turned and clutched him, pressing her face against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her closely to him. \u0027Tell me, my love,\u0027 he said. \u0027Tell me what\u0027s hurting you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sobs became quieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Leave me for a little,\u0027 she said and a new note had come into her voice. A note of resignation. \u0027Let me think for a little.\u0027 She kissed his face and held it between her hands. She looked at him with yearning. \u0027Darling, I\u0027m trying to do what\u0027s best for us. Please believe me. But it\u0027s terrible. I\u0027m in a frightful . . .\u0027 She wept again, clutching him like a child with nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe soothed her, stroking the long black hair and kissing her softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go away now,\u0027 she said. \u0027I must have time to think. We\u0027ve got to do something.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took his handkerchief and dried her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led him to the door and there they held tightly to each other. Then he kissed her again and she shut the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening most of the gayness and intimacy of their first night came back. She was excited and some of her laughter sounded brittle, but Bond was determined to fall in with her new mood and it was only at the end of dinner that he made a passing remark which made her pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand over his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t talk about it now,\u0027 she said. \u0027Forget it now. It\u0027s all past. I\u0027ll tell you about it in the morning.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and suddenly her eyes were full of tears. She found a handkerchief in her bag and dabbed at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Give me some more champagne,\u0027 she said. She gave a queer little laugh. \u0027I want a lot more. You drink much more than me. It\u0027s not fair.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat and drank together until the bottle was finished. Then she got to her feet. She knocked against her chair and giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I do believe I\u0027m tight,\u0027 she said, \u0027how disgraceful. Please, James, don\u0027t be ashamed of me. I did so want to be gay. And I am gay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood behind him and ran her fingers through his black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come up quickly,\u0027 she said. \u0027I want you badly tonight.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blew a kiss at him and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor two hours they made slow, sweet love in a mood of happy passion which the day before Bond would never have thought they could regain. The barriers of self-consciousness and mistrust seemed to have vanished and the words they spoke to each other were innocent and true again and there was no shadow between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You must go now,\u0027 said Vesper when Bond had slept for a while in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to take back her words she held him more closely to her, murmuring endearments and pressing her body down the whole length of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finally rose and bent to smooth back her hair and finally kiss her eyes and her mouth good night, she reached out and turned on the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look at me,\u0027 she said, \u0027and let me look at you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe examined every line on his face as if she was seeing him for the first time. Then she reached up and put an arm round his neck. Her deep blue eyes were swimming with tears as she drew his head slowly towards her and kissed him gently on the lips. Then she let him go and turned off the light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good night, my dearest love,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond bent and kissed her. He tasted the tears on her heck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to the door and looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sleep well, my darling,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, everything\u0027s all right now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the door softly and walked to his room with a full heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 27 - THE BLEEDING HEART\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patron brought him the letter in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe burst into Bond\u0027s room holding the envelope in front of him as if it was on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There has been a terrible accident. Madame . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond hurled himself out of bed and through the bathroom, but the communicating door was locked. He dashed back and through his room and down the corridor past a shrinking, terrified maid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVesper\u0027s door was open. The sunlight through the shutters lit up the room. Only her black hair showed above the sheet and her body under the bedclothes was straight and moulded like a stone effigy on a tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond fell on his knees beside her and drew back the sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was asleep. She must be. Her eyes were closed. There was no change in the dear face. She was just as she would look and yet, and yet she was so still, no movement, no pulse, no breath. That was it. There was no breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater the patron came and touched him on the shoulder. He pointed at the empty glass on the table beside her. There were white dregs in the bottom of it. It stood beside her book and her cigarettes and matches and the small pathetic litter of her mirror and lipstick and handkerchief. And on the floor the empty bottle of sleeping-pills, the pills Bond had seen in the bathroom that first evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond rose to his feet and shook himself. The patron was holding out the letter towards him. He took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Please notify the Commissaire,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I will be in my room when he wants me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked blindly away without a backward glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the edge of his bed and gazed out of the window at the peaceful sea. Then he stared dully at the envelope. It was addressed simply in a large round hand \u0027Pour Lui\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought passed through Bond\u0027s mind that she must have left orders to be called early, so that it would not be he who found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned the envelope over. Not long ago it was her warm tongue which had sealed the flap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a sudden shrug and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not long. After the first few words he read it quickly, the breath coming harshly through his nostrils. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-22.html","bookId":2424,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:43 PM"}
