{"id":86656,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"W-w-what do you mean?\" she asks nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s on the trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? How? Where has he been? Is he okay?\" she asks, panic laced in her voice. \"Okay, that\u0027s so weird. I really called you because I wanted to talk about Caleb and I didn\u0027t know who else to call besides you. How did you end up on the same trip as my brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how it happened, exactly. I think he\u0027s been living in Chicago since he left town. He\u0027s changed, though. He\u0027s not the same.\" I don\u0027t tell her my goal is to get Caleb back to Paradise to work things out. Leah needs him. His family needs him. I thought I needed him, but now we\u0027re too different. I can\u0027t be emotionally involved with someone who resents the world and wants to push everyone away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear hesitation in Leah\u0027s voice as she says, \"I always used to think an ESP thing between twins was something people made up. But I couldn\u0027t sleep the past few nights, Maggie. I swear Caleb is in trouble, or really unhappy. I feel his pain as if it\u0027s my own. That\u0027s stupid, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not stupid,\" I tell her. I believe anything is possible. It\u0027s probably because I\u0027m an over-emotional person. It\u0027s one of my flaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do me a favor, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of him, Maggie. Promise me you\u0027ll watch out for my brother,\" she says almost desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch out for him? Caleb is strong enough, if not emotionally than definitely physically, to take care of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Leah,\" I tell her. I swallow a lump in my throat and temporarily push away my newfound resolve to let go of Caleb once and for all. \"I\u0027ll make sure he stays out of trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou\u0027re a great dancer,\" Brandi says as we walk outside after we unload a beer bong in the kitchen. This girl is no stranger to beer bongs, I\u0027ll tell you that much. She\u0027s a damn pro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mumble, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe holds on to my elbow to steady herself and looks up at me with big brown eyes. \"You know what they say about good dancers, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure I know, but I want to hear the explanation come through Brandi\u0027s little lips ... so I\u0027ve got to ask. \"What do they say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a wicked smile and giggles. \"Good dancers are good in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi\u0027s words make me feel like a rock star. She definitely feeds my bruised ego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna test that theory?\" I ask. Okay, I\u0027m officially drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bites her bottom lip, assessing me like a car. I wonder if she thinks I\u0027m a Chevy or a Rolls Royce. She leans in and whispers in my ear, \"I\u0027m a good dancer, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull this sexy girl close. Her arms wrap around my neck and she presses against me. It\u0027s a hint of more to come. I\u0027m gonna let myself enjoy Brandi. She\u0027s a surefire solution to this pity party I\u0027ve been throwing myself for way too long. No doubt she\u0027s gonna make me forget about Maggie and everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how much alcohol I have in my system, but it\u0027s enough to make my head swim and make me believe the only girl I\u0027m interested in is the one pressing her hot body against mine, which is good. Very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go to your place,\" I tell her. I don\u0027t think Maggie or Damon would be too appreciative if they came back and caught me gettin\u0027 it on with a girl. And if Lenny found us ... hell, the guy might be demented enough to ask to join in the fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads me down the quad, tripping a couple of times. I steady her and she calls me her hero. Yeah, right. We stagger past the place I played football earlier, but she stops when we get to Dixon Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live here?\" I ask her as I fight the sobering thought that we might get caught by the Re-START posse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Don\u0027t worry, though. My roommate is out for the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads me up the stairs to the second floor. Damn. Her room is just down the hall from ours. Brandi doesn\u0027t have a suite like the one I\u0027m in-hers is just a small dorm room with two single beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch with lazy eyes as she stumbles over to the bed and unbuttons her shirt. She watches me with raised eyebrows as she pushes the material aside like curtains being opened to let in the daylight sun, revealing a lacy black bra that doesn\u0027t hide much. I like easy girls who don\u0027t expect me to be one of the good guys. If they wear lacy black bras, all the better. I whip my shirt off and walk toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your tattoo is so sexy,\" she purrs as we lie on the bed together. \"It\u0027s like black fire.\" I got my tattoo in Chicago as a symbol of my rebellion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing here with Brandi is a symbol of my rebellion, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe haven\u0027t kissed yet. I\u0027m not sure I even want to kiss her. And while that thought should be alarming me, I don\u0027t think about it too hard because (1) it\u0027s damn difficult to think straight when you\u0027re drunk, and (2) she maneuvers around to straddle me and my mind goes blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traces the tattoo on my biceps with her fingers. \"Wanna see mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kneels above me, turns around, and pulls down the back of her pants. Sure enough, she\u0027s got a tattoo of a red unicorn with rainbow wings right above her ass crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice,\" I say, but I\u0027m starting to feel anxious so I add, \"Show me what else you\u0027ve got.\" We\u0027d better get this party started because I should go back to my own room soon. I better not be missing when Damon and the rest of the crew comes back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi licks her heart-shaped lips as she twists back around and unbuttons her low-slung pants. \"I like a guy who knows what he wants. What do you want, Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m up for anything and everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" she says, raking her nails down my chest and moving lower. And lower. It hurts, and I think she\u0027s scratching off a layer or two of my skin. She slithers down my body, and I decide I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie back, welcoming what I know will come next. As her expert hands unsnap and unzip my jeans, then free me from confinement, I watch, my head spinning. She\u0027s having no problem focusing, even though she\u0027s as wasted as me. Everything she does is so well orchestrated; this girl is a total pro at more than just beer bongs. I close my eyes and tell my lower region to enjoy the attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am definitely into this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWay into this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo say I\u0027m turned on right now is an understatement of mega proportions. I\u0027m just not sure if it\u0027s a problem that behind my eyelids I\u0027m imagining a girl who limps and hates me...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you just say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh? \"What?\" I open my eyes and look down at Brandi, poised above my unzipped pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you just call me Maggie?\" she asks accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Whether I did or didn\u0027t, Brandi is definitely not Maggie. \"Sorry,\" I add lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"That\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, she reaches into her side table drawer and pulls out a little plastic bag. She picks out a yellow pill with a smiley face on it, pops it in her mouth, and breathes in slowly as she savors the taste. \"Here, take an Adam,\" she says, holding another one out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the pill. \"What\u0027s an Adam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Ecstasy. Take it and put it under your tongue. I promise you won\u0027t think about anything else but having a good time with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds great. I sit up and take the pill from her. If taking this little thing can make me forget everything except having a good time, I\u0027m all for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I\u0027m about to pop it into my mouth, I think about my mom. My mom is a prescription drug addict. Getting shitfaced drunk is bad enough, but taking pills ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngesting pills takes this thing to an entirely different level. I hand the pill back to her. \"I can\u0027t do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\" she asks hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move out from under her and pull up my jeans. \"I don\u0027t know. I need a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" she asks, now completely confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. I look Brandi up and down. She\u0027s totally got it goin\u0027 on. She\u0027s beautiful and has a rockin\u0027 bod ... but she\u0027s not Maggie. And while I don\u0027t want Maggie, or can\u0027t have Maggie, or whatever the hell it is that I can\u0027t put into a coherent thought because I\u0027m drunk, this isn\u0027t gonna work unless I can pull it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the bathroom?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down the hall. You okay? If you\u0027re thinking about buying protection out of the bathroom dispensers, you don\u0027t have to worry. I\u0027ve got some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head out the door and mumble, \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumble over to the guys\u0027 bathroom and lean over one of the sinks. This sucks. I should be enjoying my night off. Instead, I\u0027m a moody drunk. I look into the mirror in front of me, and it makes me feel worse. I run my hand through my messed-up hair and wonder if I should shave it all off like they did in juvie, \u0027cause right now I\u0027m not just a moody drunk ... I\u0027m a moody drunk who looks like shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s worse is I feel as bad as I look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI splash water on my face to help bring me out of this mood, but it\u0027s no use. Brandi was turning me on, but it wasn\u0027t Brandi making me hard. It was thoughts of Maggie. Twisted, I know. There\u0027s no way I can go through with this thing with a girl who\u0027s just a stand-in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head back toward her room. She\u0027s probably tripping by now and ready for some serious action. I hope she\u0027s not too pissed I\u0027m skipping out on her XTC party early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway, just as I\u0027ve got my hand on Brandi\u0027s doorknob, I hear Maggie\u0027s voice from behind me say, \"That\u0027s not our suite, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look toward the girl who\u0027s been haunting my nights ever since I was locked up in jail. The girl who just ruined my sexual escapade with Brandi without even knowing it. She\u0027s got hazel eyes that change with her mood, so different from the girl I was lying in bed with a few minutes ago. And while Maggie looks damn hot to me, I doubt she has any unicorn tats above her ass or wears lacy black bras. I\u0027d like to find out, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie limps over to me, her eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \"Then what are you doing out in the hall without a shirt on?\" She looks me up and down. \"And why are your, um, pants unbuttoned ... and unzipped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to Brandi\u0027s room opens and Brandi appears. Her hair is mussed, her pants are undone and hanging loosely on her hips, and she\u0027s got her shirt clenched against the front of her bra. I\u0027m screwed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Maggie mumbles, obviously getting her answer without me having to say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are,\" Brandi says with a smile, then looks over at Maggie. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His gir friend,\" Maggie answers with a stern, straight face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi looks from Maggie to me, then back to Maggie. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWELVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe girl with her barely there shirt clutched in front of her is waiting for an answer. Obviously she doesn\u0027t believe that a girl who looks like me could be dating a boy who looks like Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides clench in disgust. Caleb isn\u0027t my boyfriend and technically never was, but it still hurts to see him standing here in the hallway, his shirt off and pants unzipped, obviously ready to get it on with this girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t wait for him to tell the girl that the last person on earth he\u0027d call his girlfriend would be me. Whether it hurts or not, I promised Leah that I would look after Caleb. She senses he\u0027s in trouble. Leah\u0027s twin-ESP senses were right on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skipped the movie tonight after the youth group dinner because I was tired and my leg started to ache. Little did I know I\u0027d find Caleb here, like this, with another girl. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-9.html","bookId":2772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM"}
