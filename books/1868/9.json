I don\u0027t want to be late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll only take a sec,\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old girl was as hot-glued to her soccer sweetheart as I was to my vampire boyfriend. I would have been sickened if I didn\u0027t understand her amorous devotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she finally agreed. \"I could get Matt some candy. He loves red licorice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember when Becky and I would hang outside Paxx\u0027s and eat twines of red licorice until we felt ill. Now, instead of creating new memories with me, she was creating them with Matt. I turned to my best friend, who was wearing khakis and a pale blue button-down shirt. As long as I\u0027d known Becky, she\u0027d worn jeans and an oversized sweater. How long had I not noticed the change?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, it will give us a chance to hang out,\" she added kindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky was right. I\u0027d been so wrapped up in diverting the union between Trevor and Luna that I hadn\u0027t any time left to talk, or even open my eyes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we had beaus, we didn\u0027t cling to each other like we had before. Did that mean we didn\u0027t need each other at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been forever since we\u0027ve had girl time,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, it\u0027s great we have boyfriends, but I\u0027m missing our friendship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too!\" I said. \"We have to make time for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a pact,\" she said, extending her pinky finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pact,\" I said, entwining my own in hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than spending time apart, I felt like I was in the dark alone, not being able to share with my best friend the fact that our town was crawling with vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I tell you something, can you promise not to tell anyone? Not even Matt?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it about sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s even more top secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s more top secret than sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ready to spill my guts. To tell my best friend why my boyfriend was never seen in daylight. To explain to her why Jagger drove a hearse. Why the ghostlike Luna had suddenly come to Dullsville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Becky\u0027s cherub face looked so happy, her biggest concern being what new outfit to wear to school, what brand of candy treat to buy for Matt. I couldn\u0027t spoil her perfect world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re having a pop quiz in Shank\u0027s class tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duh,\" she said, rolling her eyes. \"Everyone knows that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked, almost horrified. \"Maybe I\u0027m losing my touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hunkered down in the vitamin-and-herb aisle, studying Mother Nature\u0027s remedies and filling my red plastic shopping basket with vitamin C and boxes of Garlic One gelcaps, when Becky finally caught up to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were feeling better,\" she said, holding several packages of red licorice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, but I want to stock up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garlic tablets?\" she asked, confused. \"I thought you were over your vampire obsession now that you are dating Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I just saw this commercial--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of Alexander,\" she interrupted excitedly, \"would you two want to meet up at Hatsy\u0027s Diner after the soccer game tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I tell my best friend no after we\u0027d just made a pinky- swear pact to hang out more? As long as I was with Alexander and Trevor was home sick, I reasoned, we were all safe. \"Yes, that\u0027s a great idea. I don\u0027t think Alexander\u0027s ever been to Hatsy\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I brought our purchases to the counter. We stood, unnoticed, as an elderly clerk hid behind a tabloid mag and her teenage clerkmate filed packets of developed prints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those two kids I was telling you about were in here last night,\" the elderly clerk gossiped. \"I think they are cousins of that weird mansion family on Benson Hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard they look like walking corpses,\" the younger one chimed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do. I just don\u0027t get why kids today think it\u0027s cool to look like they\u0027ve just come out of a coffin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard one of them drives a hearse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the elderly clerk put down her paper and spotted me. Her eyes bugged out like she\u0027d seen a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she apologized. \"Have you been waiting long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An eternity!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Jagger and Luna were beginning to make their presence known throughout Dullsville. Were they bored, careless, or marking their territory?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Trevor and I\u0027d spent our lives at each other\u0027s throats, I didn\u0027t want Luna and Jagger after his. Besides they were looking to do far more damage than wringing his neck. A mixture of emotions flooded through me--protecting a fellow Dullsvillian from a deadly duo, thwarting a plan to have a nefarious soccer snob wreaking havoc, and diverting a plot to have my nemesis turned into a vampire before I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d have to get these tablets to Trevor. At any moment, Jagger or Luna could strike--or in their case, bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough keeping up my new vampire identity was exhausting, I was really beginning to enjoy it. Everything I felt before as a vampire- obsessed goth I now had to live out--my distaste for the light and passion for darkness, having a secret identity, and being an insider instead of an outsider. I imagined the rest--flying high in Dullsville\u0027s sky, living in a spooky dungeon, Alexander and I cuddling the day away in a king-size coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sun began to set, I rode my bike to Trevor\u0027s, with my Paxx Pharmacy bag safely inside my Olivia Outcast backpack. I\u0027d already called Jameson and told him I\u0027d be a few minutes late to meet Alexander. It was crucial that I keep up my vampire charade and wait until darkness until I visited Trevor, just in case Trevor spilled my visit to Luna. If he shared with her that I\u0027d visited him after school the first day he was sick, Luna could assume Trevor was delirious from his cold medicine. But now that my nemesis was on the mend, I had to cover my tracks. I couldn\u0027t give them any reason to suspect I was still a mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting all day for you,\" Trevor said as he opened the front door. He was wearing plaid flannel pajama pants and a long- sleeve Big Ten surf shirt and was sporting a much healthier glow--a bad sign he\u0027d be coming back to school, but a good sign he hadn\u0027t been bitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You missed me?\" I asked with a saccharine grin. \"I thought you were Luna,\" he said, disappointed. \"We\u0027re not buying Ghoul Scout cookies today,\" he said, closing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly blocked the door with my boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m putting the final touches on my health project,\" I said, opening the door and stepping inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to feel better or put me in the morgue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have a choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you write down in your report the reason for Trevor Mitchell\u0027s illness. Two words: Raven Madison. I\u0027m sure the Infectious Disease Institute has heard of you,\" Trevor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored his rude comments and walked into his newly painted sunflower yellow kitchen, which still smelled like fresh paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard you\u0027ve been getting visits from a ghostly candy stripper. I mean, striper,\" I said with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like someone is jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out my Paxx Pharmacy bag and placed it on the granite- top kitchen island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom already got me medicine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a few things so I can get extra credit. Vitamin C, a bag of cough drops, and Garlic One capsules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garlic capsules? I\u0027ll smell like an Italian restaurant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re good for cardiovascular health. Should help you on the soccer field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you see all my trophies? I can play in my sleep,\" he said arrogantly. I was running out of options, and time. I had to go for the jugular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word on the street is, these are a major aphrodisiac. Gives off a scent that girls find irresistible. Something about pheromones. Anyway, someone like you shouldn\u0027t need it,\" I said, heading for the front door with the capsules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, wait,\" he said, catching up to me in the entranceway. \"Leave those here.\" He grabbed the package from my hand. \"Not for me, of course. For the guys on the team.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-9.html","bookId":1868,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM"}
