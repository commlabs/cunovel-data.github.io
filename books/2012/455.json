Bottle. Koryk. Even Tarr. And Smiles … smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her squad-mates saw that, they convulsed as if gut-stabbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying jammed in a crack between two stones a third of the way down the slope, half buried beneath Kolansii corpses, and feeling the blood draining away from the deep, mortal wounds in his chest, Cuttle heard that laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in his mind he went back, and back. Childhood. The battles they fought, the towering redoubts they defended, the sunny days of dust and sticks for swords and running this way and that, where time was nothing but a world without horizons – and the days never closed, and every stone felt perfect in the palm of the hand, and when a bruise arrived, or a cut opened red, why he need only run to his ma or da, and they would take his shock and indignation and make it all seem less important – and then that disturbance would be gone, drifting into the time of before, and ahead there was only the sun and the brightness of never growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the stones and sweat and blood here in his last resting place, Cuttle smiled, and then he whispered to them in his mind, You should have seen our last stands. They were something .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were something .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness, and then brightness – brightness like a summer day without end. He went there, without a single look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying beneath the weight of the chains, the Crippled God, who had been listening, now heard. Long-forgotten, half-disbelieved emotions rose up through him, ferocious and bright. He drew a sharp breath, feeling his throat tighten. I will remember this. I will set out scrolls and burn upon them the names of these Fallen. I will make of this work a holy tome, and no other shall be needed .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHear them! They are humanity unfurled, laid out for all to see – if one would dare look!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere shall be a Book and it shall be written by my hand. Wheel and seek the faces of a thousand gods! None can do what I can do! Not one can give voice to this holy creation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is not bravado. For this, my Book of the Fallen, the only god worthy of its telling is the crippled one. The broken one. And has it not always been thus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never hid my hurts .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never disguised my dreams .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I never lost my way .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd only the fallen can rise again .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened to the laughter, and suddenly the weight of those chains was as nothing. Nothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They have resurr—’ Brother Grave stopped. He turned, faced the dark hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, High Watered Haggraf’s eyes slowly widened – and on all sides the Kolansii soldiers were looking up at the barrow, the weapons in their hands sagging. More than a few took a backward step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs laughter rolled down to them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Brother Grave pushed harshly through the soldiers, marching towards the corpse-strewn foot of the hill, Haggraf followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pure halted five paces beyond the milling, disordered ranks, stared upward. He flung Haggraf a look drawn taut with incredulity. ‘Who are these foreigners?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Watered could only shake his head, a single motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Grave’s face darkened. ‘There are but a handful left – there will be no retreat this time, do you understand me? No retreat! I want them all cut down!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forkrul Assail glared at the soldiers. ‘Form up, all of you! Prepare to advance!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, from the hill, deathly silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Grave smiled. ‘Hear that? They know that it is over!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint whistling in the air, and then Haggraf grunted in pain, staggering to one side – an arrow driven through his left shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Grave spun to him, glared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth clenching, Haggraf tore the iron point from his shoulder, almost collapsing from the burst of agony as blood streamed down. Staring down at the glistening sliver of wood in his hand, he saw that it was Kolansii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling, Brother Grave wheeled and forced his way back through the press of soldiers. He would join this assault – he would ride his Jhag horse to the very top, cutting down every fool who dared stand in his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, seeping in from the soldiers surrounding him, he could hear whispers of dread and fear, and beneath that palpable bitterness there was something else – something that forced its way through his utter command of their bodies, their wills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were hardened veterans, one and all. By their hands they had delivered slaughter, upon foes armed and unarmed, at the command of the Forkrul Assail. They had been slaves for years now. And yet, like a black current beneath the stone of his will, Brother Grave sensed emotions that had nothing to do with a desire to destroy the enemy now opposing them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-455.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
