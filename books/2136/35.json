{"id":95181,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs I hiked back from the dome, still reeling from yet another encounter with God - or, perhaps more accurately, the Source - I sent a text message to Tara Thurman: We need to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reply came a few minutes later, as I slid and skated down the muddy trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me at my bungalow in twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNature walk, I texted and shoved my phone in my hip pocket before the rain could short-circuit something. I might be able to do a lot of things, but magically fix my iPhone wasn\u0027t one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the bungalow, I let Allison know we were expecting a guest. Allison read my mind, shook her head, and went immediately into the kitchen and took out a big carving knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s one of them, Sammie,\" she said, slipping it inside her waistband, and then yelping loudly when the point bit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snickered and reminded her that the entity, as far as we knew, could only jump from one body at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we don\u0027t know that for sure, Sam. In fact, we know very little about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is why I want to talk to Tara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison still didn\u0027t like it, except this time she gingerly slipped the knife inside her waistband. I chuckled and took a shower. Showers were still one of my few great pleasures in this new life of mine, and I reveled in the warmth it provided, always reluctant to leave. Even after the shower was long off, I stood there briefly in the stall, the heat and steam, and watched the water drip down my still-pale skin. Pale and flawless, granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I thought. Pale and dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw on my last pair of dry jeans, then tossed my sopping-wet clothes in the bungalow\u0027s washer. I\u0027d just turned it on and was toweling my hair when a gentle rap came on the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of someone gently rapping, I thought, thinking of the Edgar Allan Poe poem, rapping at my chamber door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I reached for the door, I mentally reminded Allison to guard her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood...and reached down and adjusted the knife at her hip. I might have detected a small spot of blood appearing through her jeans where the point had poked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI next remembered the words of the Source: They operate out of fear, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear of moving on, fear of giving up power, fear of retribution. They are, quite simply, misinformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMisinformed or not, the being that possessed the Thurmans was, I suspected, desperate and powerful. A hell of a dangerous combination. But I would not fear it, whatever it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smallest match can illuminate the darkest room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door, stepped aside, and let the Devil in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-35.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
