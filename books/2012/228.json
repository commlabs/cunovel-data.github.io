She stared across at him, thinking how lost he looked. But no. That’s just me. It’s just me. He knows what he needs to know. He’s worked it all out. It comes with the blood .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Cellows stumped up to Yedan. ‘Prince – she’s alive, but unconscious. The witches used her—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know,’ he replied, studying the killing field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant, burly and hulking – a touch of Teblor blood in him – followed his gaze and grunted. ‘They hurt us this time, sire. The Hounds mauled the centre and the right flank. One of the beasts reached the wounded before Pully drove it back. But our losses, sire. They hurt us. Nithe, Aysgan, Trapple, Pithy—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan shot him a hard look. ‘Pithy?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCellows pointed with a finger that had been cut off just below the knuckle. ‘There.’ A figure slumped in a weeping soldier’s arms. Brevity kneeling nearby, head lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘See to what needs to be done, Sergeant. Wounded. Weapons.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sire – er, Prince?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seems I’m the last.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The last?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘From your original company, sir. Coast Patrol.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan felt something crunch at the back of his mouth. He winced, leaned over and spat. ‘Shit, broke a tooth.’ He lifted his eyes, stared across at Cellows. ‘I want you in reserve.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sire?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For when I need you the most, Sergeant. For when I need you at my side. Until then, you are to remain out of the fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sire—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But when I call, you’d better be ready.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man saluted, and then strode away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My last,’ Yedan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squinted at Brevity. If all these eyes were not upon me, I would walk to you, Brevity. I would take you in my arms. I would share your grief. You deserve that much. We both do. But I can show nothing like … that .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, suddenly unsure. Probed his broken tooth with his tongue. Tasted blood. ‘Shit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrevity looked up as the shadow fell over her. ‘Prince.’ She struggled to stand but Yedan reached out, and the weight of his hand pushed her back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to speak. But he said nothing, though his eyes were now on Pithy and the soldiers gathering around the fallen woman. She forced herself to follow his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were lifting her so gently she thought her heart would rupture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s no easy thing,’ murmured Yedan, ‘to earn that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal Forge saw the enclaves encamped on the surrounding mounds slowly stirring awake, saw the soldiers assembling. This will be the one, then. When we throw our elites through the gate. Legions of Light. Lord Kadagar Fant, why did you wait this long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they had gone through from the first, the Shake would have fallen by now. Make the first bite the deepest. Every commander knows this. But you wouldn’t listen. You wanted to bleed your people first, to make your cause theirs .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it hasn’t worked. They fight because you give them no choice. The pot-throwers dry their hands and the wheel slows and then stops. The weavers lock up their looms. The wood-carvers put away their tools. The road-menders, the lamp-makers, the hawkers of songbirds and the dog-skinners, the mothers and the whores and the consorts and the drug-peddlers – they all set down the things they would do, to fight this war of yours .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all stops, and for so many now will never start again .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve ripped out the side of your people, left a gaping wound – a wound like the one before us. And we flow through it like blood. We spill out and scab up on the other side .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Soletaken were all sembled now. They knew what needed to be done. And as the ranks drew up, Aparal saw his Eleint-fouled kin take position, each at the head of his or her own elite soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a Hust Legion awaits us. Slayers of Hounds and Dragons, in all the mad laughter of war .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis next battle. It will be our last .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up to the battlements, but Kadagar was not there. And from his soldiers resting on all sides, his commoners so bloodied, so utterly ruined, Aparal heard the same words. ‘ He comes. Our lord shall lead us .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lord. Our very own rag doll .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Water, Highness. Drink.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barely had strength to guide the mouthpiece to her lips. Like rain in a desert, the water flowed through the ravaged insides of her mouth. Lacerated tissues stung awake, her throat opened in relief. She pulled it away, gasping. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-228.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
