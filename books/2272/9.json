Once upon a time, Raif Green would have been wolfing down a hamburger anywhere that served up hot, greasy food. Tom Dooley would have chosen corned beef on rye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, as he had discovered when he called Raif, Tom Dooley had suffered a heart attack two years ago. No doughnuts for these cops anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif had opted for the Greek salad, while Tom was nibbling his turkey, low-fat Swiss, lettuce and tomato on wheat, as if by taking small bites he could make the sandwich last longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas Dooley was a big man. He’d lost weight since Joe had seen him last, but he was still six-four and just shy of three-hundred pounds. Raif wasn’t really all that small or thin—five-ten and one-eighty, maybe—but next to Tom Dooley, he looked like a midget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men were in their early forties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth still had their hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were like Laurel and Hardy in size and appearance, but there was nothing comedic about the work they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Raif said. “It’s Saturday, we should be off, but here we are—working. You know, this may be a democracy but Joe Schmo in the streets gets knocked off and it’s nine to five. Bigelow…well, he was a big cheese. No one is off until we solve this one.” He cast Joe a crooked grin. “At least we can eat light and fit, with you picking up the tab. There’s the problem with heart-healthy. It’s expensive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d kill for a fry,” Tom said. His round face was deceptive. He looked so amiable, but in an interrogation room, he was about as amiable as King Kong on steroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, one day, order some fries,” Raif said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom shook his head. “My wife would kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is your wife here, Tom?” Raif demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear, that woman should be the detective. She’s got surveillance everywhere,” Raif said, shaking his head. “Hell. She’s got eyes in the flipping lettuce, I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re getting old. Talking about food,” Raif said to Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The way of the world,” Joe assured him. “Your wife just wants you alive, Tom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said sheepishly. “Man, this is rabbit food, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe nodded sympathetically, and asked, “What’s your take on the Poe angle? Motive or smoke screen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So far?” Raif wiped his mouth with his paper napkin. “So far, we don’t have a hell of a lot to go on. What you saw in the papers is pretty much what we have. I wanted to conceal the note, but there was a leak—not a big surprise, there were uniforms all over the place before we got there. The crime-scene guys had a nightmare, trying to figure it all out. First the son gets there and gets hysterical, then the sister-in-law…and the butler, to boot. Everyone decides they’re going to save him. People calling 9-1-1, med techs all over. It looked like he’d had a heart attack or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the deal on the butler?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif shook his head. “You think it might be as easy as the butler did it? I don’t think so. He’s a skinny old English guy, and he was totally shaken. His name is Albee Bennet. He was in tears when we interviewed him, and he didn’t know a thing. He has his own little apartment in the building, and he was there napping when it happened. Never saw or heard anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believe him?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Raif said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believed him, too. You know, it’s that sixth sense you get about people after doing this job for so many years,” Tom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, he was there. And the son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First one on the scene. He’d been out. But he lived there—came and went all the time,” Tom told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your take on him?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif shrugged. “His tears seemed real, too. Young guy, early thirties. We asked around, and it seems he and his dad didn’t have any major problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The sister-in-law?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary Vincenzo. His late-brother’s wife,” Tom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll interview her, I’m sure,” Raif said dryly. “But I don’t see it. She’s real thin, one of those nervous types. Wealthy in her own right. The brother left her part of the family fortune already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should have seen them wiping their lips when they heard it was poison,” Tom commented, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of poison didn’t in the least deter him from his enjoyment of his sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, I just want to hear it beginning-to-end. The med techs were there? How soon did they discover that it was a crime scene, if everyone thought it was a heart attack?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty darned quick, thanks to one of the bright boys with fire rescue,” Raif informed him. “He stopped them from moving the body when he noticed it was cold. But, actually, they were right to think it. I mean, say your grandmother or someone in your house dies in the middle of the night, and you call 9-1-1. They’re taught to try mouth-to-mouth. Even if you’re sure they’re dead. Anyway, the body is cold, and this kid is bright. And because it’s an unexplained death, he tells the head guy on his team that they need the cops. The cops come, and then the medical examiner’s office gets out there. Doc Arbitter is on, and he figures out it could be poison in the wine. So at least there’s photo documentation of just about everything. Everything after the family and EMTs have moved everything to hell and gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So was the note found?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right on his desk. Just one piece of paper among a bunch of others—no one even noticed it at first. Looked like—and forensics proved—it had come right out of his own printer. Computer was dusted, of course, and there weren’t any prints, so it had been wiped down,” Tom told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was the timing? And why did the sister-in-law show up?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The son showed up first to tell his dad it was time to go. And he’d already been to get his aunt. They were all going to some dinner party. The butler didn’t come out until after the son and sister-in-law arrived,” Tom explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif continued the report. “When the son walked in, it looked like the old man had been drinking his special vintage wine, and then just keeled over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was just one wineglass?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one,” Raif said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom waved what was left of his turkey-and-Swiss in the air. “In a nutshell, we think Bigelow was alone. He was due at that dinner party at eight, and he’d been dead about an hour when he was found. He had a visitor earlier, though. He last spoke to the butler around five and told him someone was coming before closing himself into his office. But whoever it was must have come and gone, because Bigelow was drinking alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe shrugged. “Either that, or the killer took his wineglass with him. Anyone check to see if a glass was missing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom flushed and looked at Raif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Raif admitted, reddening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one saw anyone come or go?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one. The chauffeur was waiting for them out in the garage, sleeping behind the wheel, by his own admission,” Tom said. “And, yes, we canvassed the neighborhood. No one saw anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the—the other Ravens?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve spoken with them. They all claim to have alibis, but we have a lot of legwork to do, checking them all out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything you can tell me about the family?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif looked at Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, you know I’m licensed, and I’ve been hired by an interested party,” Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, okay. We’ve got some files on the rest of the board. I’ll fax ’em to you,” Raif said. “I’d just as soon you not mention it around, though. Some guys on the force aren’t all that fond of outside interest, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do know. And thanks,” Joe told him. He hesitated, then asked. “What do you think about that woman on TV, the one who claimed to be psychic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif and Tom exchanged glances again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe groaned softly. “Oh, Lord. You two believed her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom laughed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif’s lips twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Joe demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jerry Grant in vice has picked her up at least three times,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For fraud?” Joe suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, no,” Raif said. “Vice doesn’t handle fraud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He picked her up for prostitution,” Tom said. “I noticed that last night she was going by Lori Star. When the cops picked her up, she was going by Candy Cane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She did say she was an actress,” Joe said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. She’s put on a few innocent acts at the station, all right,” Raif said. “Still, we’re going to talk to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, as soon as Tom Turkey here finishes his sandwich,” Raif said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind if I tag along?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell, we’re on your dime today,” Tom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaif was staring at him. “You don’t think it would bother you?” he asked. “Your cousin’s fiancée…that Leslie MacIntyre. She was supposed to be the real deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should definitely go. I’ll know the real thing when I see it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Latham was an all-around good guy. Thirty-six years old, married and the father of two young children. He worked in the editorial department of one of the major publishers, and he simply loved books, especially mysteries, and joined scholars everywhere in considering Edgar Allan Poe to be the father of the detective novel. Genevieve had met him through her mother, and though she couldn’t say she knew him well, she had always liked him, his wife and their kids, Vickie, eleven, and Geoffrey, fourteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she arrived at the hospital, she expected something more than what she found: a quiet hallway; Dorothy, Sam’s wife, in the room with him; and a woman who introduced herself as his mother, Stella, returning with coffee from the hospital cafeteria. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-death-dealer-harrison-investigation-6/page-9.html","bookId":2272,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:03 PM"}
