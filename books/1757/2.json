He had had scarcely time to do more than see his ship, the Shooting Starr, safely stowed in the underground hangar. He had met only the technicians who had handled the landing red tape and seen to his ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose technicians, that is, and Scott Mindes, engineer in charge of Project Light. It had been almost as though the young man had been lying in wait. Almost at once he had suggested a trip to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo see some of the sights, he had explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky did not believe that, of course. The engineer\u0027s small-chinned face had been haunted with trouble, and his mouth twitched as he spoke. His eyes slid away from L\u0027ucky\u0027s cool, level glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Lucky agreed to visit the surface. As yet, all he knew of the troubles on Mercury was that they posed a ticklish problem for the Council of Science. He was willing to go along with Mindes and see where that led him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Bigman Jones, he was always glad to follow Lucky anywhere and any time, for any reason and no reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Bigman whose eyebrows lifted as all three were getting into their suits. He nodded almost unno-ticeably toward the holster attachment on Mindes\u0027s suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded calmly in return. He, too, had noticed that protruding from the holster was the butt of a heavy-caliber blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young engineer stepped out onto the surface of the planet first. Lucky Starr followed and Bigraan came last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, they lost contact with one another in the nearly total darkness. Only the stars were visible, bright and hard in the cold airlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman recovered first. The gravity here on Mercury was almost exactly equal to that on his native Mars. The Martian nights were almost as dark. The stars in its night sky were almost as brilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis treble voice sounded brightly in the receivers of the others. \"Hey, I\u0027m beginning to make things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo was Lucky, and the fact puzzled him. Surely starlight could not be that bright. There was a faint, luminous haze that lay over the fumbled landscape and touched its sharp crags with a pale milkiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky had seen something of the sort on the Moon during its two-week-long night. There, also, was the completely barren landscape, rough and broken. Never, in millions of years, either there on the Moon or here on Mercury, had there been the softening touch of wind or rain. The bare rock, colder than imagination could picture, lay without a touch of frost in a waterless world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the Moon\u0027s night, too, there had been this milkiness. But there, over half the M\u0027oon at least, there had been Earth-light. When Earth was full it shone with sixteen times the brightness of the full Moon as seen from Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere on Mercury, at the Solar Observatory at the North Pole, there was no near-by planet to account for the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that starlight?\" he finally asked, knowing it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Mindes said wearily, \"That\u0027s the coronal glimmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great Galaxy,\" said Lucky with a light laugh. \"The corona! Of course! I should have known!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\u0027Known what?\" cried Bigman. \"What\u0027s going on? Hey, Mindes, come on, give!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindes said, \"Turn around. You\u0027ve got your back to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all turned. Lucky whistled softly between his teeth; Bigman yelped with surprise. Mindes said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA section of the horizon was etched sharply against a pearly region of the sky. Every pointed irregularity of that part of the horizon was in keen focus. Above it, the sty was in a soft glow (fading with height) a third of the way to the zenith. The glow consisted of bright, curving streamers of pale light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the corona, Mr. Jones,\" said Mindes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in his astonishment Bigman was not forgetful of his own conception of the proprieties. He growled, \"Call me Bigman.\" Then he said, \"You mean the corona around the Sun? I didn\u0027t think it was that big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a million miles deep or more,\" said Mindes, \"and we\u0027re on Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. We\u0027re only thirty million miles from the Sun right now. You\u0027re from Mars, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Born and bred,\" said Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you could see the Sun right now, you\u0027d find it was thirty-six times as big as it is when seen from Mars, and so\u0027s the corona. And thirty-six times as bright too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded. Sun and corona would be nine times as large as seen from Earth. And the corona could not be seen at all on Earth, except during periods of total eclipse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Mindes had not altogether lied. There were sights to be seen on Mercury. He tried to fill out the corona, to imagine the Sun it surrounded which was now hidden just below the horizon. It would be a majestic sight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindes went on, an unmistakable bitterness in his voice. \"They call this light \u0027the white ghost of the Sun.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I like that. A rather good phrase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rather good?\" said Mindes savagely. \"I don\u0027t think so. There\u0027s too much talk about ghosts on this planet. This planet\u0027s all jinx. Nothing ever goes right on it. The mines failed...\" His voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky thought: We\u0027ll let that simmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAloud he said, \"Where is this phenomenon we were to see, Mindes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. We\u0027ll have to walk a bit. Not far, considering the gravity, but watch your footing. We don\u0027t have roads here, and the coronal glimmer can be awfully confusing. I suggest the helmet lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked his on as he spoke, and a shaft of light sprang out from above the face-plate, turning the ground into a rough patchwork of yellow and black. Two other lights flashed on, and the three figures moved forward on their thickly insulated boots. They made no sound in the vacuum, but each could sense the soft vibrations set up by each footfall in the air within their suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindes seemed to be brooding about the planet as he walked. He said in a low, tense voice, \"I hate Mercury. I\u0027ve been here six months, two Mermurian years, and I\u0027m sick of it. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be here more than six months to begin with, and here the time\u0027s up and nothing\u0027s done. Nothing. Everything about this place is wrong. It\u0027s the smallest planet. It\u0027s the closest to the Sun. Only one side faces the Sun. Over there\"-and his arm swung in the direction of the corona\u0027s gleam- \"is the Sun-side, where it gets hot enough in places to melt lead and boil sulfur. Over there in the other direction\"-again his arm swung-\"is the one planetary surface in the whole Solar System that never sees the Sun. Everything about the place is miserable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused to jump over a shallow, six-foot-wide rift in the surface, a reminder of some eons-old Mercury-quake, perhaps, which could not heal over without wind and weather. He made the jump clumsily, the picture of an Earthman who, even on Mercury, stayed close to the artificial gravity of the Observatory Dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman clicked his tongue disapprovingly at the sight. He and Lucky negotiated the jump with scarcely anything more than a lengthening of stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quarter mile farther on, Mindes said abruptly, \"We can see it from here, and just in time too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, teetering forward, with arms outflung for balance. Bigman and Lucky halted with a small hop which kicked up a spurt of gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindes\u0027s helmet flash went out. He was pointing. Lucky and Bigman put out their own lights and there, in the darkness, where Mindes had pointed, was a small, irregular splotch of white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was brilliant, a more burning sunshine than Lucky had ever seen on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the best angle for seeing it,\" said Mindes. \"It\u0027s the top of Black and White Mountain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that its name?\" asked Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. You see why, don\u0027t you? It stands just far enough nightward of the Terminator... That\u0027s the boundary between the dark-side and the Sun-side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" said Bigman indignantly. \"You think I\u0027m ignorant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just explaining. There\u0027s this little spot around the North Pole, and another around the South Pole, where the Terminator doesn\u0027t move much as Mercury circles the sun. Down at the Equator, now, the Terminator moves seven hundred miles in one direction for forty-four days and then seven hundred miles back in the next forty-four. Here it just moves half or mile or so altogether, which is why this is a good place for an observatory. The Sun and the stars stand still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, Black and White Mountain is just far enough away so that only the top half of it is lit up at most. Then, as the Sun creeps away, the light moves up the mountain slopes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now,\" interposed Lucky, \"only the peak is lit up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the top foot or two maybe, and that will be gone soon. It will be all dark for an Earth-day or two, and then the light starts coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he spoke the white splotch shrank to a dot that burned like a bright star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three men waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look away,\" advised Mindes, \"so that your eyes get accustomed to darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after slow minutes he said, \"All right, look back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky and Bigman did so and for a while saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was as though the landscape had turned bloody. Or a piece of it had, at any rate. First there was just the sensation of redness. Then it could be made out, a rugged mountain climbing up to a peak. The peak was brightly red now, the red deepening and fading as the eye traveled downward until all was black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" asked Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sun,\" said Mindes, \"has sunk just low enough now so that, from the mountain peak, all that remains above the horizon is the corona and the prominences. The prominences are jets of hydrogen gas that lift thousand of miles above the Sun\u0027s surface, and they\u0027re a bright red in color. Their light is there all the time, but ordinary sunlight drowns it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Lucky nodded. The prominences were again something which on Earth could be seen only during a total eclipse or with special instruments, thanks to the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact,\" added Mindes in a low voice, \"they call this \u0027the red ghost of the Sun.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s two ghosts,\" said Lucky suddenly, \"a white one and a red one. Is it because of the ghosts that you carry a blaster, Mr. Mindes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindes shouted, \"What?\" Then, wildly, \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying,\" said Lucky, \"that it\u0027s time you told us why you really brought us out here. Not just for the sights, I\u0027m sure, or you wouldn\u0027t carry a blaster on an empty, desolate planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a while for Mindes to answer. When he did, he said, \"You\u0027re David Starr, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" said Lucky patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a member of the Council of Science. You\u0027re the man they call Lucky Starr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMembers of the Council of Science shunned publicity, and it was with a certain reluctance that Lucky said again, \"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m not wrong. You\u0027re one of their ace investigators, and you\u0027re here to investigate Project Light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s lips thinned as they pressed together. He would much rather that were not so easily known. He said, \"Maybe that\u0027s true, maybe it isn\u0027t. Why did you bring me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s true, and I brought you here\"-Mindes was panting-\"to tell you the truth before the others could fill you-full of-lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the failures that have been haunting-I hate that word-the failures in Project Light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you might have told me what you wanted to back at the Dome. Why bring me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For two reasons,\" said the engineer. His breathing continued rapid and difficult. \"In the first place, they all think it\u0027s my fault. They think I can\u0027t pull the project through, that I\u0027m wasting tax money. I wanted to get you away from them. Understand? I wanted to keep you from listening to them first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should they think it\u0027s your fault?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They think I\u0027m too young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky Starr, who wasn\u0027t very much older, said, \"And your second reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you to get the feeling of Mercury. I wanted you to absorb the-the-- \" He fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s suited figure stood straight and tall on Mercury\u0027s forbidding surface, and the metal of one shoulder caught and reflected the milky light of the corona, \"the white ghost of the Sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Very well, Mindes, suppose I accept your statement that you are not responsible for failures in the project. Who is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engineer\u0027s voice was a vague mutter at first. It coalesced gradually into words. \"I don\u0027t know- At least... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand you,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" said Mindes desperately, \"I\u0027ve investigated. I spent waking and sleeping periods trying to pinpoint the blame. I watched everybody\u0027s movements. I noted times when accidents took place, when there were breaks in the cables or when conversion plates were smashed. And one thing I\u0027m sure of-- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That nobody at the Dome can be directly responsible. Nobody. There are only about fifty people in the Dome, fifty-two to be exact, and the last six times something has gone wrong I\u0027ve been able to account for each one. Nobody was anywhere near the scenes of the accidents.\" His voice had gone high-pitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Then how do you account for the accidents? Mercury-quakes? Action of the Sun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ghosts!\" cried the engineer wildly, flinging his arms about. \"There\u0027s a white ghost and a red ghost. You\u0027ve seen those. But there are two-legged ghosts too. I\u0027ve seen them, but will anyone believe me?\" He was almost incoherent. \"I tell you... I tell you... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Ghosts! Are you nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once Mindes screamed, \"You don\u0027t believe me either. But I\u0027ll prove it. I\u0027ll blast the ghost. I\u0027ll blast the fools who won\u0027t believe me. I\u0027ll blast everyone. Everyone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a harsh screech of laughter he had drawn his blaster, and with frenzied speed, before Bigman could move to stop him, he had aimed it at Lucky at point-blank range and squeezed its trigger. Its invisible field of disruption lashed out... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-big-sun-of-mercury-lucky-starr-4/page-2.html","bookId":1757,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM"}
