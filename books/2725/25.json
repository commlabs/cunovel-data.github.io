If I hadn’t just had a fight with my mother, I never would have had we’ll always have summer · 135\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe nerve to quit like that. Even though people came and went all the time at Behrs, especially students … still. I went straight back to the kitchen and found my manager, Stacey, and told her I was sorry, but as it turned out I was getting married in two months and I couldn’t keep working there. Stacey eyed my stomach and then my ring finger and said, “Congratulations, Isabel. Just so you know, there’s always a place for you here at Behrs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone in my car again, I cried loud, ragged sobs. I cried until my throat hurt. I was mad at my mom, but bigger than that was this overwhelming, heavy sadness. I was grown up enough to do things on my own, without her. I could get married, I could quit my job. I was a big girl now. I didn’t have to ask for her permission. My mother was no longer all powerful. Part of me wished she still could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were half an hour from Cousins when Jeremiah called and said, “Conrad’s been staying in Cousins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whole body went stiff. We were at a stoplight, and Jeremiah’s car was in front of mine. “Since when?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since last week. He just stayed after the whole thing at the restaurant. He came back once to get his stuff, but I think he’s gonna spend the summer out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I said. “Do you think he’ll mind that I’m staying there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Jere hesitate. “No, I don’t think he’ll mind. I just wish I could be there too. If it wasn’t for that stupid internship, I could be. Maybe I should just quit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t. Your dad will kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know.” I heard him hesitate again, and then he said, “I don’t feel right about the way we left things with your mom. Maybe you should go back home, Bells.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t work. We’ll just fight again.” The light turned green. “You know, I actually think this could be for the best. It’ll give us both space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you say so,” Jeremiah said, but I could tell he didn’t completely agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s talk more when we get to the house,” I said, and we hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis news that Conrad was in Cousins left me feeling uneasy. Maybe staying at the summer house wasn’t the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, when I pulled into the empty driveway, I felt such incredible relief to be back. Home, I was back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house looked the same, tall and gray and white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me feel the same. Like I was right where I belonged. Like I could breathe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sitting in Jeremiah’s lap on a lounge chair when we heard a car pull up. It was Conrad, getting out of the car with a bag of groceries. He looked taken aback to see us sitting there on the deck. I stood up and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah stretched his hands behind his head and leaned back onto his chair. “Hey, Con.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up,” he said, walking over to us. “What are you guys doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad set down the grocery bag and took a seat next to Jeremiah’s, and I just sort of hovered above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wedding stuff,” Jeremiah said vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wedding stuff,” Conrad repeated. “So you guys are really doing it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell yeah we are.” Jeremiah pulled me back onto his lap. “Right, wifey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t call me wifey,” I said, wrinkling my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gross.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad ignored me. “Does that mean Laurel’s changed her mind?” he asked Jere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet, but she will,” Jeremiah said, and I didn’t correct him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat perched there for about twenty more seconds before I twisted out of his arms and stood up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starving,” I said, leaning down and poking around Conrad’s grocery bag. “Did you buy anything good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad gave me his bemused half smile. “No Cheetos or frozen pizza for you in here. Sorry. I got stuff for dinner, though. I’ll cook something for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up, took the grocery bag, and went into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor dinner, Conrad made a tomato, basil, and avocado salad, and he grilled chicken br**sts. We ate outside on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a mouth full of chicken, Jeremiah said, “Wow, I’m impressed. Since when do you cook?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since I’ve been living on my own. This is pretty much all I eat. Chicken. Every day.” Conrad pushed the salad we’ll always have summer · 139\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebowl toward me, not looking up. “Did you get enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Thanks, Conrad. This is all really good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really good,” Jeremiah echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad only shrugged, but the tips of his ears turned pink, and I knew he was pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poked Jeremiah in the arm with my fork. “You could learn a thing or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked me back. “So could you.” He took a big bite of salad before announcing, “Belly’s gonna stay here until the wedding. Is that cool with you, Con?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell Conrad was surprised, because he didn’t answer right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t be in your way,” I told him. “I’ll just be doing wedding stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine. I don’t care,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my plate. “Thanks,” I said. So I’d been worried about nothing. Conrad didn’t care if I was there or not. It wasn’t like we would have to hang out with each other. He would do his own thing the way he always did, I would be busy planning the wedding, and Jeremiah would drive up every Friday to help. It would be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we finished eating dinner, Jeremiah suggested we all go get ice cream for dessert. Conrad declined, saying he would clean up. I said, “The cook shouldn’t have to clean up,” but he said he didn’t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJere and I went into town, just the two of us. I got a scoop of cookies and cream and a scoop of cookie dough with sprinkles, in a waffle cone. Jeremiah got rainbow sherbet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you feeling better?” he asked me as we walked around the boardwalk. “About what happened with your mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really,” I said. “I’d rather just not think about it anymore today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah nodded. “Whatever you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed the subject. “Did you figure out how many people you want to invite?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.” He started to tick names off on his fingers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-25.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
