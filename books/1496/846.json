I can only imagine how important a treasured item like this would be to the Celestial….” Having reached this point in his train of thought, Bai Xiaochun glanced around subconsciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators that had previously been stationed here to guard the Underworld River Restricted Area were nowhere to be seen, leaving him completely alone. Perhaps it was the doing of the gravekeeper, or perhaps they left because of the shocking battle and the destruction of the Great Wall. The entire structure of the Wildlands would be changing. At this point, he gritted his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fudge. What the hell am I afraid of? Great-Grandpa Gravekeeper gave this to me! It\u0027s mine now! Besides, according to what Great-Grandpa Gravekeeper said, if I absorb this life force, my Undying Bones will climb to the very peak. Even if this hair belonged to someone more powerful, I would still absorb it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the tempering he had experienced in the Wildlands, Bai Xiaochun had become somewhat more courageous than he had been in the past. Therefore, he found an area in the Underworld River Restricted Area that was suitable to hew out a temporary immortal\u0027s cave, and then went into seclusion to cultivate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere else in the Wildlands, in what seemed like a different dimension, there was a huge black river that was none other than the Underworld River.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as black as night, and yet, it was still possible to see a huge palace at the very end of the swirling river water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe palace was also black, and very sinister in appearance as it rose up over the river water. There was something consummately powerful about it, and there was a constant stream of souls which flew toward it, encircled it, and then vanished on their way to being reincarnated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was none other than the Hell-Emperor Palace!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis place controlled reincarnation, and determined matters of life and death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one of the grand halls in that palace, two rows of statues could be seen lining the walls, that looked like underworld generals. At the very end of the hall, beyond the statues, was a huge throne made of black bones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the gravekeeper appeared, walking through the hall until he was at the throne, upon which he sat down. He was surrounded by a domineering aura, making him seem like a paragon or a god. He wore an imperial crown, as well as a black robe embroidered with an underworld dragon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the wave of a sleeve, he caused Bai Hao to materialize right in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was clearly ill at ease. He looked around at the awe-inspiring hall with its profound aura of death, and then turned to look at the gravekeeper, who sat there on his throne, face completely expressionless. Bai Hao quickly bowed his head and clasped hands in greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Hao!” the gravekeeper said, his eyes shining brightly, and his voice echoing like heavenly thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravekeeper seemed very different than he had when talking with Bai Xiaochun earlier. Right now, he absolutely seemed like the mighty Hell-Emperor!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Hao could tell that, and a very serious expression overtook his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen well, Bai Hao!” the gravekeeper continued, his voice thrumming with mysterious power that pierced into his soul body and resonated with his very soul. Because of this, the gravekeeper would be able to see the tiniest fluctuations in Bai Hao’s soul, and would know instantly whether or not he was lying or telling the truth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Xiaochun is currently your Master, and will be in the future! Although I took it upon myself to change your fate, all I did was place you at Bai Xiaochun’s side. He was the one who took you as an apprentice; it was not my arrangement. It was simply your destiny!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Furthermore, the reason you have become my successor is not because I approve of you, but rather… because your Master Bai Xiaochun approves of you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember well: your mission is not to guard the Underworld River, nor is it to look over reincarnation. Instead… you are to help your Master in caring for the Underworld River. You are to defend your Master! And if you ever betray him, the Underworld River itself will ensure that you are killed in body and soul!” As he spoke, the gravekeeper’s voice grew louder and louder until it was a crashing boom that caused everything to shake violently, and even caused the water of the Underworld River to vibrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless souls began to tremble and shake, and then offer obeisance to the Underworld Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Hao was shaken, but it was without the slightest hesitation that he said, “The word \u003cem\u003ebetray\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t exist for Bai Hao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were spoken with the utmost solemnity and honesty. In his world, nothing was more important than his Master Bai Xiaochun, who was his only family!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he wasn’t offended or worried at all by what the gravekeeper had said. In fact, it conformed perfectly with how he felt. And his answer could not have been more forthright!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker of praise passed through the gravekeeper’s eyes. This had been his final test of the Bai Hao. The position of Hell-Emperor was too important, and he had to ensure that he didn’t make any mistakes. As of this point, he was convinced that Bai Xiaochun had made the right choice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next month… you will be the Hell-Emperor!” With that, he waved his finger at Bai Hao, sending his legacy and his divine abilities into him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, outside of the Underworld Palace, countless magical symbols could be seen, flickering brightly until they transformed into a huge vortex. The spinning of that vortex indicated… that the passing of the legacy had begun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Hell-Emperor’s legacy began to be passed on, Bai Xiaochun was in his immortal\u0027s cave in the Underworld River Restricted Area, absorbing the life force from the Celestial’s blood-hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Undying Codex was divided into Skin, Muscle, Tendons, Bones, and Blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun had started from the foundation and worked all the way up to the fourth volume. And right now, he was in the Powered Bones level. After that came Heavenly Bones, and in the end, the true Undying Bones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to cultivating his Undying Technique was life force. Only by having access to enough life force could one achieve the meteoric rise that one sought!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, he had relied on his Eternal Parasol to absorb life force from the Wildlander chosen. That was what had helped him to break through from the Tempered Bones level to Powered Bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now… with the life force that the Celestial had gone through countless trials and tribulations to cultivate into his blood-hair, Bai Xiaochun was making shocking progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense rumbling sounds could be heard, and he shook physically as his bones creaked and cracked. It was as if he were completely changing his skeleton, causing him to rise rapidly through the fourth volume of the Undying Codex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he immediately broke through to the Heavenly Bones level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe became like a black hole, absorbing all of the life force from the blood-hair, and then using the Undying Codex techniques to send it rushing into his bones, utterly transforming them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one outside could hear any of the shocking sound, but Bai Xiaochun could hear it as clear as day. Furthermore, he could sense his Heavenly Bones rapidly absorbing the life force that continued to pour into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Heavenly Bones instantly went into the third stratum, then the fourth, fifth, seventh… and ninth!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was skyrocketing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother breakthrough!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was now in the first stratum of the Undying Bones, and yet, had only absorbed a portion of the life force from the Celestial’s blood-hair. Now, that life force continued to propel him through the Undying Bones level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final level of the Undying Bones required a massive amount of life force, more than all three of the previous levels put together. Furthermore, once he reached the peak… it meant that his fleshly body would be at an astonishingly high level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fleshly body would be comparable to a deva! His skin, muscles, and bones… would be at a level that would make them almost impossible to destroy!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on would come the Undying Blood, which came with dramatic restorative powers. At that point, his fleshly body would be very close to the truly undying level…. Then, he would be at the same level as the Blood Ancestor back in the River-Defying Sect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point… his cultivation of the Undying Codex would be complete!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, he relied on the blood-hair of the Celestial to advance by leaps and bounds. His Undying Bones advanced from the first stratum to the fourth, and then continued!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifth stratum, sixth, seventh….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-843\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-845\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-844","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
