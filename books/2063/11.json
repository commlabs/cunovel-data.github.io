Lissa was thinking about that as she sat in her first-period English class the next morning. They\u0027d stayed up late last night, sneaking out past curfew. The memory brought a smile to Lissa\u0027s face, even as she stifled a yawn. I couldn\u0027t help but feel a tiny bit of jealousy. I knew Avery was responsible for Lissa\u0027s happiness, and that bothered me on a petty level. Yet... Avery\u0027s new friendship was also making me feel less guilty about leaving Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa yawned again. It was hard to concentrate on The Scarlet Letter while fighting a slight hangover. Avery seemed to have a never-ending supply of liquor. Adrian had taken to this right away, but Lissa had been a little more hesitant. She\u0027d abandoned her partying days a long time ago, but she\u0027d finally succumbed last night and drunk more glasses of wine than she really should have. It wasn\u0027t unlike my situation with the vodka, ironically enough. Both of us overindulging, despite being miles and miles apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a high-pitched wail pierced the air. Lissa\u0027s head shot up, along with everyone else\u0027s in the class. In a corner of the room, a small fire alarm flashed and shrieked its warning. Naturally, some students started cheering while some pretended to be scared. The rest just looked surprised and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa\u0027s instructor also looked a little caught off guard, and after a quick examination, Lissa decided this wasn\u0027t a planned alarm. Teachers usually had a heads-up when there were drills, and Ms. Malloy didn\u0027t wear the usual weary expression teachers had when trying to figure out how much time the drill would cut from their lessons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up and at \u0027em,\" said Ms. Malloy in annoyance, grabbing a clipboard. \"You know where to go.\" Fire drill procedure was pretty standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa followed the others and fell in step with Christian. \"Did you set this up?\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Wish I had, though. This class is killing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You? I have the worst headache ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a knowing grin. \"Let that be a lesson to you, Little Miss Lush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face in return and gave him a light punch. They reached their class\u0027s meeting spot out on the quad and joined in the semblance of a line the others were trying to form. Ms. Malloy arrived and checked everyone off on her clipboard, satisfied no one had been left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think this was planned,\" said Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" said Christian. \"Which means even if there\u0027s no fire, it might take a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then. No use waiting around, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian and Lissa turned around in surprise at the voice behind them and saw Avery. She wore a purple sweater dress and black heels that seemed totally out of place on the wet grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" asked Lissa. \"Figured you\u0027d be in your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. It\u0027s so boring there. I had to come liberate you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did this?\" asked Christian, slightly impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery shrugged. \"I told you, I was bored. Now, come on while it\u0027s still chaotic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian and Lissa exchanged glances. \"Well,\" said Lissa slowly, \"I suppose they did already take attendance...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry!\" said Avery. Her excitement was contagious, and, feeling bold, Lissa hurried after her, Christian in tow. With all the milling students, no one noticed them cutting across the campus-until they reached the outside of guest housing. Simon stood leaning against the door, and Lissa stiffened. They were busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything set?\" Avery asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon, definitely the strong-and-silent type, gave a swift nod as his only answer before straightening up. He stuffed his hands into his coat pockets and walked off. Lissa stared in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just... he just let us go? And is he in on it?\" Simon wasn\u0027t on campus as a teacher, but still... that didn\u0027t necessarily mean he\u0027d let students skip out on class because of a faked fire drill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery grinned mischievously, watching him go. \"We\u0027ve been together for a while. He\u0027s got better things to do than babysit us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led them inside, but instead of going to her room, they cut off to a different section of the building and went somewhere I knew well: Adrian\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery beat on the door. \"Hey, Ivashkov! Open up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa slapped a hand over her mouth to smother her giggles. \"So much for stealth. Everyone\u0027s going to hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need him to hear me,\" Avery argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept pounding on the door and yelling, and finally, Adrian answered. His hair stuck up at odd angles, and he had dark circles under his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d drunk twice as much as Lissa last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What...?\" He blinked. \"Shouldn\u0027t you guys be in class? Oh God. I didn\u0027t sleep that much, did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us in,\" said Avery, pushing past. \"We\u0027ve got refugees from a fire here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flounced onto his couch, making herself at home while he continued staring. Lissa and Christian joined her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avery sprang the fire alarm,\" explained Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice work,\" said Adrian, collapsing into a fluffy chair. \"But why\u0027d you have to come here? Is this the only place that\u0027s not burning down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery batted her eyelashes at him. \"Aren\u0027t you happy to see us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eyed her speculatively for a moment. \"Always happy to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa was normally pretty straitlaced about this kind of thing, but something about it amused her. It was so wild, so silly... it was a break from all her recent worries. \"It\u0027s not going to take them that long to figure it out, you know. They could be letting everyone in right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They could be,\" agreed Avery, putting her feet up on the coffee table. \"But I have it on good authority that another alarm is going to go off in the school once they open the doors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell did you manage that?\" asked Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Top secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian rubbed his eyes and was clearly amused by this, despite the abrupt wake-up. \"You can\u0027t pull fire alarms all day, Lazar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I have it on good authority that once they give the all-clear on a second alarm, a third\u0027s going to go off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa laughed out loud, though a lot of it was due more to the guys\u0027 reactions and less to Avery\u0027s announcement. Christian, in fits of antisocial rebellion, had set people on fire. Adrian spent most of his days drunk and chain-smoking. For a cute society girl like Avery to astonish them, something truly remarkable had to happen. Avery looked very pleased at having outdone them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the interrogation\u0027s over now,\" she said, \"aren\u0027t you going to offer your guests any refreshments?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian stood up and yawned. \"Fine, fine, you insolent girl. I\u0027ll make coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a kick?\" She inclined her head toward Adrian\u0027s liquor cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have got to be kidding,\" said Christian. \"Do you even have a liver left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery wandered over to the cabinet and picked up a bottle of something. She held it out to Lissa. \"You game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Lissa\u0027s morning rebelliousness had limits. The wine headache still throbbed in her skull. \"Ugh, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cowards,\" said Avery. She turned back to Adrian. \"Well then, Mr. Ivashkov, you\u0027d best put on the pot. I always like a little coffee with my brandy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long after that, I faded away from Lissa\u0027s head and drifted back into my own, returning to the blackness of sleep and ordinary dreams. It was short-lived, however, seeing as a loud pounding soon jerked me into consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flew open, and a deep, searing pain shot through the back of my skull-the aftereffects of that toxic vodka, no doubt. Lissa\u0027s hangover had nothing on mine. I started to close my eyes, wanting to sink back under and let sleep heal the worst of my pain. Then, I heard the pounding again -and worse, my whole bed shook violently. Someone was kicking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my eyes again, I turned and found myself staring into Yeva\u0027s shrewd dark eyes. If Sydney had met many dhampirs like Yeva, I could understand why she thought our race were minions of hell. Pursing her lips, Yeva kicked the bed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I cried. \"I\u0027m awake, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeva muttered something in Russian, and Paul peered around from behind her, translating. \"She says you\u0027re not awake until you\u0027re actually out of bed and standing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with no more warning, that sadistic old woman continued kicking the bed. I jerked upright, and the world spun around me. I\u0027d said this before, but this time, I really meant it: I was never going to drink again. No good ever came from it. The covers looked awfully tempting to my agonized body, but a few more kicks from Yeva\u0027s pointy-toed boots made me shoot up off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay. Are you happy now? I\u0027m up.\" Yeva\u0027s expression didn\u0027t change, but at least she stopped with the kicking. I turned to Paul. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandmother says you have to go with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says you don\u0027t need to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to say that I wasn\u0027t following that crazy old wench anywhere, but after one look at her scary face, I thought better of it. I didn\u0027t put it past her to be able to turn people into toads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be ready to go once I shower and change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul translated my words, but Yeva shook her head and spoke again. \"She says there\u0027s no time,\" he explained. \"We have to go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I at least brush my teeth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe allowed that small concession, but a change of clothes was apparently out of the question. It was just as well. Each step I took made me feel woozy, and I probably would have passed out doing something as complicated as dressing and undressing. The clothes didn\u0027t smell or anything either; they were mostly just wrinkled from where I\u0027d fallen asleep in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got downstairs, I saw that no one else was awake except Olena. She was washing leftover dishes from last night and seemed surprised to see me up. That made two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s early for you, isn\u0027t it?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and caught sight of the kitchen clock. I gasped. It was only about four hours after I\u0027d gone to bed. \"Good God. Is the sun even up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, it was. Olena offered to make me breakfast, but again, Yeva reiterated our time crunch. My stomach seemed to simultaneously want and loathe food, so I couldn\u0027t say if abstaining was a good thing or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s just go and get this over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeva walked into the living room and returned a few moments later with a large satchel. She handed it to me expectantly. I shrugged and took it, hanging it over one shoulder. It clearly had stuff in it, but it wasn\u0027t that heavy. She went back out to the other room and returned with another tote bag. I took this one too and hung it over the same shoulder, balancing both of them. This one was heavier, but my back didn\u0027t complain too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she left for a third time and returned with a giant box, I started to get irate. \"What is this?\" I demanded, taking it from her. It felt like it had bricks in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandmother needs you to carry some things,\" Paul told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"I sort of figured that out fifty pounds ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeva gave me one more box, stacking it on top of the other. It wasn\u0027t as heavy, but by this point, it honestly didn\u0027t matter. Olena shot me a sympathetic look, shook her head, and returned silently to her dishes, apparently not about to argue with Yeva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeva set off after that, and I followed obediently, trying to both hold the boxes and not let the bags fall off my shoulder. It was a heavy load, one my hungover body really didn\u0027t want, but I was strong enough that I figured it wouldn\u0027t be a problem to get into town or wherever she was leading me. Paul ran along at my side, apparently there to let me know if Yeva found anything along the road she wanted me to carry too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like spring was charging into Siberia far faster than it ever did into Montana. The sky was clear, and the morning sun was heating things up surprisingly fast. It was hardly summer weather, but it was definitely enough to notice. It would have made very uncomfortable walking weather for a Moroi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where we\u0027re going?\" I asked Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor someone so old, Yeva could move at a pretty good pace, and I found myself having to hurry to keep up with her with my load. At one point, she glanced back and said something that Paul translated as, \"She\u0027s kind of surprised that you can\u0027t move faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I\u0027m kind of surprised that no one else can carry any of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe translated again: \"She says if you\u0027re really such a famous Strigoi killer, then this shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was filled with great relief when downtown came into sight... only we kept walking past it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" I said. \"Where the hell are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout giving me a backward glance, Yeva rattled off something. \"Grandmother says Uncle Dimka never would have complained so much,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this was Paul\u0027s fault; he was just the messenger. Yet, every time he spoke, I kind of wanted to kick him. Nonetheless, I kept carrying my burden and didn\u0027t say anything else for the rest of the walk. Yeva was right to a certain extent. I was a Strigoi hunter, and it was true that Dimitri would have never complained about some old lady\u0027s crazy whims. He would have done his duty patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to summon him up in my mind and draw strength from him. I thought about that time in the cabin again, thought about the way his lips had felt on mine and the wonderful scent of his skin when I\u0027d pressed closer to him. I could hear his voice once more, murmuring in my ear that he loved me, that I was beautiful, that I was the only one... Thinking of him didn\u0027t take away the discomfort of my journey with Yeva, but it made it a little more bearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked for almost an hour more before reaching a small house, and I was ready to fall over in relief, soaked in sweat. The house was one floor, made of plain, weatherworn brown boards. The windows, however, were surrounded on three sides by exquisite, highly stylized blue shutters overlaid with a white design. It was that same sort of flashy use of color I\u0027d seen on the buildings in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Yeva knocked on the door. At first there was only silence, and I panicked, thinking we\u0027d have to turn right around and head back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, a woman answered the door-a Moroi woman. She was maybe thirty, very pretty, with high cheekbones and strawberry-blond hair. She exclaimed in surprise at seeing Yeva, smiling and greeting her in Russian. Glancing over at Paul and me, the woman quickly stepped aside and gestured us in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe switched to English as soon as she realized I was American. All these bilingual people were kind of amazing. It wasn\u0027t something I saw very often in the U.S. She pointed to a table and told me to set everything there, which I did with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Oksana,\" she said, shaking my hand. \"My husband, Mark, is in the garden and should be in soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Rose,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOksana offered us chairs. Mine was wooden and straight-backed, but at that moment, it felt like a down-filled bed. I sighed happily and wiped the sweat off my brow. Meanwhile, Oksana unpacked the things I\u0027d carried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bags were filled with leftovers from the funeral. The top box contained some dishes and pots, which Paul explained had been borrowed from Oksana some time ago. Oksana finally reached the bottom box, and so help me, it was filled with garden bricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have got to be kidding,\" I said. Across the living room, Yeva looked very smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOksana was delighted by the gifts. \"Oh, Mark will be happy to have these.\" She smiled at me. \"It was very sweet of you to carry these that whole way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy to help,\" I said stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back door opened, and a man walked in-Mark, presumably. He was tall and stockily built, his graying hair indicating an age greater than Oksana\u0027s. He washed his hands in the kitchen sink and then turned to join us. I nearly gasped when I saw his face and discovered something stranger than the age difference. He was a dhampir. For a moment, I wondered if this was someone else and not her husband, Mark. But that was the name Oksana introduced him with, and the truth hit me: a Moroi and dhampir married couple. Sure, our two races hooked up all the time. But marriage? It was very scandalous in the Moroi world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep the surprise off my face and behave as politely as I could. Oksana and Mark seemed very interested in me, though she did most of the talking. Mark simply watched, curiosity all over his face. My hair was down, so my tattoos couldn\u0027t have given away my unpromised status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he was just wondering how an American girl had found her way out to the middle of nowhere. Maybe he thought I was a new blood whore recruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy my third glass of water, I began to feel better. It was around that time that Oksana said we should eat, and by then, my stomach was ready for it. Oksana and Mark prepared the food together, dismissing any offers of help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the couple work was fascinating. I had never seen such an efficient team. They never got in each other\u0027s way and never needed to talk about what needed doing next. They just knew. Despite the remote location, the kitchen\u0027s contents were modern, and Oksana placed a dish of some sort of potato casserole in the microwave. Mark\u0027s back was to her while he rummaged in the refrigerator, but as soon as she hit start, he said, \"No, it doesn\u0027t need to be that long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked in surprise, glancing back and forth between them. He hadn\u0027t even seen what time she\u0027d selected. Then I got it. \"You\u0027re bonded,\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth looked at me in equal surprise. \"Yes. Didn\u0027t Yeva tell you?\" Oksana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot a quick look at Yeva, who was again wearing that annoyingly self-satisfied look on her face. \"No. Yeva hasn\u0027t been very forthcoming this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most everyone around here knows,\" Oksana said, returning to her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then... then you\u0027re a spirit user.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made her pause again. She and Mark exchanged startled looks. \"That,\" she said, \"is not something that\u0027s widely known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most people think you haven\u0027t specialized, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was exactly how it had been for Lissa and me. Stories of bonds had always existed in Moroi folklore, but how bonds formed had always been a mystery. It was generally believed they \"just happened.\" Like Oksana, Lissa had generally been regarded as a non-specializing Moroi-one who didn\u0027t have any special ability with one element. We realized now, of course, that bonding only occurred with spirit users, when they saved the lives of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in Oksana\u0027s voice told me she wasn\u0027t really all that surprised I knew. I couldn\u0027t figure out how she\u0027d realized that, however, and I was too stunned by my discovery to say anything else. Lissa and I had never, ever met another bonded pair. The only such two we knew about were the legendary Vladimir and Anna. And those stories were shrouded by centuries of incomplete history, making it difficult to know fact from fiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other leads we had to the world of spirit were Ms. Karp-a former teacher who went insane-and Adrian. Until now, he had been our biggest discovery, a spirit user who was more or less stable-depending on how you looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the meal was ready, spirit never came up. Oksana led the conversation, keeping to light topics and jumping between languages. I studied her and Mark as I ate, looking for any signs of instability. I saw none. They seemed like perfectly pleasant, perfectly ordinary people. If I hadn\u0027t known what I did, I would have had no reason to suspect anything. Oksana didn\u0027t seem depressed or unhinged. Mark hadn\u0027t inherited that vile darkness that sometimes seeped into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach welcomed the food, and the last of my headache faded away. At one point, though, a strange sensation swept through me. It was disorienting, like a fluttering in my head, and a wave of heat and then ice coursing through me. The feeling disappeared as quickly as it came on, and I hoped it\u0027d be the last of that demon vodka\u0027s ill effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished eating, and I jumped up to help. Oksana shook her head. \"No, there\u0027s no need. You should go with Mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dabbed at his face with a napkin and then stood up. \"Yes. Let\u0027s go out to the garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to follow, then paused to glance back at Yeva. I expected her to chastise me for abandoning the dishes. Instead, I found no smug or disapproving looks. Her expression was... knowing. Almost expectant. Something about it sent a shiver down my back, and I recalled Viktoria\u0027s words: Yeva had dreamed of my arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garden Mark led me to was much bigger than I expected, enclosed in a thick fence and lined with trees. New leaves hung on them, blocking the worst of the heat. Lots of bushes and flowers were already in bloom, and here and there, young shoots were well on their way to adulthood. It was beautiful, and I wondered if Oksana had had a hand in it. Lissa was able to make plants grow with spirit. Mark gestured me over to a stone bench. We sat down side by side, and silence fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said. \"What would you like to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. You don\u0027t waste time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see any point in it. You must have lots of questions. I\u0027ll do my best to answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\" I asked. \"That I\u0027m shadow-kissed too. You did, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Yeva told us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that was a surprise. \"Yeva?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can sense things... things the rest of us can\u0027t. She doesn\u0027t always know what she\u0027s sensing, however. She only knew there was a strange feel to you, and she\u0027d only ever felt that around one other person. So she brought you to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like she could have done that without me having to carry a household\u0027s worth of stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis made him laugh. \"Don\u0027t take it personally. She was testing you. She wanted to see if you\u0027re a worthy match for her grandson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the point? He\u0027s dead now.\" I nearly choked on the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but for her, it\u0027s still important. And, by the way, she does think you\u0027re worthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has a funny way of showing it. I mean, aside from bringing me to meet you, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again. \"Even without her, Oksana would have known what you are as soon as she met you. Being shadow-kissed has an effect on the aura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she can see auras too,\" I murmured. \"What else can she do? She must be able to heal, or you wouldn\u0027t be shadow-kissed. Does she have super-compulsion? Can she walk dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat caught him off guard. \"Her compulsion is strong, yes... but what do you mean, walk dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like... she\u0027d be able to enter someone else\u0027s mind when they\u0027re asleep. Anyone\u0027s mind-not just yours. Then they could have conversations, just as if they were together. My friend can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s expression told me that was news to him. \"Your friend? Your bondmate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBondmate? I\u0027d never heard that term. It was weird-sounding, but it made sense. \"No... another spirit user.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another? How many do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three, technically. Well, four now, counting Oksana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark turned away, staring absentmindedly at a cluster of pink flowers. \"That many... that\u0027s incredible. I\u0027ve only met one other spirit user, and that was years ago. He too was bonded to his guardian. That guardian died, and it ripped him apart. He still helped us when Oksana and I were trying to figure things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself for my own death all the time, and I feared for Lissa\u0027s. Yet it had never occurred to me just what it would be like with a bond. How would it affect the other person? What would it be like to have a gaping hole, where once you\u0027d been intimately linked to someone else? \"He never mentioned walking dreams either,\" Mark continued. He chuckled again, friendly lines crinkling up around his blue eyes. \"I thought I would be helping you, but maybe you\u0027re here to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said doubtfully. \"I think you guys have more experience at this than we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your bondmate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back in the U.S.\" I didn\u0027t have to elaborate, but somehow, I needed to tell him the whole truth. \"I... I left her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Left as in... you simply traveled? Or left as in you abandoned her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbandoned. The word was like a slap in the face, and suddenly, all I could envision was that last day I\u0027d seen her, when I\u0027d left her crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had things to do,\" I said evasively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know. Oksana told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told you what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he hesitated. \"She shouldn\u0027t have done it... She tries not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done what?\" I exclaimed, uneasy for reasons I couldn\u0027t explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She, well... she brushed your mind. During brunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought back and suddenly recalled the tickling in my head, the heat rolling over me. \"What does that mean exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An aura can tell a spirit user about someone\u0027s personality. But Oksana can also dig further, reaching in and actually reading more specific information about a person. Sometimes she can tie that ability into compulsion... but the results are very, very powerful. And wrong. It\u0027s not right to do that to someone you have no bond with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to process that. Neither Lissa nor Adrian could read the thoughts of others. The closest Adrian could come to someone\u0027s mind was the dream walking. Lissa couldn\u0027t do that, not even for me. I could feel her, but the opposite wasn\u0027t true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oksana could feel... oh, I don\u0027t know how to explain it. There\u0027s a recklessness in you. You\u0027re on some sort of quest. There\u0027s vengeance written all over your soul.\" He suddenly reached over and lifted my hair up, peering at my neck. \"Just as I thought. You\u0027re unpromised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my head back. \"Why is that such a big deal? That whole town back there is filled with dhampirs who aren\u0027t guardians.\" I still thought Mark was a nice guy, but being preached to always irritated me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but they\u0027ve chosen to settle down. You... and others like you... you become vigilantes of sorts. You\u0027re obsessed with hunting Strigoi on your own, with personally setting out to right the wrongs that whole race has brought down upon us. That can only lead to trouble. I see it all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the time?\" I asked, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think guardian numbers are dwindling? They\u0027re leaving to have homes and families. Or they\u0027re going off like you, still fighting but answering to no one-unless they\u0027re hired to be bodyguards or Strigoi hunters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dhampirs for hire...\" I suddenly began to understand how a non-royal like Abe had gotten his bodyguards. Money could make anything happen, I supposed. \"I\u0027ve never heard of anything like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. You think the Moroi and other guardians want that widely known? Want to dangle that in front of you as an option?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see what\u0027s so wrong with Strigoi hunting. We\u0027re always defensive, not offensive, when it comes to Strigoi. Maybe if more dhampirs set out after them, they wouldn\u0027t be such a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, but there are different ways of going about that, some better than others. And when you\u0027re going out like you are-with a heart filled with sorrow and revenge? That\u0027s not one of the better ways. It\u0027ll make you sloppy. And the shadow-kissed darkness will just complicate things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed my arms over my chest and stared stonily ahead. \"Yeah, well, it\u0027s not like I can do much about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to me, expression surprised once more. \"Why don\u0027t you just have your bondmate heal the darkness out of you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-11.html","bookId":2063,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:04 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:04 AM"}
