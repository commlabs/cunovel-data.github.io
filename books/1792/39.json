When he informed her that the Marquess was upstairs and wished an audience with her, she gave him a disgruntled look before giving in to his request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she walked into the bedroom, she came to a sudden stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close the door, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina did as he asked, but only because she wished privacy for their confrontation. \"Did you enjoy your ride?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mildness in his tone confused her. Christina was ready for a fight. Lyon didn\u0027t seem to be in an accommodating mood. \"Lyon,\" she began, deliberately avoiding his gaze, \"I don\u0027t think you realize what I\u0027ve done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do, my dear,\" Lyon answered, in such a cheerful voice that Christina was more confused than ever. \"You\u0027re going to have to start all over. You\u0027ll have to court me, though now that you are aware of my… unusual upbringing, I doubt you\u0027ll—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina looked at him. \"All right? That is all you have to say to me?\" She shook her head, let out a long sigh, and then whispered, \"You don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. You\u0027ve just cast me aside. Elbert explained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t upset?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why not? You told me you loved me,\" Christina said. She moved a step closer to Lyon. \"Your words were false, weren\u0027t they? Now that you know—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t false,\" Lyon answered. He leaned back and closed his eyes. \"God, this feels good. I tell you, Christina, the ride from London gets longer every time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe his casual attitude. Christina felt like weeping. \"You cannot humiliate me and then act as though nothing has happened. A warrior would kill another for such an offense,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, but you aren\u0027t a warrior, Christina. You\u0027re my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even open his eyes to look at her when he asked,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what did I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know?\" She had to take a deep breath before she could go on. \"You shouted at me in front of a witness. You shamed me. You disgraced me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was the witness?\" Lyon asked, in such a soft voice that she had to move a bit closer to hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryan,\" Christina announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I yell at you in front of Richards, too? I seem to remember—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were shouting because I fainted. You weren\u0027t angry with me. Surely you can see the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do now,\" Lyon admitted. \"Do you wonder why I shouted at you in front of Bryan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon opened his eyes. His irritation was obvious. \"You scared the hell out of me,\" he announced. Each word was clipped, hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so surprised, Christina. When I walked inside that tavern and found you sitting so peacefully in the midst of the worse scum in England, my mind could barely take it in. Then you had the gall to smile at me, as if you were happy to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to stop talking. The memory was making him angry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was happy to see you. Did you doubt that I was?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands rested on her hips. She tossed her hair over her shoulder and continued to frown at him. \"Well?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you cut your hair again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. It is all part of the ritual of mourning,\" Christina announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, if you cut your hair every time you\u0027re unhappy with me, you\u0027ll be bald in a month\u0027s time. I promise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon drew a long breath, then said, \"Let me get this straight inside my mind. I\u0027m never to raise my voice to you in future? Christina, it won\u0027t work. There will be times when I shout at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if you raise your voice to me,\" Christina muttered. \"I shall also let my temper show on occasion.\" she admitted. \"But I would never, ever let an outsider see my displeasure. That was the humiliation, Lyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Then I should have dragged you into the back room to shout at you in privacy?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you should have,\" Christina agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took a foolish risk, Christina. You were in danger, whether you realized it or not. I want your apology and your promise never to take such a risk again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall have to think about it,\" she said. Now that she was forced to consider what he was saying to her, she realized she had been in a bit of danger. There were too many men in Bryan\u0027s tavern for her to subdue… if they\u0027d all decided to challenge her at the same time. She\u0027d thought she\u0027d gained the upper hand, though, after the single challenger had backed down… and after she\u0027d mentioned her husband was the Marquess of Lyonwood. \"Yes,\" she repeated, \"I shall have to think about these promises you want from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell from Lyon\u0027s ferocious expression that he didn\u0027t care for her honest answer. \"I warned you that it wouldn\u0027t be easy for you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what this is really all about, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just said—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re testing me, aren\u0027t you, Christina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made the mistake of getting too close to the tub, realizing her error a second too late. Lyon grabbed her and pulled her down into his lap. Water sloshed over the sides of the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve ruined my gown,\" Christina gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve ruined others,\" Lyon told her when she quit struggling. He cupped the sides of her face and made her look at him. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes filled with tears. \"You humiliated me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" Lyon repeated in a harsh whisper. \"I\u0027m sorry you felt humiliated,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single tear slid down her cheek. Lyon wiped it away with his thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I frightened you,\" she whispered. \"I shall try not to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me you love me,\" Lyon demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I believe you?\" he asked. His voice was husky, coaxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Christina answered. She tried to push his hands away when she realized he was actually insulting her. \"Of course you should believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t believe me when I tell you I love you,\" Lyon said. \"You have it in your head that it\u0027s only a temporary condition, don\u0027t you?\" He kissed her slowly, tenderly, hoping to take the sting out of his gentle rebuke. \"When you learn to trust me completely, you\u0027ll know I won\u0027t change my mind. My love is forever, Christina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon didn\u0027t give her time to argue over that fact. He kissed her again. His tongue flicked over her soft lips until they parted for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he began to ravage her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina tried to protest. \"Lyon, I must—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get your clothes off,\" Lyon interrupted. He was already pulling apart the fastenings on the back of her gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she hadn\u0027t meant to say that. But her thoughts got confused inside her mind. Lyon had pulled her gown down to her waist. His hands cupped her br**sts, his thumbs rubbed her ni**les, forced her response. His mouth had never seemed so warm, so inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more water on the floor than in the tub. Lyon didn\u0027t seem to mind. He was determined, and he had Christina stripped out of her soggy clothes in little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina didn\u0027t want to struggle. She put her arms around his neck and let out a soft sigh. \"The water isn\u0027t very hot,\" she whispered against his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon? I want—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, inside you,\" Lyon whispered. His mouth feasted on the side of her neck. His warm breath sent shivers down her spine. \"You want to feel me inside you,\" he rasped out. \"Hard. Hot. I\u0027ll try to go slow, but you\u0027ll want me harder, faster, until I\u0027m touching your womb and you\u0027re begging me for release.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina\u0027s head fell back so that Lyon could kiss more of her throat. His dark promise of what was to come made her throat tighten and her heartbeat quicken. \"I\u0027ll stay inside you until I\u0027m hard again, won\u0027t I, Christina? And then I\u0027ll pleasure you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth settled on hers for another long, drugging kiss. \"That\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it, my sweet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Christina answered. She sighed against his mouth. \"It\u0027s what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then marry me. Now,\" Lyon demanded. He kissed her again as a precaution against any protest. \"Hurry, Christina. I want to… Christina, don\u0027t move like that,\" Lyon ground out. \"It\u0027s torture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered the truth against his shoulder, then nipped his skin with her teeth, her nails. She moved again to straddle his hips, rubbing her br**sts against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet when she tried to take Lyon inside her, he wouldn\u0027t allow it. His hands settled on the sides of her hips, holding her away from his arousal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, Christina,\" he groaned. \"Are we still divorced inside your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon, please,\" Christina begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew her up against him until her heat rested on the flat of his stomach. His fingers found her, slowly penetrated her. \"Do you want me to stop?\" he asked with a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina gave in. \"Yes, Lyon. You were supposed to court me first.\" She moaned when he increased the pressure. She bit his bottom lip, then opened her mouth for him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Compromise,\" Lyon whispered as he slowly pushed her downward and began to penetrate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t understand what he was saying to her, thought to at least try to question him, but Lyon suddenly shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis movement was forceful, deliberate. Christina couldn\u0027t speak, couldn\u0027t think. Lyon was pulling her into the sun. Soon, when she could bear the scorching heat no longer, he would give her sweet release. Christina clung to her warrior in blissful surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have gone downstairs for dinner. I don\u0027t want your mother to think she can hide in her bedroom. She must eat all her meals with us in future, husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon ignored his wife\u0027s comments. He pulled her up against his side, draped the bed covers over her legs when he noticed she was trembling, then began to tickle her shoulder with his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina? Didn\u0027t your father ever yell at you when you were a little girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and rested her chin on his chest before she answered him. \"That\u0027s an odd question to put to me. Yes, Father did yell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But never in front of others?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there was one time when he lost his temper,\" she admitted. \"I was too little to remember the incident, but my mother and the shaman liked to tell the story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our holy man,\" Christina explained. \"Like the one who married us. My shaman doesn\u0027t ever wear a cone on his head, though.\" She ended her comment with a dainty shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was the reason for your father to lose his temper?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll not laugh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina turned her gaze to stare at his chest so that his golden eyes wouldn\u0027t break her concentration. \"My brother carried home a beautiful snake. Father was very pleased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a fine snake, Lyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear the smile in his voice but didn\u0027t take exception. \"Mother was also pleased. I must have watched the way my brother held his prize, and the shaman said I was envious of the attention given my brother, too, for I went out to capture a snake of my own. No one could find me for several hours. I was very little and in constant mischief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, so that is why your father lost his temper,\" Lyon announced. \"Your disappearance must have—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that isn\u0027t the reason,\" Christina interjected. \"Though of course he was unhappy that I\u0027d left the safety of the village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then?\" Lyon prodded when she didn\u0027t immediately continue with her story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone was frantically searching for me when I strutted back into the village. Mama said I always strutted because I tried to imitate my brother\u0027s swagger. White Eagle walked like a proud warrior, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of the story she\u0027d heard so many times during her growing years made her smile. \"And did you have a snake with you when you strutted back into the village?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" she answered. \"The shaman recounted that I held it just as my brother had held his snake. Father was standing on the far side of the fires. Mother stood beside him. Neither showed any outward reaction to my prize. They didn\u0027t want to frighten me into dropping the snake, I was told later. Anyway,\" she added with a sigh, \"Father walked over to me. He took the snake out of my hand, killed it, and then began to shout at me. Mother knew I didn\u0027t understand. Father had praised my brother, you see, yet he was yelling at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think that was?\" Lyon asked, already dreading her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother\u0027s snake wasn\u0027t poisonous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tremble in her husband\u0027s voice made her laugh. \"Father was soon over his anger. The shaman announced that the spirits had protected me. I was their lioness, you see. Mama said Father was also sorry for making me cry. He took me riding with him that afternoon and let me sit on his lap during the evening meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parallel was too good to pass up. \"Your father was frightened,\" Lyon announced. \"He loved you, Christina—so much so that when he saw the danger you were in, his discipline deserted him. Just like my discipline deserted me when I saw the danger you were in yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged her up on top of him so he could look into her eyes. \"It was his duty to keep my lioness safe for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina slowly nodded. \"I think you would like my father. You\u0027re very like him in many ways. You\u0027re just as arrogant. Oh, don\u0027t frown, Lyon. I give you a compliment when I say you\u0027re arrogant. You\u0027re full of bluster, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded too sincere for Lyon to take insult. \"What is your father\u0027s name?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black Wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he like me?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-39.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM"}
