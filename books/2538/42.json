If he felt anything like Bryn, he had to be at least slightly tipsy. Overcompensating, probably. “It’s not all fun and games in my business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a nauseating flashback, and suddenly she realized that she reeked of dead flesh; it had soaked into her clothes, her skin, her hair. The whole office stank with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFun and games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVioletta Sammons’s disconnected head rolling free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rasp of the saw vibrating in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vodka rushed up on her, and Bryn barely made it to her trash can before she threw up. Between the convulsions, she gasped for breath and sobbed, and McCallister came around the desk and silently handed her tissues, then helped her back into her chair as she covered her face and tried to muffle her wild, uncontrollable sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her hair, very softly. He didn’t say a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she was able to shut it off, just enough to gather her voice together. “I have to shower,” she said. Her voice was uneven and broken, but he nodded as he looked down at her. “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be,” he said. “I’ll be there after you’re done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed another set of clothes and went into the locker room at the end of the hall; Riley was in there, changing into jeans and a comfortable sweatshirt with her hair still clinging damply to her face. She looked up, surprised, as Bryn dumped her stuff on the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn didn’t want to talk, but she had to try. “Bad one,” she managed to say. “Major decomposition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley nodded and opened her locker. She tossed Bryn a bottle. “Try this,” she said. “Best I’ve found. Use it four times, you should be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn didn’t even wait to thank her. The urge to get clean was so overpowering that even after she was standing in the hot spray, soaping herself from head to toe, she couldn’t stop gasping and shaking from the pressure. Two passes with the shampoo and she still felt filthy. By the third she was calming down, and by the fourth she felt almost normal. Her skin tingled from the scrubbing, but that was a good thing; the greasy, horrible stench seemed to have finally rubbed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn threw her old clothes into the incineration biohazard bag and dressed in the clean ones, dried her hair, and was just finishing when there was a knock on the locker room door, and McCallister looked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked rough—pallid, with dark circles beneath his eyes. He’d stripped off his coat and tie and unfastened the top button of his shirt. “All right if I come in?” he asked, and she suddenly felt very selfish for taking up the shower for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all yours,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded thanks and opened a locker—Joe Fideli’s—and took out a pair of blue jeans and a clean white T-shirt. “We’re about the same size,” he said. “At least I won’t look like I’m going for gangster style.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed him Riley’s shampoo. “Four passes,” she said. “It works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, faintly, and said, “Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already stripping off his clothes before she closed the door, and in those fast, ruthless motions, she sensed that McCallister, too, was on the edge of losing control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him do it in private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in her office, Bryn turned on music, something soft and soothing, and nibbled some crackers to settle her still-restless stomach. Her skin and clothes smelled clean and fresh, but it was hard not to imagine the ghost of that stench still hanging around. She cleaned out the trash can, then used disinfectant spray around her chair and on her shoes. Probably too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she sat down and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft chime made her open them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had e-mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. She’d actually forgotten all about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting in her in-box was a new message from one of those throwaway account services, with the ominous moniker of deadman. There was no subject line, and the message was just an address and a time of day—ten p.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCallister came back, still glistening with drops from the shower, and saw from her expression that something was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe mutely spun her computer around and showed him. He leaned over the desk to read it. “Can your tech wizards trace that?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably not, but we’ll try it. That is the e-mail equivalent of a burner phone, and if he’s got any sense at all, he hid his IP address through a randomizer.” McCallister already had his cell out and was dialing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you need my account password?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Already have it,” he said, and got up to turn his back and talk to his resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProof, once again, that there was nothing secret in her life anymore. Nothing sacred. She’d expected to feel some sense of burning betrayal, but instead, she felt … tired. And, weirdly, a little reassured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCallister stayed on the phone a while longer, and she contemplated opening up another set of drinks, but that seemed less like a necessary safety valve and more like a crutch, at this point. Bryn shut and locked the drawer, and looked at the clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was coming up on six o‘clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hours to get the money and deliver it to the address—or else what? Lose their potential chance at the supplier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they did, Bryn had no doubt whatsoever that Irene Harte would pull the plug on the project, and her, with pleasure. It was that, as much as anything else, that made her step back from the comfort of the booze. I’m not giving you the excuse, she thought. Not you. You don’t get to kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wouldn’t be Harte, she realized. When it came to the end, it would come from the man pacing the floor on the other side of her office, talking quietly into his cell phone. He’d be the one told to withhold her drug, reduce her to that decayed, rotting shell. She’d be eaten alive. She’d beg for release until eventually the last of the nanites faded and died….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr until he dismembered her, out of sheer horrified mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. He promised. He promised me he wouldn’t let that happen. She closed her eyes and took deep breaths and tried to think of something, anything less painful. He’d promised, and he’d meant it. He wouldn’t let her linger on and rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCallister finished the call. “I have a car and driver coming, and I’m on the way to pick up the money,” he said. “Joe is five minutes out. Stay here, and he’ll take you home. I’ll come by here at eight thirty to pick you up for the rendezvous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?” he asked, and she held his eyes until she saw that he knew. “I meant what I said, Bryn. I won’t let that happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” she said. “Thank you.” She stood up and hugged him. It was an impulse, and she didn’t mean anything by it except gratitude, until she was in his arms, and then … then it was something else entirely. “Tell me you didn’t sleep with her,” she whispered, very quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t ask what she was talking about. “I didn’t,” he said, and something brushed her forehead, very gently. It might have been a kiss. “Stay safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn arrived home at six thirty, feeling exhausted and not up for family drama of any kind. Luckily, she didn’t get any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment was spotlessly clean, Mr. French was happy to see her, and the air smelled like rich Italian food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, sweetie!” Annie said brightly from the kitchen. “Hope you’re hungry. I think I cooked enough pasta for the complex!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t do this. Bryn dropped onto the sofa and covered her face with her hands. In a few seconds, she felt Annie’s weight settle in next to her, and her sister’s arm went around her shoulders. She didn’t look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Annie said. “Hey, what did I say? You don’t like Italian anymore?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just …” For an extremely unsettling second, Bryn thought the dam might just collapse inside her. If she said anything, she’d say everything, everything that she’d promised to keep secret. And that would unburden her, but doom her sister. McCallister’s people were always listening, and someone was always listening to them. “It was a bad day. Really bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, honey. Hey, does it have anything to do with the hottie who was here with you before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Why would you even assume that?” Bryn looked at her sister finally. Annie cocked an eyebrow and shrugged. “It’s not all about my love life. Or lack of one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just saying, he’s hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about married did you not understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s married and married, in my expert opinion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Expert?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, I work in a bar. I am an expert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was … a good point. Bryn let it pass. “It’s not about Joe, and it had nothing to do with … It was work. Bad day at work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. So … it was disgusting, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I’d rather talk about your lack of a love life. Seriously, there isn’t anybody you’re interested in? Come on, Bryn. Humor me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody,” she said, but then she sighed and shook her head. “He doesn’t care about me. Not that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he male?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he straight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As far as I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then he cares, sweetie. You don’t have any idea how sexy you are, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn laughed, and it sounded a little wild, a little despairing. “I am so very far from sexy right now, Annie. And how did we get on this subject again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you wouldn’t discuss dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’ll discuss it now. I don’t have much time, though. I’m sorry, but I have to go out tonight. An appointment. I need to be there by eight thirty.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/working-stiff-revivalist-1/page-42.html","bookId":2538,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:32 PM"}
