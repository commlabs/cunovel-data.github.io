Nana had styled her shoulder-length brown hair into a loose bob that hid the paleness of her cheeks. She clutched a tissue in her shaky fist and continually dabbed at her watery eyes. She’d lost family, too, I reminded myself. I wasn’t the only one suffering. I should try to help her with her loss, should act the way she wanted me to act, but…I just couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to say a few words honoring the, uh, deceased?” Pops asked after clearing his throat. His graying hair had receded so much at the sides that he had a major widow’s peak. The rest was thinning and yes, he sported a cringe-worthy comb-over. How my mom had loved to tease him about that. “Ali?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t need to think about my reply. “No, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNana twisted to face me. Her eyelids were puffed, the skin underneath splotched with red and her makeup streaked. I had to look away. Those golden eyes were too familiar, the pain inside them too…reflective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” she asked. “I know your mother would have wanted—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure,” I rushed out. Just the thought of standing in front of everyone and sharing my favorite memories caused a cold sweat to break out on my skin. No way. Just no way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone gentled as she said, “This is your chance to say goodbye, Alice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGonna be sick. “Call me Ali. Please. And I…I can’t say goodbye.” I wasn’t ever going to say goodbye. Part of me still clung to the idea that there was a chance I’d wake up and discover all of this was simply a bad dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA weary sigh left her, and she returned her attention to the front. “All right. I don’t think what you’re doing is healthy, but all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I said, relief causing me to wilt against my seat belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the drive passed in silence, only the occasional sniffle to be heard. What I would have given for my iPod. I’d play Skillet or Red and pretend I was dancing with—myself. But I hadn’t gone home to pack my things. I hadn’t wanted to go home. Nana had done that for me, and technophobe that she was, she’d probably had no idea what that little Nano could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last we reached our destination and walked to the grave sites. There would be no church service. Everything was to be done here. Which wasn’t right. My mother had loved to go to church, and my dad had hated cemeteries, had died at the edge of one—of this one, to be morbidly specific—and they were going to bury him here? That was wrong on so many levels, and ticked me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have been cremated. But what did I know? I was just the daughter who’d helped kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the daylight—or what should have been daylight—I studied the place that had destroyed my life. The sky was dark and drizzly, as if the world wept for what it had lost. While I was right on board with that, my dad wouldn’t have approved. He’d loved the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hilly stretch of land was treed up just right, with a few bushes growing around some of the headstones and flowers of every color thriving in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day there would be bushes and flowers around my family’s headstones. Right now, there were just three big, empty holes, waiting for those closed caskets to drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again I found myself the recipient of too many I’m sorrys and you’ll be \u0026nbsp;okays. Screw them all. I retreated inside myself, tuning out everything that was spoken during the ceremony, simply looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople around me wept into their tissues. There was Mr. and Mrs. Flanagan, my former neighbors, and their son, Cary. He was a cute boy, a little older than me. I can’t remember how many times I’d thought that if I was a normal girl, with a normal life, I’d be sitting at my window, staring out at his house, imagining him closing the distance and asking me out on a date. Imagining we’d go to dinner, he’d walk me to my door, and kiss me. My first. Imagining he’d tell me that he didn’t care how crazy my family was, that he liked me no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never had. He never had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he cast me a sad smile, and I looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the pastor had finished, when my grandparents had said their piece, everyone stood and gathered in groups, talking, swapping stories. Too many of them congregated around me, patting my shoulders and giving me hugs. Actions I didn’t appreciate or return. I just didn’t have the strength to put on a dog-and-pony show so that I wouldn’t hurt anyone’s feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to be in my bed, buried under the covers, pretending I had my old life back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was such a happy child, wasn’t she?” said someone at my side. A woman I couldn’t quite place but knew I’d seen before was peering at the smallest casket, tears streaming down her red cheeks. “We’re going to miss her. I remember this one time…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn and on she talked. I stood there, suddenly unable to breathe. I opened my mouth to tell her to shut up, but the words wouldn’t form. I tried to walk away, but my feet were rooted in place, as if someone had poured concrete over my shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then there was the time, in class, when she helped…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud ringing sprouted in my ears and I couldn’t make out the individual words. Didn’t matter. I knew who she was talking about, and if she didn’t get out of my face, I was going to lose it. Already I was spiraling into an abyss, screaming silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…and the other girls utterly adored her…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArgh! Spiraling…spiraling out of control…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deserved this, I reminded myself. This was part of my “worse.” My words, my insistence, had killed my family, had put them in those boxes. Had I done anything differently, a single detail, they would still be alive. But I hadn’t, and so here I was. There they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…her talent, her spirit, were rare and glorious and I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abyss threw me one way, then the other, cutting me up bit by bit, destroying me. The woman had to shut up. She just had to. Shut. Up. My heart felt pinned against my ribs, warping the beat, and if she didn’t shut up I would die. I knew I would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…used to tell me she wanted to be just like you when she grew up. She admired you so much....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, shut up, shut up! But she kept talking and kept telling me all about my…sister....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…about Emma…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…Emma…gone…my lily…gone…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d promised to keep her safe. I’d failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream ripped from my throat, followed right on the heels of another and another. I lost track of everything around me, clutched my ears to stop from hearing the utter horror in my voice, and fell to my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not just to my knees. I fell down, down, down, the abyss, a never-ending pit of despair, still screaming, screaming, consumed by grief, flooded by sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands patted at me, but I didn’t calm. I screamed so loud and so long my voice eventually broke. I gagged and choked, tears pouring down my cheeks, pooling around me, a lake of misery. I cried so hard my entire body shook, and my eyes swelled shut. I couldn’t breathe, didn’t want to breathe anymore. Dying would have been a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what happened after that. For the second time in my life, I lost consciousness. Maybe I would never wake....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course, I awoke. In the days that followed, I tried to take comfort in the fact that the worst thing that could ever happen to me had already happened. Big surprise, that didn’t help. But at some point, I finally accepted that this wasn’t any kind of nightmare. This was my new reality, and I had better learn to deal or the tears would never stop flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach night I sat on the ledge seat in front of my room’s only window, looking down at my new backyard. There was half an acre of trees, hills and flowers, and a stockade fence that marked the property boundaries. Beyond the fence was a hill spotlighted by a golden sliver of moonlight, but because of the steepness of the incline, I couldn’t see anything more than thick, towering trunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tired, but I wouldn’t be sleeping. Any time I drifted off, I dreamed of the accident. I preferred to spend my time searching for my dad’s monsters, not sure whether I wanted to prove they existed or that they didn’t, remembering all the times I’d caught my dad doing the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad had carried a gun, though I’d never heard him shoot it. Now I had to wonder if a gun would actually help. The monsters had slipped past human skin…like ghosts…or the demons I’d been so unsure about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is ridiculous. The monsters weren’t \u0026nbsp;real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, a few times since the accident, I was certain that I’d spied one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, the bushes swayed. I leaned forward until my nose pressed into the glass. Probably the wind, I thought, even as I watched tree limbs stretch toward each other. Limbs, not arms, surely. And those were leaves, not hands. Surely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of white caught my attention, and I gulped. That wasn’t a woman with stooped shoulders darting between the trees but a deer. Had to be a deer, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeer didn’t wear wedding gowns, did they.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pumped a fist into the pane, rattling the entire window, and the woman—deer—darted away, swiftly hidden by the trees. I waited several long minutes, but she— it—never came back into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the sun rose, my eyelids felt like sandpaper against my eyes. I had to stop doing this, had to stop torturing myself. Otherwise, I’d have to throw in the towel and admit I’d inherited my dad’s crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd wouldn’t that just be irony at its finest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that thought, I didn’t laugh with bitterness, cry, or even crawl into bed. I began planning the next night’s watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEerily Curiouser and Eerily Curiouser…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer break passed far too quickly, and the first day of my junior year finally arrived. Asher High was on the outskirts of Birmingham, only a ten-minute drive from my grandparents’ house. Go Tigers. The bus turned the ten-minute drive into forty. But you know, I was glad for every one of those extra minutes. Like I’d told Kat that day at the hospital, my mom and dad had graduated from Asher, and all I could think about was whether their pictures were hanging in any of the display cases. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-6.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
