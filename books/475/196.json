When summer winds are blowing, and we smell the roses nigh; There is little effort needed to obey His precious will When it leads through flower-decked valley, or over sun-kissed hill. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is when the rain is falling, or the mist hangs in the air, When the road is dark and rugged, and the wind no longer fair, When the rosy dawn has settled in a shadowland of gray, That we find it hard to trust Him, and are slower to obey. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to trust Him when the singing birds have come, And their canticles are echoed in our heart and in our home; But \u0027tis when we miss the music, and the days are dull and drear, That we need a faith triumphant over every doubt and fear. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd our blessed Lord will give it; what we lack He will supply; Let us ask in faith believing-on His promises rely; He will ever be our Leader, whether smooth or rough the way, And will prove Himself sufficient for the needs of every day. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo trust in spite of the look of being forsaken; to keep crying out into the vast, whence comes no returning voice, and where seems no hearing; to see the machinery of the world pauselessly grinding on as if self-moved, caring for no life, nor shifting a hair-breadth for all entreaty, and yet believe that God is awake and utterly loving; to desire nothing but what comes meant for us from His hand; to wait patiently, ready to die of hunger, fearing only lest faith should fail-such is the victory that overcometh the world, such is faith indeed. ---George MacDonald \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e七月十五日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「使我们胜了世界的，就是我们的信心。（约翰壹书五:4）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　什么叫作胜了世界呢？\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　胜了世界就是说，虽然你的环境告诉你神已经弃绝了你，你对于神的信赖，却仍然丝毫不移；虽然你的祷告得不着答应，好似神并没听见一般，你却仍然继续呼喊着；虽然你看见世上充满了残忍，毫不顾惜人类的生命，也不顾念人类的恳求，你却仍然相信神是醒着的，并且是全然慈爱的。除神亲手给你的东西以外，并不愿望别的；忍耐等候，宁愿饿死，也不愿失去丝毫信心━这就是胜了世界，这就是真实的信心。── 麦唐纳 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5266.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:45:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:45:35 AM"}
