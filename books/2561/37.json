The light continued to improve and the temperature continued to rise. By half-past one it felt less like a winter night and more like a gentle summer morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare was asleep. With no other distractions I divided my attention between getting to the rocky outcrop and keeping a close watch on the skies overhead. There was still an incredible amount of activity taking place above the countryside that we had left behind. I wondered how many people were left alive there. An hour or so ago I had stood and watched thousands upon thousands of innocent lives being ended in seconds. It seemed possible - no, it seemed probable - to think that the land we were running from might now be devoid of all human life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to reinforce their complete and unarguable domination of the planet, as I watched the heavens above me I saw countless new ships arrive. Different in shape and size to those I had seen before but somehow still familiar, I guessed that each one would have a specific part to play in the alien\u0027s work to change, modify and mutate the land which I had once called home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare began to stir. She sat up and rubbed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay?\u0027 I asked. She shrugged her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Suppose,\u0027 she grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped rowing and sat and watched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sure you\u0027re okay?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, looked at me, and then looked away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m fine...\u0027 she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But...?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are we doing, Tom?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Making the most of what\u0027s left,\u0027 I quickly replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But why? What good is it going to do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. We both knew that we were just delaying the inevitable. \u0027Where are we going to shelter on these rocks?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Joe Porter said that...\u0027 I started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know what Joe Porter said,\u0027 she interrupted, \u0027you\u0027ve already told me. But what are we going to do long term? What are we going to do for food? Where are we going to sleep? There\u0027s nothing there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve got supplies in the rucksacks, that should be enough for a few days at least.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay so we can eat for a day or two. What next? What if we\u0027re still alive and all the food\u0027s used up? Then what are we going to do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We could fish,\u0027 I said, instinctively and foolishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You going to make yourself a bloody rod and sit on top of the rocks fishing are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If I have to, yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, come on...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter with you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you going to make this rod from?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s no fucking wood on the rocks. What are you going to make the rod from?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll use this paddle if I have to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And if you catch any, how are you going to cook the fish?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve got matches, we could...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know that,\u0027 she snapped, \u0027but what are you going to do? Burn the fucking boat?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right but I couldn\u0027t bring myself to respond. I picked up the paddle and began to dig deep into the water again. We\u0027d find a way to survive. We had managed so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Porter had been right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eventually reached the rocks and, just as he\u0027d told me, on the farthest side of the largest rock we found a small shingle shore, no more than fifteen feet square. I dragged the boat as far up the shore as I could and wedged the hull between two large boulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare and I found a little sheltered area where we could sit and wait together and watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we had been sitting together for a short while I asked her how she was feeling. She shook her head but didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy three o\u0027clock that morning it was as light as day. I watched hundreds of alien ships crawling high through the perfect clear blue sky like ants. Hundreds more were working tirelessly close to the surface of the planet. I saw more ships like the one that had flown close to us while we had been in the boat. Even though it was light I could clearly see that they were each dragging behind them a brilliant curtain of energy. I saw several of them flying together in slow unison. Their purpose was clear. They were cleansing the face of the planet. Burning away the last traces of man. Sterilising the land. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-37.html","bookId":2561,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM"}
