{"id":16622,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII THE LAST OF THE CLASSIC POETS","content":"The first half of the seventeenth century saw an extraordinary re-awakening of the Irish literary spirit. This was the more curious because it was precisely at this period that the old Gaelic polity with its tribal system, brehon law, hereditary bards, and all its other supports, was being upheaved by main force and already beginning to totter to its ruin. This was the period when to aggravate what was already to the last degree bitter—the struggle for the soil and racial feuds—a third disastrous ingredient, polemics, stept in, and inflamed the minds of the opposing parties, with the additional fanaticism of religious hatred. Yet whether it is that their works have been better preserved to us than those of any other century, or whether the very nearness of the end inspired them to double exertions, certain it is that the seventeenth century, and especially the first half of it, produced amongst the Irish a number of most gifted men of letters. Of these the so-called Four Masters, Seathrun or Geoffrey Keating, Father Francis O\u0027Mulloy, Lughaidh [Lewy] O\u0027Clery, and Duald Mac Firbis were the most important of the purely Irish prose writers, whilst Phillip O\u0027Sullivan Beare, Father Ward, and Father Colgan, John Lynch (Bishop of Killala), Luke Wadding,[Pg 515] and Peter Lombard (Archbishop of Armagh), reflected credit upon their native country by their scholarship, and elucidated its history chiefly through the medium of Latin, as did Ussher and Sir James Ware, two great scholars of the same period produced by the Pale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The century opened with an outburst of unexpected vigour on the part of the old school of Irish classical bards, over whose head the sword was then suspended, and whose utter destruction, though they knew it not, was now rapidly approaching. This outburst was occasioned by Teig mac Dairé,[1] the ollamh or chief poet of Donough O\u0027Brien, fourth Earl of Thomond, (whose star, thanks to English influence, was at that time in the ascendant), making little of and disparaging in elaborate verse the line of Eremon,[2] and the reigning families of Meath, Connacht, Leinster, and Ulster, whilst exalting the kings of the line of Eber, of whom the O\u0027Briens were at that time the greatest family. The form this poem took was an attack upon the poems of Torna Eigeas, a poet who flourished soon after the year 400, and who was tutor to Niall of the Nine Hostages, but whose alleged poems I have not noticed, not believing those attributed to him to be genuine, as they contain distinct Christian allusions, and as the language does not seem particularly antique. The bards, however, accepted these pieces as the real work of Torna, and Teig mac Dairé now attacks him on account of his partiality for the Eremonian Niall one thousand two hundred years before, and argues that he had done wrong, and that Eber, as the elder son of Milesius, should have had the precedency over Ir and Eremon, the younger children, and that consequently the princes of Munster, who were Eberians, should take precedency of the O\u0027Nialls, O\u0027Conors, and other Eremonians of the Northern provinces, and of Leinster. Teig asserts that it[Pg 516] was Eber or Heber, son of Milesius, from whom Ireland was called Hiber-nia. This poem, which contained about one hundred and fifty lines, began with the words Olc do thagrais a Thorna, \"Ill hast thou argued, O Torna,\" and was immediately taken up and answered by Lughaidh [Lewy] O\u0027Clery, the ollamh of the O\u0027Donnells, in a poem containing three hundred and forty lines, beginning \"O Teig, revile not Torna.\" To this Teig replied in a piece of six hundred and eighty-eight lines, beginning Eist-se a Lughaidh rem\u0027 labhradh, \"Listen to my speech, O Lewy,\" and was again immediately answered in a poem of about a thousand lines by O\u0027Clery, beginning, Do chuala ar thagrais a Thaidhg, \"I have heard all that thou hast argued, O Teig.\" In this poem O\u0027Clery collects such facts as he can find in history and in ancient authors, to prove that the Eremonians had always been considered superior to the Eberians in past ages. This called forth another rejoinder from his opponent of one hundred and twenty-four lines, beginning A Lughaidh labhram go séimh, \"Let us speak courteously, O Lewy,\" which was in its turn answered by O\u0027Clery in a poem beginning Ná broisd mise a Mhic Dhaire, \"Provoke me not, O son of Dairé.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By this time the attention of the whole Irish literary world had been centred upon this curious dispute, and on the attacks and rejoinders of these leading poets representing the two great races of Northern and Southern Ireland respectively. Soon the hereditary poets of the other great Gaelic houses joined in, as their own descent or inclination prompted. Fearfeasa O\u0027Cainte, Torlough O\u0027Brien, and Art Og O\u0027Keefe were the principal supporters of Teig mac Daire and the Southern Eberians, while Hugh O\u0027Donnell, Robert Mac Arthur, Baoghalach ruadh Mac Egan, Anluan Mac Egan, John O\u0027Clery, and Mac Dermot of Moylurg, defended Lewy and the Northern Eremonians. For many years the conflict raged, and the verses of both parties collected into a volume of about seven thousand lines, is known to this day as \"The Contention of the Poets.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 517]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is something highly pathetic in this last flickering up of the spirit of the hereditary classical bards, who conducted this dispute in precisely the same metre, language, tone, and style, as their forefathers of hundreds of years before would have done it, and who chose for the subject-matter of dispute an hereditary quarrel of twelve hundred years\u0027 standing. Just as the ancient history of the Irish began with the distinction between the descendants of the sons of Milesius, of which we read so much at the beginning of this volume, soon the self-same subject does the literary spirit of the ancient time which had lasted with little alteration from the days of St. Patrick, flare up into light for a brief moment at the opening of the seventeenth century, ere it expired for ever under the sword of Cromwell and of William.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is altogether probable, however, that under the appearance of literary zeal and genealogical fury, the bards who took part in this contest were really actuated by the less apparent motive of rousing the ardour of their respective chiefs, their pride of blood, and their hatred of the intruder. If this, as I strongly suspect, were the underlying cause of the \"Contention,\" their expiring effort to effect the impossible by the force of poetry—the only force at their command—is none the less pathetic, than would have been on the very brink of universal ruin, their quarrelling, in the face of their common enemy, upon the foolish old genealogies of a powerless past.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We know a good deal, however, about this Teig, son of Dairé, the ollamh of the O\u0027Briens, of whose poetry, all written in elaborate and highly-wrought classical metres, we have still about three thousand four hundred lines. He possessed down even to the middle of the seventeenth century a fine estate and the castle of Dunogan with its appurtenances, which belonged to him by right of his office, as the hereditary ollamh of Thomond. He was hurled over a cliff in his old age by a soldier of Cromwell, who is said to have yelled after him with savage exultation as he fell, \"Say your rann now, little man.\"[3][Pg 518] A beautiful inauguration ode to the English-bred Donogh O\u0027Brien, fourth Earl of Thomond, proclaims him a bard of no ordinary good sense and merit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Bring thy case before Him (God) every day, beseech diligently Him from whom nothing may be concealed, concerning everything of which thou art in care, Him from whom thou shalt receive relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Run not according to thine own desire, O Prince of the Boru tribute, let the cause of the people be thy anxiety, and that is not the anxiety of an idle man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Be not thou negligent in the concerns of each: since it is thy due to decide between the people, O smooth countenance, be easy of access, and diligent in thine own interests.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Give not thyself up to play nor wine nor feast nor the delight of music nor the caresses of maidens; measure thou the ill-deeds of each with their due reward, without listening to the intervention of thy council.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"For love, for terror, for hatred, do not pass (be thou a not-hasty judge) a judgment misbecoming thee, O Donough—no not for bribes of gold and silver.\"[4]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In another poem, Mac Dairé warns the O\u0027Briens to be advised by him, and not plunge the province into war, and to take care how they draw down upon themselves his animosity. Here are a few of these verses, translated into the exact equivalent of the Deibhidh metre in which they are written.

Teig Dall O\u0027H?ginn has left behind him at least three thousand lines, all in polished classical metres, and[Pg 520] O\u0027Hussey nearly four thousand. Teig Dall was the author of the celebrated poem addressed to Brian O\u0027Rorke, urging him to take up arms against Elizabeth on the principle \"si vis pacem para bellum:\" it begins D\u0027fhior cogaidh comhailtear síothchain \"to a man of war peace is assured,\" and it had the desired effect. The verses of these bards throw a great deal of light upon the manners customs and politics of the age. There is a curious poem extant by this Teig Dall, in which he gives a graphic account of a night he spent in the house of Maolmordha Mac Sweeny, a night which the poet says he will remember for ever.[7] He met on that memorable night in that hospitable house Brian mac Angus Mac Namee, the poet in chief to Torlogh Luineach O\u0027Neill, Brian mac Owen O\u0027Donnellan, the poet of Mac William of Clanrickard, and Conor O\u0027H?ginn, the bard of Mac William-Burke. Not only did the chieftain himself, Mac Sweeny, pay him homage, but he received presents—acknowledgment evidently of his admitted genius—from the poets as well. Mac Sweeny gave to him a dappled horse, one of the best steeds in Ireland, Brian mac Angus gave him a wolf-dog that might be matched against any; while from Brian mac Owen he received a book \"a full well of the true stream of knowledge,\"—in which were writ \"the cattle-spoils, courtships, and sieges of the world, an explanation of their battles and progress, it was the flower of the King-books of Erin.\"[8] Where, he asks, are all those chiefs gone now? Alas! \"the like of the men I found before me in that perfect rath of glistening splendour, ranged along the coloured sides of the purple-hung mansion, no eye[Pg 521] ever saw before,\"[9] but they are scattered and gone, and the death of four of them in especial seemed a loss from which Banba [Ireland] thought she could never recover. This great poet, in my opinion by far the finest of his contemporaries, came to a tragical end. Six of the O\u0027Haras of Sligo calling at his house, ate up his provisions, and in return he issued against them a special satire. This satire, consisting of twelve ranns in Deibhidh [D\u0027yevvee] metre,[10] stung them to such a pitch that they returned and cut out the tongue that could inflict such exquisite pain, and poor O\u0027H?ginn died of their barbarous ill-treatment some time prior to the year 1617. None of the bardic race had ever thought that such an end could overtake the great poet at the hands of the Gael themselves. It was only a short time before that, when some bard envying him his position at Coolavin in the west, far from the inroads of the murdering foreigner, had sung:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Would I Were in Cool-O-vinn\n\u003cbr\u003e Where Haunteth Teig O Higinn\n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 522]There my LEASE of LIFE were free\n\u003cbr\u003e From STRIFE in PEACE and Plenty.\"[11]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We find the poet O\u0027Gnive, the author of the well-known poem, \"The Stepping-down of the Gael,\"[12] bitterly lamenting in Deibhidh metre, the death of O\u0027H?ginn, and that breaking-up of the Bardic schools which was even then beginning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fallen the LAND of Learned men,\n\u003cbr\u003e The Bardic BAND is fallen;\n\u003cbr\u003e None now LEARN true SONG to Sing,\n\u003cbr\u003e How LONG our FERN is Fading!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fearful your Fates O\u0027Higinn,\n\u003cbr\u003e And Yohy Mac Melaughlinn,\n\u003cbr\u003e Dark was the DAY through FEUD Fell\n\u003cbr\u003e The GOOD, the GAY, the GENTLE.[13]\n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 523]\n\u003cbr\u003e Ye were Masters Made to please\n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Higinnses, O\u0027Dalys;\n\u003cbr\u003e GLOOMY ROCKS have WRought your fates,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ye PLUMY FLOCKS of Poets.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Hussey, probably the greatest contemporary rival of Teig Dall, is best known through Mangan\u0027s translation of his noble ode to Cuchonnacht Maguire, lord of Fermanagh,[14] who was caught by the elements on some warlike expedition and in danger of being frozen and drowned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is my chief, my master, this black night? movrone!\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, cold, cold, miserably cold is this black night for Hugh,\n\u003cbr\u003e Its showery, arrowy, speary sleet pierceth one through and through,\n\u003cbr\u003e Pierceth one to the very bone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An awful, a tremendous night is this, meseems,\n\u003cbr\u003e The floodgates of the rivers of heaven I think have been burst wide,\n\u003cbr\u003e Down from the overcharged clouds, like unto headlong ocean\u0027s tide,\n\u003cbr\u003e Descends grey rain in roaring streams.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Though he were even a wolf ranging the round green woods,\n\u003cbr\u003e Though he were even a pleasant salmon in the unchainable sea,\n\u003cbr\u003e Though he were a wild mountain eagle, he could scarce bear, he,\n\u003cbr\u003e This sharp sore sleet, these howling floods.\"[15]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 524]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When it is remembered that O\u0027Hussey composed this poem in that most difficult and artificial of metres, the Deibhidh, of which we have just given specimens, it will be seen how much Mangan has gained by his free and untrammelled metre, and what technical difficulties fettered O\u0027Hussey\u0027s art, and lent glory to his triumph over them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both these great poets and their contemporaries had been reared in the bardic colleges, which continued to exist, though with gradually diminishing prestige, until near the close of the seventeenth century. I doubt if a single college survived into the eighteenth, to come under the cruel law which made it penal for a Catholic to teach a school. In the seventeenth century, however, several famous colleges of poetry are still found. They are frequently alluded to by the poets of that century, both in Ireland and Scotland, and always under the generic name of \"the schools,\" by which they mean the bardic institutions. Few or none of those persons who did not themselves come of a bardic tribe were admitted into them, which accounts for the prevalence of the same surnames among the poets for several centuries, O\u0027Dalys, O\u0027H?ginnses, O\u0027Coffeys, Macgraiths, Conmees, Wards, O\u0027Mulconrys,[16] etc. None of the students were allowed to come from the neighbourhood of the college, but only from far-away parts of Ireland, so as not to be distracted by the propinquity of friends and relations.[Pg 525] This produced a certain unity of feeling among the bardic race, and to a great extent broke down all class prejudice, so much so, that the bards were almost the only people in later Ireland who belonged to their country rather than to their lord, or tribe, or territory. It may very well be, however, that the bardic race was not in the long run an advantage to Ireland, and that the elaborate system of pedigrees which they preserved, and their eulogies upon their particular patrons tended to keep the clan spirit alive to the detriment of the idea of a unified nationality, and to the exclusion of new political modes of thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However this may be, it is absolutely necessary to study the poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries if one would come to a right understanding of the great transformation scene then being enacted. The feelings, aspirations, and politics of the Irish themselves are faithfully reflected in them, and though no Irish historian, except perhaps O\u0027Halloran, has ever read them, yet no historian can afford to utterly neglect them. It has become common of late years to deny that there was any real national struggle of Ireland against England in the seventeenth century, and my friend Mr. Standish O\u0027Grady, in particular, from a perusal of the English State Papers and other documents, has striven with eloquence and brilliancy to prove that the fight was a social and an economic one, a conflict between the smaller gentry and the great upper lords. But such a view of the case is flatly contradicted, indeed absolutely disproved, by a study of the Irish bards. The names of Erin, Banba, Fódhla, the Plain of Conn, the Land of the Children of Ir and Eber, are in their mouths at every moment, and to the very last they persisted in their efforts to combine the Gael against the Gall. Here, for instance, is a poem, one specimen out of scores, by an unknown poet of the sixteenth century, exhorting the Irish of all the provinces to resistance, and it would be impossible to tell to what tribe or even to what province the poet belonged. I translate the poem here into a modification of the Irish metre,[Pg 526] and one which, it seems to me, could be very well taken over and adapted with a fairly good effect into English.[17]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fooboon upon you, ye hosts of the Gael,\n\u003cbr\u003e For your own Innisfail has been taken,\n\u003cbr\u003e And the Gall is dividing the emerald lands\n\u003cbr\u003e By your treacherous bands forsaken.[18]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clan Carthy of Munster from first unto last\n\u003cbr\u003e Have forsaken the past of their sires,\n\u003cbr\u003e And they honour no longer the men that are gone,\n\u003cbr\u003e Or the song of the God-sent lyres.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The O\u0027Briens of Banba whom Murrough led on,\n\u003cbr\u003e They are gone with the Saxon aggressor,\n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 527]They have bartered the heirloom of ages away\n\u003cbr\u003e And forgotten to slay the oppressor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old race of Brian mac Yohy[19] the stern,\n\u003cbr\u003e With gallowglass kerne and bonnacht,[20]\n\u003cbr\u003e They are down on their knees, they are cringing to-day,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Tis the way through the province of Connacht.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the valleys of Leinster the valorous band\n\u003cbr\u003e Who lightened the land with their daring,\n\u003cbr\u003e In Erin\u0027s dark hour now shift for themselves,\n\u003cbr\u003e The wolves are upon them and tearing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And O\u0027Neill, who is throned in Emania afar,\n\u003cbr\u003e And gave kings unto Tara for ages,\n\u003cbr\u003e For the earldom of Ulster has bartered, through fear,\n\u003cbr\u003e The kingdom of heroes and sages.[21]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas for the sight! the O\u0027Carrolls of Birr\n\u003cbr\u003e Swear homage in terror, sore fearing,\n\u003cbr\u003e Not a man one may know for a man, can be found\n\u003cbr\u003e On the emerald ground of Erin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And O\u0027Donnell[22] the chieftain, the lion in fight,\n\u003cbr\u003e Who defended the right of Tirconnell,\n\u003cbr\u003e (Ah! now may green Erin indeed go and droop!)\n\u003cbr\u003e He stoops with them—Manus O\u0027Donnell!\n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 528]\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fooboon for the court where no English was spoke,\n\u003cbr\u003e Fooboon for the yoke of the stranger,\n\u003cbr\u003e Fooboon for the gun in the foreigner\u0027s train,\n\u003cbr\u003e Fooboon for the chain of danger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ye faltering madmen, God pity your case!\n\u003cbr\u003e In the flame of disgrace ye are singeing.\n\u003cbr\u003e Fooboon is the word of the bard and the saint,\n\u003cbr\u003e Fooboon for the faint and cringing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The session of the bardic schools began about Michaelmas,[23] and the youthful aspirants to bardic glory came trooping, about that season, from all quarters of the four provinces to offer with trembling hearts their gifts to the ollamh of the bardic college, and to take possession of their new quarters. Very extraordinary these quarters were; for the college usually consisted of a long low group of whitewashed buildings, excessively warmly thatched, and lying in the hollow of some secluded valley, or shut in by a sheltering wood, far removed from noise of human traffic and from the bustle of the great world. But what most struck the curious beholder was the entire absence of windows or partitions over the greater portion of the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e According as each student arrived he was assigned a windowless room to himself, with no other furniture in it than a couple of chairs, a clothes rail, and a bed. When all the students had arrived, a general examination of them was held by the professors and ollamhs, and all who could not read and write Irish well, or who appeared to have an indifferent memory, were usually sent away. The others were divided into classes, and the mode of procedure was as follows: The students were called together into the great hall or sitting-room, amply illuminated by candles and bog-torches, and we may imagine the head ollamh, perhaps the venerable and patriotic O\u0027Gnive himself, addressing them upon their chosen profession, and finally proposing some[Pg 529] burning topic such as O\u0027Neill\u0027s abrogation of the title of O\u0027Neill, for the higher class to compose a poem on, in perhaps the Great or Little Rannaigheacht [Ran-ee-?cht] metre, while for the second class he sets one more commonplace, to be done into Deibhidh [D\u0027yevvee] or Séadna [Shayna], or some other classic measure, and any student who does not know all about the syllabification, quartans, concord, correspondence, termination, and union, which go to the various metres, is turned over to an inferior professor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The students retired after their breakfasts, to their own warm but perfectly dark compartments, to throw themselves each upon his bed,[24] and there think and compose till supper-hour, when a servant came round to all the rooms with candles, for each to write down what he had composed. They were then called together into the great hall, and handed in their written compositions to the professors, after which they chatted and amused themselves till bed-time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On every Saturday and the eve of every holiday the schools broke up, and the students dispersed themselves over the country. They were always gladly received by the landowners of the neighbourhood, and treated hospitably until their return on Monday morning. The people of the district never failed to send in, each in turn, large supplies to the college, so that, what between this and the presents brought by the students at the beginning of the year, the professors are said to have been fairly rich.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The schools always broke up on the 25th of March, and the holidays lasted for six months, it not being considered judicious to spend the warm half of the year in the close college, from which all light and air-draughts had been so carefully excluded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I can hardly believe, however, that the students of law, history, and classics—all the educated classes could speak[Pg 530] Latin, which was their means of communication with the English[25]—were treated as here described, or enjoyed such long holidays. It was probably only a special class of candidates for bardic degrees who were thus dealt with, and the account above given may be somewhat exaggerated; the students probably composed in their dark compartments only on certain days.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the seventeenth century we find that the three or four hundred metres taught in the schools of the tenth century had been practically restricted to a couple of dozen, and these nearly all heptasyllabic. It is quite probable, as Thurneysen asserts, that the metres of the early Roman hymns—themselves probably largely affected by Celtic models—exercised in their turn a reflex influence upon Irish poetry, and especially on that of the bards, in contradistinction to that of the filés. Indeed, it is pretty certain that if the Roman metres had not before existed in Irish the bards would have made no scruple about copying them; and they may thus have come by these octosyllabic and heptasyllabic lines about which they were in after times so particular. Of the metres chiefly in vogue in the schools of the later centuries, the most popular was the Deibhidh, of which I have already given so many examples.[26] It was, as it were, the official metre—the hexameter of the Gael. All the seven thousand and odd lines of the \"Contention of the Bards,\" for instance, are written in it. Great Rannaigheacht[27] [Ran-ee-?cht] was another prime heptasyllabic favourite. It ran thus—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 531]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To Hear Handsome Women WEEP,\n\u003cbr\u003e In DEEP distress Sobbing Sore,\n\u003cbr\u003e Or Gangs of Geese scream for FAR,\n\u003cbr\u003e They sweeter ARE than ARTS snore.\"[28]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I may observe here that there has been on the part of[Pg 532] Irish Continental scholars an extraordinary amount of discordant theories as to the scansion of the Irish classical metres. None of them seem to be agreed as to how to scan them. Zimmer insists that the word-accent and the metrical accent in Irish are identical, which, as Kuno Meyer has shown, is plainly not the case. He would probably scan—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or wíld geese thát scream fróm fàr,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e while Kuno Meyer again would insist on reading—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"ór wild geése that scréam from fár,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e because, as he says, all heptasyllabic lines are to be read as trochaic, a theory which may apply very well to some lines, as to the above, but which is almost certain to break down after a line or two, as in the very next line of this verse which I have taken for a model—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Théy sweet / ér are / thán Arts / snóre,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e a scansion which does extraordinary violence to the natural pronunciation of the words. I, for my part, do not believe that there was ever any real metrical accent, that is, any real alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables in the classical Irish metres.[29] The one thing certain about them is the fixed number of syllables and the rhyme, but each verse was, as it were, separately scanned, if one may use such a term, on its[Pg 533] own merits. Thus the verse just quoted would be read some way thus—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To hear handsome\n\u003cbr\u003e Women weep\n\u003cbr\u003e In deep distress,\n\u003cbr\u003e Sobbing sore,\n\u003cbr\u003e Or gangs of geese\n\u003cbr\u003e Scream from far,\n\u003cbr\u003e They sweeter are\n\u003cbr\u003e Than Arts snore.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I have frequently heard preserved in ranns or proverbs, even to this day, isolated quatrains in these classic metres pronounced by the people,[30] and they never dream of pronouncing them otherwise than according to the natural stress of the voice upon the words themselves, as if they were talking prose,—they never attempt to transform the seven-syllable lines into trochees, as Kuno Meyer would, nor the eight-syllable lines into iambics. Of this old Gaelic prosody there appears to be a[Pg 534] distinct reminiscence in Burns. Take this verse of his for example—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Blythe, blythe, and merry was she,\n\u003cbr\u003e Blythe was she but and ben,\n\u003cbr\u003e Blythe by the banks of Ern,\n\u003cbr\u003e And blythe in Glenturit glen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This, supplying, say the syllable \"and,\" in the second and third lines makes a good Rannaigheacht mór quatrain, which the poet evidently pronounced exactly as an old Irish bard would have done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Blythe, blythe,\n\u003cbr\u003e And merry was she,\n\u003cbr\u003e And blythe was she\n\u003cbr\u003e But and ben,\n\u003cbr\u003e Blythe by\n\u003cbr\u003e The banks of Ern,\n\u003cbr\u003e And blythe in\n\u003cbr\u003e Glenturit glen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bonaventura O\u0027Hussey was another fine classical poet of the beginning of the seventeenth century. He was educated for a bard, but afterwards became a Franciscan in Louvain, where he wrote and published an Irish work on Christian Doctrine in 1608, which was reprinted in Antwerp three years later. The Irish, having no press of their own in Ireland (though they had some outside it), were obliged to print and set up all their books abroad, chiefly at Louvain, Antwerp, Rome, and Paris. Any attempt to introduce founts of Irish type in the teeth of the English Government would, I think, have been futile, so that except for the works she was able to print in Irish type abroad, and afterwards to smuggle in, Ireland during the seventeenth century was thrown nearly a couple of hundred years out of the world\u0027s course, by having to use manuscripts instead of printed books. It is curious to find O\u0027Hussey compressing the Christian doctrine into two hundred and forty lines of the most accurate Deibhidh metre. When leaving for his foreign home he bade farewell to Erin in a poem of great beauty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 535]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Slowly pass my Aching Eye,\n\u003cbr\u003e Her Holy Hills of beauty\n\u003cbr\u003e Neath me TOSSING To and fro,\n\u003cbr\u003e Hoarse CRies the CROSSING billow.\"[31]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In another poem he laments sorely at leaving the poets and the schools \"to try another trade,\" that of a cleric, which he says he does, not because he thinks less of poetry, or because the glory that was once to be had from it was departing amongst the people of Erin, but from religious motives alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now I stand to Try a Trade\n\u003cbr\u003e Mid Bardic Band less famèd\n\u003cbr\u003e Than the Part of Poet is\n\u003cbr\u003e Hacked is my Heart in pieces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Tis not that I Veer from Verse\n\u003cbr\u003e So Followed by my Fathers,\n\u003cbr\u003e Lest the fame it Once did Win\n\u003cbr\u003e In vain be Asked in Erin.\"[32]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fearfeasa O\u0027Cainti was another well-known poet of this period who attempted to rouse the Irish to action.

Not more than a dozen of them have ever been published,[34] and yet no one can pretend[Pg 537] to understand the inner history of Ireland at that period without a reference to them. Their chief characteristic is an intense compression which produces an air of weighty sententiousness. This was necessitated by the laws of their composition, which required at the end of every second line a break or suspension of the sense (such as in English would be usually expressed by a semi-colon or colon), and which absolutely forbade any carrying over of the sense from one stanza into another. Hence the thought of the poet had with each fresh quatrain to be concentrated into twenty-eight syllables (thirty syllables in Séadna metre), with a break or pause at the end of the fourteenth (or fifteenth). Accordingly O\u0027Gnive calls the poets the \"schoolmen of condensed speech,\"[35] and the Scotch bard Mac Muirich in the Red Book of Clanranald speaks of Teig Dall O\u0027H?ginn as putting into less than a half-rann what others would take a whole crooked stanza to express.[36] The classical metres went, in Irish, under the generic name of Dán Direach, or \"straight verse;\" and O\u0027Molloy, who wrote an Irish prosody in Latin in the seventeenth century, carried away by a contemplation of its difficulties, exclaims that it is \"Omnium qu? unquam vidi vel audivi, ausim dicere qu? sub sole reperiuntur, difficilimum.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 538]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was during the seventeenth century that the greatest change in the whole poetical system of the Irish and Scotch Gaels was accomplished, and that a new school of versification arose with new ideals, new principles, and new methods, which we shall briefly glance at in the following chapter.\n\u003cbr\u003e ********\n\u003cbr\u003e [1] His real name was Mac Brodin, \"Daré\" or Dairé being his father\u0027s name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [2] See above, p. 64.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [3] See O\u0027Flanagan\u0027s \"Transactions of the Gaelic Society, 1808,\" p. 29.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [4] \"Ar ghrádh ar uamhan, ná ar fhuath\n\u003cbr\u003e Ná beir (bi ad\u0027 bhreitheamh neamh-luath)\n\u003cbr\u003e Breith nár chóir, a Dhonchadh, dhuit,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ar chomhthaibh óir ná arguit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This fine poem, containing in all 220 lines, was published by O\u0027Flanagan in 1808.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [5] \"Tig díom da ndearntaoi m\u0027fioghail\n\u003cbr\u003e Gríosadh bhur ngruadh lasamhail,\n\u003cbr\u003e Fios bhur gníomh a\u0027s gníomh bhur sean\n\u003cbr\u003e Tig a sgrios díom no a ndidean.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From a MS. of my own; this poem contains a hundred lines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [6] \"Ni bhi díon i ndiamhraibh gleann\n\u003cbr\u003e Ná i bhfíodh dhlúith uaignach fhairseang,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ná i múr caomh cneas-aolta cuir,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ag fear m\u0027easaonta ó\u0027m armuibh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Múchadh deigh-ghníomh, deargadh gruadh,\n\u003cbr\u003e Toirmeasg ratha re diombuan,\n\u003cbr\u003e Cur anma a\u0027s eachta ar fhear\n\u003cbr\u003e Creachta ár n-airm-ne re n-áireamh.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [7] \"Tánac oidhche go h-Eas-Caoile\n\u003cbr\u003e Budh cuimhin liom go lá an bhráith,\n\u003cbr\u003e Mairfidh choidhche ár ndol do\u0027n dún-sa\n\u003cbr\u003e Cor na h-oidhche a\u0027s cúrsa cháich.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Metre Séadna.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [8] \"Tána, Tochmairc, Toghla an bheatha,\n\u003cbr\u003e Do bhi \u0027san aiscidh fuair mé,\n\u003cbr\u003e Mineachadh a gcath, \u0027s a gcéimeann\n\u003cbr\u003e Sgath rí-leabhar Eireann é.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [9] \"Samhail na bhfear fuaireas rómham\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027San rath foirththe do b\u0027úr niamh\n\u003cbr\u003e Ar sleasaibh datha an dúin chorcra\n\u003cbr\u003e Ni fhaca súil rompa riamh.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e See Catalogue of Irish MSS. in British Museum.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [10] It commences:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sluagh seisir tháinig do m\u0027 thigh,\n\u003cbr\u003e Béarfad uaim iúl an tseisir,\n\u003cbr\u003e Tearc do lacht mé ar na mhárach\n\u003cbr\u003e O thart na ré selánach (i.e., bitheamhnach);\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and the last verse runs:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Guidhim Dia do dhóirt a fhuil\n\u003cbr\u003e O sé a mbás bheith na mbeathaidh,\n\u003cbr\u003e (Ni mhairid gar marthain sin!)\n\u003cbr\u003e Nár marbhthar an sluagh seisir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I.e., \"I pray to God who poured his blood, since it is their death to be in life,—they do not live whose living is that of theirs!—may that crew of six be never slain\"!

See above, pp. 33 and 34.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [20] Bonnacht is a \"mercenary soldier.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [21] \"O Néill Oiligh a\u0027s Eamhna\n\u003cbr\u003e Ri Teamhrach agus Tailltean,\n\u003cbr\u003e Tugsad ar iarlacht Uladh\n\u003cbr\u003e Ríoghacht go h-úmhal aimhghlic.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I.e., \"O\u0027Neill of Aileach and of Emania, King of Tara and of Tailtinn, they have given away for the earldom of Ulster, a kingdom submissively unwisely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [22] Manus O\u0027Donnell died in 1563, so that this poem must have been composed somewhat earlier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [23] This account of the later bardic schools is chiefly derived from a curious book, the \"Memoirs of Clanrickard,\" printed in London in 1722.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [24] Hence the bardic expression, \"luidhe i leabaibh sgol,\" i.e., \"to lie in the beds of the schools,\" equivalent to becoming a poet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [25] Campion, who wrote in 1574, says of the Irish of his day: \"They speake Latine like a vulgar language learned in their schooles of Leachcraft and law, whereat they begin children and holde on sixteene or twentie yeares.\" After the Battle of the Curlew Mountains, MacDermot, anxious to let the Governor know where the body of Sir Conyers Clifford lay, wrote a note to him in Latin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [26] See above, pp. 518-523.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [27] Of Little Rannaigheacht I gave an example a few pages back in the poem \"Fooboon.\" Séadna [Shayna] was another great favourite, built on the model of the following verse, with or without alliteration—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Teig of herds the Gallant Giver,\n\u003cbr\u003e Right receiver of our love,\n\u003cbr\u003e Teig thy Name shall KNow no ending,\n\u003cbr\u003e Branch un-Bending, Erin\u0027s glove.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This verse runs rhythmically, but that it does so is only an accident. The Irish could always have got their Séadna verses, at least, of eight and seven syllables, to run smoothly if they had wished, but they did not. Here is a more Irish-like stanza in the same metre—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of / lowliness / came a / daughter,\n\u003cbr\u003e And / he who / brought her / was / God,\n\u003cbr\u003e Noble / her / son and / stately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ennobling / greatly / this / sod.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Great Séadna is the same metre as this, except that every verse ends with a word of three syllables. In Middle Séadna the first and third lines end in trisyllables, the second and fourth in dissyllables. Ae-fri-Slighe is like Middle Séadna, except that instead of the first and third lines being octosyllabic, they all have seven syllables, as—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ye who bring to slavery\n\u003cbr\u003e Men of mind and reading,\n\u003cbr\u003e God bring down your bravery,\n\u003cbr\u003e Leave you vexed and bleeding.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Little Deachna is a pretty metre with five syllables to each line, as—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"God gives me three things,\n\u003cbr\u003e Them he brings all three\n\u003cbr\u003e When the soul is born\n\u003cbr\u003e Like a corn in me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Great Deachna contained eight and six syllables, each line ending in dissyllables—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I believe this wafer holy,\n\u003cbr\u003e Which is safer surely,\n\u003cbr\u003e Flesh, blood, Godhead strangely mingled,\n\u003cbr\u003e In bread bodied purely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The above metres are a few of the most favourite.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [28] \"Mná módhach\u0027 go ngoimh ag gul,\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan árach ar sgur d\u0027á mbrón,\n\u003cbr\u003e Caoi chadhain an oidhche fhuar\n\u003cbr\u003e Is binne \u0027ná fuaim do shrón.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From a manuscript of my own, a comic poem by an anonymous bard, on a snoring companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [29] Windisch appears to me to have come closest to the truth: \"If we suppose,\" he says, \"that the accented syllable coincides with the natural accent of the word, if we consider that polysyllabic words, besides having an accented syllable, can also have a semi-accented one (neben den Hauptton auch einen Nebenton haben k?nnen), finally, if we take it for granted that the syllables in which rhyme or alliteration appear must also bear the accent or up-beat of the voice (in der Hebung stehen mussen), we then at once come to the conclusion that each half-verse contains a specified number of accented syllables, without, however, any regular interchange of up and down beats of accented and unaccented syllables.\"—See \"Irische Texte,\" I. i. p. 157.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [30] Thus when O\u0027Carolan, in the last century, made the extempore response to the butler who prohibited his entering the cellar\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mo chreach a Dhiarmuid Ui Fhloinn\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan tu ar dorus ifrinn,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027S tu nach leigfeadh neach ad\u0027 chó\u0027r\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027San áit bheitheá do dhoirseóir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He spoke (perhaps unwittingly) an excellent Deibhidh stanza, but he never scanned it,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mó chreach / á Dhiar / múid Ui / Fhloínn\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan tu / ár dor / us if / rinn.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mo chreách / a Dhíarmuid / Uí / Fhloínn\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan tú / ar dórus / ifrinn.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, too, in a rann I heard from a friend in the county Mayo, and printed in my \"Religious Songs of Connacht,\" p. 232:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ni meisge is miste liom\n\u003cbr\u003e Acht leisg a feicsint orom [orm],\n\u003cbr\u003e Gan digh meisge\u0027s miste an greann\n\u003cbr\u003e Acht ni gnáth meisge gan mi-greann,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e which is not spoken as—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ní meis / gé is / míste liom,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e but as—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ni / méisge / is míste / liom.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [31] \"Do chuadar as rinn mo ruisg\n\u003cbr\u003e Do tholcha is áluinn éaguisg,\n\u003cbr\u003e Is tuar orcra dá n-éisi\n\u003cbr\u003e Dromla fhuar na h-aibheisi.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e From a manuscript of my own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [32] \"Ni fuath d\u0027ealadhain m\u0027 aithreach\n\u003cbr\u003e Thug fúm aigneadh aithrigheach,\n\u003cbr\u003e No an ghlóir do gheibhthí dá chionn\n\u003cbr\u003e Ar neimhuidh ó phór Eirionn.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From a manuscript of my own.

This interesting collection is chiefly dedicated to the praises of the Maguires of Fermanagh, and is the work of a number of accomplished poets, most of whom are unknown to O\u0027Reilly, even by name. The whole collection contains 5,576 lines, of which Herr Julius Stern has printed about a thousand, thus having the honour of being the first to render accessible a fair specimen of the work of the current poetry of the schools in the sixteenth century. The characteristics of this poetry he appraises, very justly as I think, in the following words, \"The language is choice and difficult, the poetry is of the traditional type, poor in facts, but elevated, stately, learned, and very artistic.\" See for this interesting article the \"Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie,\" II.
