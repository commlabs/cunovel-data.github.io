She had risen and was slowly circling Epiny, her knife low and ready. “Now what will you do, you skinny Jhernian wretch? Kill him and I’ll kill you. I’m bigger than you, and stronger. You know I’ll win. How long can you crouch over him, threatening him? What will you do when he wakes up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Epiny replied, but she answered Lisana, not Olikea. “It seems we are at an impasse.” After a moment, she added, “If my cousin Nevare is never to regain his body and his life, and I am to be attacked and killed anyway, then neither of us has anything to lose if I kill him now. Do you agree with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent, considering the question. I didn’t know what would become of me if Epiny killed my body. Did I care? Just the fact that I had no immediate answer to that question made me mute. For most of my life, I’d had goals that had driven me. What did I have now? Perhaps, like Epiny, I’d reached a dead end. Briefly, my cousin’s gaze met mine. I saw love in her eyes, but also resolution and resignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not look good for my body. Slowly I nodded at her. She shifted her gaze to Lisana. “You see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisana was quiet for a time. Then she asked abruptly, “What do you want, Jhernian? What will it take to make you leave this place and never return?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpiny was silent for a moment. I could see her hand trembling. I think the hatchet was getting heavy in her grip. “I assume you mean without killing him,” she said after a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Lisana bit off the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk to ME!” Olikea abruptly demanded. “I am the one who is here. I am the one who can kill you!” She made a menacing motion with her knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” Epiny barked at her, and touched the hatchet blade to Soldier’s Boy’s throat. He made a small sound in his throat. Olikea took a step back, glowering at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s dangerous, Epiny. Be very careful. She’ll kill you if she can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that,” Epiny said hoarsely. “I may have to kill your body.” Tears filled her eyes and spilled but only anger showed on her face. “How can it be any worse, Nevare? Shall I go down whimpering and begging for mercy? I doubt any would be shown. If I must lose it all, then at least I’ll extract a price from them. They’ll know I was here; I won’t be stepped on like an ant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desperate courage in her words moved me. “You should have been your father’s soldier son,” I told her quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s waking up!” Likari cried aloud. I’d almost forgotten the boy was there. He’d hovered at the outskirts, watching everything but saying and doing little. Now he pointed at my body. My eyelids fluttered and Soldier’s Boy’s hands twitched against the mossy ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpiny might not have understood Likari’s words, but the tone alerted her. She lowered the hatchet until its blade rested against Soldier’s Boy’s throat. He made an incoherent sound. I did not know if he protested the bite of the sharp edge or the burn of cold iron against his throat. Epiny leaned forward over him, so close that all he could see was her face. I watched his eyes blink bewilderedly and then focus on her. She spoke in a low growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t move. Listen to me. Tell that woman with the knife and the boy with the water skin to go away. Tell them that you don’t want them to hurt me. Send them down to wait by the stream. Tell them to stay there until you come to them. Say only those words. I will know what you say. If you say any more than that, or any less than that, I’ll kill you. Do you understand me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked his lips and rolled his eyes to look at Olikea. Epiny didn’t hesitate. She pressed the blade more firmly to his throat. Distantly, I felt it slice my skin and, more intensely, I felt the hot/cold kiss of iron against my flesh. It made my magic bleed, and that was more painful than the fine cut it scored on my skin. “Please, don’t!” Soldier’s Boy croaked. Epiny eased up but didn’t move the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell them,” she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Olikea. Likari. Go down the ridge to the stream. Wait for me there. Don’t do anything else right now, just wait down there until I come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpiny’s glance flickered to me. I confirmed that she’d been obeyed. “He did as you told him. He’s ordered them to go down to the stream and wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlikea looked rebellious. Likari wriggled in an agony of indecision, torn between curiosity and obedience. “Shall I leave you here, at her mercy?” Olikea began in protest, but Soldier’s Boy broke in on her words with, “Go. Just go now, or she’ll kill me. I can manage this situation better if you are not here, Olikea. Go down to the stream. Wait for me there.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/renegade-s-magic-the-soldier-son-trilogy-3/page-44.html","bookId":2015,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM"}
