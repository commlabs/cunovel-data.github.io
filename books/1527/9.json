The goal of this meeting was to evaluate the current situation in Somalia. While word was still pending on the search for the raiders’ ship via satellite, Painter wanted eyes on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, a pair of Black Hawks idled at a U.S. base to the north, in the neighboring tiny East African nation of Djibouti. SEAL Team Six, under the operational orders of Joint Special Operations Command, waited to be summoned once Amanda’s location was determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where was the First Daughter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmur explained his lack of concern for the hostage’s safety. He didn’t know about the victim being the president’s daughter, only that she was an American woman. “For the most part, Somali pirates make decent hosts. Beatings are rare, but they do occur. Otherwise, they keep their guests protected and well-fed. It does no one any good if a hostage dies. In fact, the feeding and housing of captured crews help maintain the economy of Puntland.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray knew how lucrative the piracy trade was. Last year alone, Somali pirates collected $160 million in ransom. And that was only the tip of the true cost of piracy in the region. The shipping industry and governments spent $7 billion during that same time, accruing additional expenses from insurance premiums, from heightened security, even rescue missions, like the recent one that secured the safe return of an American and a Danish citizen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what about the Somali government?” Seichan asked. “What are they doing about the rampant piracy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmur leaned back in his chair and lifted his arms hopelessly in the air. “What Somali government? The central government fell back in 1991, throwing the country into chaos. Without anyone patrolling our territorial waters, the tuna-rich seas around here were plundered and stripped by foreign fishing fleets, stealing the food and livelihood from our local people. Is it any wonder our fishermen armed themselves, becoming their own militia, and confronted the illegal boats and crews?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had read the briefings on the flight out here. “And those confrontations eventually led to the fishermen confiscating ships and personnel and demanding ransoms—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like a toll,” Amur corrected, earning a scoffing grunt from Kowalski. Their informant’s face reddened, his back stiffening with pride. Though the man had turned informant, Gray was reminded of the old adage: Once a pirate, always a pirate. Or maybe Amur’s justifications were merely a reflection of national pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We deserved some compensation for our plundered seas,” he continued. “Who else is looking after us? Look at the port here.” He nodded to the bustling harbor. “This place used to be a hellhole, with no infrastructure, no hope, everything crumbling apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski raised a skeptical eyebrow toward the dusty city, seeming to think the description of hellhole still fit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After the government fell,” Amur continued, “we took care of each other. A local businessman started our phone system. Teachers worked for free. The police are all volunteers, too. Now we’re one of the busiest ports in the region. A boomtown, as you say. We export tens of thousands of goats, sheep, and camels across the Arab world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski’s skeptical eyebrow refused to lower. Gray understood as he looked out at all the new construction going on across the nighttime city, at the palatial mansions rising behind high walls. He suspected not all of that largesse came from Boosaaso’s import/export industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had read how this city was still ranked as one of the most likely places to get kidnapped. Not exactly a high honor. Though the local government was attempting to change that. Its jails were full of pirates—but how much was that for international show? Piracy continued to be the main industry running the Puntland economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow were they going to make any headway in finding the president’s daughter against those economic odds? Money could free tongues—as it had with Amur Mahdi—but it also bought silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now the fishes return to our waters,” Amur said with a note of vindication and finality. “With the foreign fleets afraid to come near, our seas once again teem with tuna and our people are no longer hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had to admit that much was true. Somali piracy had a positive impact on reversing the overfishing of its territorial waters. But at what price?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmur stood up. “The night grows late. I will see what I can discover about this missing American woman. But as you know, rescue attempts over the past year have resulted in pirate deaths. It will not be easy getting information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stood and shook the man’s hand. He read between the lines. To break that silence would require additional funds. But Gray feared if too much money was thrown into the search, it could raise the suspicions of Amanda’s captors. A delicate balance had to be struck here—but for now they had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand. Do what you must,” Gray said. He shook the man’s hand and wished him good night, using his native tongue, which earned an appreciative smile from Amur. “Haben wanaagsan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray waited for Amur to leave the restaurant before motioning the others up. “We should get back to the hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed out as a group. Even at this hour, the streets were clogged with trucks, people, and carts. Sizzling food stands, tiny tea stalls, and makeshift shops packed both sides of the street. All around, Boosaaso bustled, hammered, rang, and shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kept to a tight knot as they traversed the crowded streets on their way toward their hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan spoke at his ear, her breath hot on his cheek. “You were right. We’ve picked up a tail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stopped at a fruit stand, studying the exotic fare while searching the street behind them. He noted two figures in street clothes who ducked out of sight as he had stopped. “Two of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three,” Seichan corrected. “The woman in the green sarong by the door of that Internet café.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary in her appearance, but he trusted Seichan’s assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski remained oblivious. He picked up a banana and sniffed at it. “Are we buying something or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray headed away, continuing toward their hotel, drawing the tail in his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So Amur is not as loyal as the CIA claimed,” Seichan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned toward him like a lover. Physical contact between men and women was frowned upon in this country, but there was a strange, heightened intimacy in being this close without touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Painter suspected as much,” Gray mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director had reviewed the various potential contacts here and selected Amur specifically because of discrepancies in his behavior in the past. It seemed the man was not above playing one side against the other, especially with big money involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a pirate, always a pirate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sauntered down the road with his teammates, not bothering to try to shake the tail. He wanted the others following his team. Amur was playing a dangerous game, but one that suited their purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause two could play that same game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:01 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker Wayne maintained a safe distance behind Amur Mahdi, keeping a city block between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio embedded in his ear buzzed. “Do you have him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Commander Pierce. Tucker touched his throat mike and subvocalized his answer. “Affirmative.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo blend in with the locals, he had pulled a loose plaid macawiis tunic over a thin Kevlar jacket and donned a regional turban to hide his hair and further shadow his features. Not that there weren’t white faces here. It seemed the city drew opportunists from around the globe. He heard German, Spanish, and French spoken alongside the continuous dialects of African languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he kept almost entirely out of sight of his target, trusting another’s eyes more than his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral meters ahead, Kane kept to the shadows, ghosting along, sticking to the crumbling wall of a palatial estate, gliding around and over obstacles. Few eyes glanced at the shepherd’s passage. Plenty of dogs—half-starved waifs, showing ribs and bony legs—roamed the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA block away, Amur turned a corner and angled away from the busier zone of newer hotels and larger estates. He moved with determination into a bulldozed section of the city, occupied by cranes, piles of rubble, and metal trailers, all in readiness for the expansion of the neighboring business district.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker radioed the change in direction. “He’s heading out of New Boosaaso, aiming for a rougher part of town. Definitely not going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker had memorized everything he could about his target, mapping out the man’s life in his head: where he lived, where he met friends for drinks, where his mistress was holed up. Amur wasn’t heading toward any of his usual haunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep following, but maintain your distance,” Gray warned. “We don’t want him spooked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know how to do my job, Tucker thought sourly as he reached the corner. This is what you hired me for—or, rather, hired us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane had already stopped at the corner and glanced back. Tucker signaled an open palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker surveyed the terrain ahead. Tall security fencing, screened by barrier fabric, lined both sides of the road, keeping pedestrians out of the construction zones. At this hour, no one else was in view. He had no choice but to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I follow, I’ll be immediately spotted, my cover blown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, they had a small advantage. Gray had gone to painstaking ends to keep knowledge of Tucker’s involvement in this mission secret. They’d even traveled from Tanzania to Somalia by different planes. Gray wanted all eyes diverted and focused on his team and away from Tucker, freeing him to move independently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the street, Amur stopped at a locked gate in the security fencing. A lounging guard with an AK-47 greeted him. They leaned their heads together, then the guard nodded and unlatched the gate. Amur vanished inside, drawing the guard with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is he up to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker headed down a few meters until he discovered a gap between the fence and the sandy ground. A tall metal Dumpster helped hide the spot. He drew Kane there, then pointed to the gap, circled a finger, and touched his nose. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-9.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
