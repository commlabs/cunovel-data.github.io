{"id":35489,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eCold, light rain beat against the pavement, as the car moved through the dark streets of New York City toward the police building.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You can see his point,\" one of the men said to Anderton. \"If you were in his place you\u0027d act just as decisively.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSullen and resentful, Anderton stared straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyhow,\" the man went on, \"you\u0027re just one of many. Thousands of people have gone to that detention camp. You won\u0027t be lonely. As a matter of fact, you may not want to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHelplessly, Anderton watched pedestrians hurrying along the rain-swept sidewalks. He felt no strong emotion. He was aware only of an overpowering fatigue. Dully, he checked off the street numbers: they were getting near the police station.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This Witwer seems to know how to take advantage of an opportunity,\" one of the men observed conversationally. \"Did you ever meet him?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Briefly,\" Anderton answered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted your job—so he framed you. Are you sure of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton grimaced. \"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just curious.\" The man eyed him languidly. \"So you\u0027re the ex-Commissioner of Police. People in the camp will be glad to see you coming. They\u0027ll remember you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt,\" Anderton agreed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Witwer sure didn\u0027t waste any time. Kaplan\u0027s lucky—with an official like that in charge.\" The man looked at Anderton almost pleadingly. \"You\u0027re really convinced it\u0027s a plot, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t harm a hair of Kaplan\u0027s head? For the first time in history, Precrime goes wrong? An innocent man is framed by one of those cards. Maybe there\u0027ve been other innocent people—right?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite possible,\" Anderton admitted listlessly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe the whole system can break down. Sure, you\u0027re not going to commit a murder -and maybe none of them were. Is that why you told Kaplan you wanted to keep yourself outside? Were you hoping to prove the system wrong? I\u0027ve got an open mind, if you want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnother man leaned over, and asked, \"Just between the two of us, is there really anything to this plot stuff? Are you really being framed?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton sighed. At that point he wasn\u0027t certain, himself. Perhaps he was trapped in a closed, meaningless time-circle with no motive and no beginning. In fact, he was almost ready to concede that he was the victim of a weary, neurotic fantasy, spawned by growing insecurity. Without a fight, he was willing to give himself up. A vast weight of exhaustion lay upon him. He was struggling against the impossible—and all the cards were stacked against him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp squeal of tires roused him. Frantically, the driver struggled to control the car, tugging at the wheel and slamming on the brakes, as a massive bread truck loomed up from the fog and ran directly across the lane ahead. Had he gunned the motor instead he might have saved himself. But too late he realized his error. The car skidded, lurched, hesitated for a brief instant, and then smashed head on into the bread truck.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUnder Anderton the seat lifted up and flung him face-forward against the door. Pain, sudden, intolerable, seemed to burst in his brain as he lay gasping and trying feebly to pull himself to his knees. Somewhere the crackle of fire echoed dismally, a patch of hissing brilliance winking in the swirls of mist making their way into the twisted hulk of the car.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHands from outside the car reached for him. Slowly he became aware that he was being dragged through the rent that had been the door. A heavy seat cushion was shoved brusquely aside, and all at once he found himself on his feet, leaning heavily against a dark shape and being guided into the shadows of an alley a short distance from the car. In the distance, police sirens wailed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll live,\" a voice grated in his ear, low and urgent. It was a voice he had never heard before, as unfamiliar and harsh as the rain beating into his face. \"Can you hear what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Anderton acknowledged. He plucked aimlessly at the ripped sleeve of his shirt. A cut on his cheek was beginning to throb. Confused, he tried to orient himself. \"You\u0027re not—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop talking and listen.\" The man was heavyset, almost fat. Now his big hands held Anderton propped against the wet brick wall of the building, out of the rain and the flickering light of the burning car. \"We had to do it that way,\" he said. \"It was the only alternative. We didn\u0027t have much time. We thought Kaplan would keep you at his place longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" Anderton managed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe moist, rain-streaked face twisted into a humorless grin. \"My name\u0027s Fleming. You\u0027ll see me again. We have about five seconds before the police get here. Then we\u0027re back where we started.\" A flat packet was stuffed into Anderton\u0027s hands. \"That\u0027s enough loot to keep you going. And there\u0027s a full set of identification in there. We\u0027ll contact you from time to time.\" His grin increased and became a nervous chuckle. \"Until you\u0027ve proved your point.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton blinked. \"It is a frameup, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Sharply, the man swore. \"You mean they got you to believe it, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought—\" Anderton had trouble talking; one of his front teeth seemed to be loose. \"Hostility toward Witwer . . . replaced, my wife and a younger man, natural resentment. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t kid yourself,\" the other said. \"You know better than that. This whole business was worked out carefully. They had every phase of it under control. The card was set to pop the day Witwer appeared. They\u0027ve already got the first part wrapped up. Witwer is Commissioner, and you\u0027re a hunted criminal.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s behind it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton\u0027s head spun. \"You\u0027re positive?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe man laughed. \"You bet your life.\" He glanced quickly around. \"Here come the police. Take off down this alley. Grab a bus, get yourself into the slum section, rent a room and buy a stack of magazines to keep you busy. Get other clothes—You\u0027re smart enough to take care of yourself. Don\u0027t try to leave Earth. They\u0027ve got all the intersystem transports screened. If you can keep low for the next seven days, you\u0027re made.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" Anderton demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFleming let go of him. Cautiously, he moved to the entrance of the alley and peered out. The first police car had come to rest on the damp pavement; its motor spinning tinnily, it crept suspiciously toward the smouldering ruin that had been Kaplan\u0027s car. Inside the wreck the squad of men were stirring feebly, beginning to creep painfully through the tangle of steel and plastic out into the cold rain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider us a protective society,\" Fleming said softly, his plump, expressionless face shining with moisture. \"A sort of police force that watches the police. To see,\" he added, \"that everything stays on an even keel.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis thick hand shot out. Stumbling, Anderton was knocked away from him, half-falling into the shadows and damp debris that littered the alley.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Get going,\" Fleming told him sharply. \"And don\u0027t discard that packet.\" As Anderton felt his way hesitantly toward the far exit of the alley, the man\u0027s last words drifted to him. \"Study it carefully and you may still survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/265/7409.html","bookId":363,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM"}
