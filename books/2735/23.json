I could see the guilt in his eyes, but he was still angry. “Hazel, apologize to your mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, I’m sorry, just please let me do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t say anything. Mom just sat there with her arms folded, not even looking at me. After a while, I got up and went to my room to write about Augustus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Mom and Dad tried a few times to knock on the door or whatever, but I just told them I was doing something important. It took me forever to figure out what I wanted to say, and even then I wasn’t very happy with it. Before I’d technically finished, I noticed it was 7:40, which meant that I would be late even if I didn’t change, so in the end I wore baby blue cotton pajama pants, flip-flops, and Gus’s Butler shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of the room and tried to go right past them, but my dad said, “You can’t leave the house without permission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my God, Dad. He wanted me to write him a eulogy, okay? I’ll be home every. Freaking. Night. Starting any day now, okay?” That finally shut them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the entire drive to calm down about my parents. I pulled up around the back of the church and parked in the semicircular driveway behind Augustus’s car. The back door to the church was held open by a fist-size rock. Inside, I contemplated taking the stairs but decided to wait for the ancient creaking elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the elevator doors unscrolled, I was in the Support Group room, the chairs arranged in the same circle. But now I saw only Gus in a wheelchair, ghoulishly thin. He was facing me from the center of the circle. He’d been waiting for the elevator doors to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hazel Grace,” he said, “you look ravishing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a shuffling in a dark corner of the room. Isaac stood behind a little wooden lectern, clinging to it. “You want to sit?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m about to eulogize. You’re late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re . . . I’m . . . what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus gestured for me to sit. I pulled a chair into the center of the circle with him as he spun the chair to face Isaac. “I want to attend my funeral,” Gus said. “By the way, will you speak at my funeral?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, of course, yeah,” I said, letting my head fall onto his shoulder. I reached across his back and hugged both him and the wheelchair. He winced. I let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awesome,” he said. “I’m hopeful I’ll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I’d—well, not to put you on the spot, but I just this afternoon thought I could arrange a prefuneral, and I figured since I’m in reasonably good spirits, there’s no time like the present.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you even get in here?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you believe they leave the door open all night?” Gus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, no,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As well you shouldn’t.” Gus smiled. “Anyway, I know it’s a bit self-aggrandizing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you’re stealing my eulogy,” Isaac said. “My first bit is about how you were a self-aggrandizing bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay,” Gus said. “At your leisure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac cleared his throat. “Augustus Waters was a self-aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his literal one sucked, or because he knew more about how to hold a cigarette than any nonsmoker in history, or because he got eighteen years when he should have gotten more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seventeen,” Gus corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m assuming you’ve got some time, you interrupting bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m telling you,” Isaac continued, “Augustus Waters talked so much that he’d interrupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious: Sweet Jesus Christ, that kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphorical resonances of human waste production. And he was vain: I do not believe I have ever met a more physically attractive person who was more acutely aware of his own physical attractiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world without him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was kind of crying by then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then, having made my rhetorical point, I will put my robot eyes on, because I mean, with robot eyes you can probably see through girls’ shirts and stuff. Augustus, my friend, Godspeed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugustus nodded for a while, his lips pursed, and then gave Isaac a thumbs-up. After he’d recovered his composure, he added, “I would cut the bit about seeing through girls’ shirts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac was still clinging to the lectern. He started to cry. He pressed his forehead down to the podium and I watched his shoulders shake, and then finally, he said, “Goddamn it, Augustus, editing your own eulogy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus,” Gus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamn it,” Isaac said again. He raised his head and swallowed. “Hazel, can I get a hand here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d forgotten he couldn’t make his own way back to the circle. I got up, placed his hand on my arm, and walked him slowly back to the chair next to Gus where I’d been sitting. Then I walked up to the podium and unfolded the piece of paper on which I’d printed my eulogy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Hazel. Augustus Waters was the great star-crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won’t be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. Gus knew. Gus knows. I will not tell you our love story, because—like all real love stories—it will die with us, as it should. I’d hoped that he’d be eulogizing me, because there’s no one I’d rather have . . .” I started crying. “Okay, how not to cry. How am I—okay. Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a few breaths and went back to the page. “I can’t talk about our love story, so I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There’s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I’m likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I’m grateful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugustus Waters died eight days after his prefuneral, at Memorial, in the ICU, when the cancer, which was made of him, finally stopped his heart, which was also made of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was with his mom and dad and sisters. His mom called me at three thirty in the morning. I’d known, of course, that he was going. I’d talked to his dad before going to bed, and he told me, “It could be tonight,” but still, when I grabbed the phone from the bedside table and saw Gus’s Mom on the caller ID, everything inside of me collapsed. She was just crying on the other end of the line, and she told me she was sorry, and I said I was sorry, too, and she told me that he was unconscious for a couple hours before he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents came in then, looking expectant, and I just nodded and they fell into each other, feeling, I’m sure, the harmonic terror that would in time come for them directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Isaac, who cursed life and the universe and God Himself and who said where are the goddamned trophies to break when you need them, and then I realized there was no one else to call, which was the saddest thing. The only person I really wanted to talk to about Augustus Waters’s death was Augustus Waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents stayed in my room forever until it was morning and finally Dad said, “Do you want to be alone?” and I nodded and Mom said, “We’ll be right outside the door,” me thinking, I don’t doubt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unbearable. The whole thing. Every second worse than the last. I just kept thinking about calling him, wondering what would happen, if anyone would answer. In the last weeks, we’d been reduced to spending our time together in recollection, but that was not nothing: The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we’d done were less real and important than they had been hours before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is to rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them. I’d been asked this question hundreds of times over the years, and I remember once early on when I couldn’t get my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body, my parents took me to the ER. A nurse asked me about the pain, and I couldn’t even speak, so I held up nine fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, after they’d given me something, the nurse came in and she was kind of stroking my hand while she took my blood pressure and she said, “You know how I know you’re a fighter? You called a ten a nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn’t quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I did call him. His phone rang five times and then went to voice mail. “You’ve reached the voice mail of Augustus Waters,” he said, the clarion voice I’d fallen for. “Leave a message.” It beeped. The dead air on the line was so eerie. I just wanted to go back to that secret post-terrestrial third space with him that we visited when we talked on the phone. I waited for that feeling, but it never came: The dead air on the line was no comfort, and finally I hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my laptop out from under the bed and fired it up and went onto his wall page, where already the condolences were flooding in. The most recent one said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, bro. See you on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . Written by someone I’d never heard of. In fact, almost all the wall posts, which arrived nearly as fast as I could read them, were written by people I’d never met and whom he’d never spoken about, people who were extolling his various virtues now that he was dead, even though I knew for a fact they hadn’t seen him in months and had made no effort to visit him. I wondered if my wall would look like this if I died, or if I’d been out of school and life long enough to escape widespread memorialization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss you already, bro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, Augustus. God bless and keep you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll live forever in our hearts, big man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(That particularly galled me, because it implied the immortality of those left behind: You will live forever in my memory, because I will live forever! I AM YOUR GOD NOW, DEAD BOY! I OWN YOU! Thinking you won’t die is yet another side effect of dying.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were always such a great friend I’m sorry I didn’t see more of you after you left school, bro. I bet you’re already playing ball in heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined the Augustus Waters analysis of that comment: If I am playing basketball in heaven, does that imply a physical location of a heaven containing physical basketballs? Who makes the basketballs in question? Are there less fortunate souls in heaven who work in a celestial basketball factory so that I can play? Or did an omnipotent God create the basketballs out of the vacuum of space? Is this heaven in some kind of unobservable universe where the laws of physics don’t apply, and if so, why in the hell would I be playing basketball when I could be flying or reading or looking at beautiful people or something else I actually enjoy? It’s almost as if the way you imagine my dead self says more about you than it says about either the person I was or the whatever I am now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis parents called around noon to say the funeral would be in five days, on Saturday. I pictured a church packed with people who thought he liked basketball, and I wanted to puke, but I knew I had to go, since I was speaking and everything. When I hung up, I went back to reading his wall:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust heard that Gus Waters died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Rest in peace, buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew these people were genuinely sad, and that I wasn’t really mad at them. I was mad at the universe. Even so, it infuriated me: You get all these friends just when you don’t need friends anymore. I wrote a reply to his comment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe live in a universe devoted to the creation, and eradication, of awareness. Augustus Waters did not die after a lengthy battle with cancer. He died after a lengthy battle with human consciousness, a victim—as you will be—of the universe’s need to make and unmake all that is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI posted it and waited for someone to reply, refreshing over and over again. Nothing. My comment got lost in the blizzard of new posts. Everyone was going to miss him so much. Everyone was praying for his family. I remembered Van Houten’s letter: Writing does not resurrect. It buries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, I went out into the living room to sit with my parents and watch TV. I couldn’t tell you what the show was, but at some point, my mom said, “Hazel, what can we do for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I just shook my head. I started crying again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can we do?” Mom asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she kept asking, as if there were something she could do, until finally I just kind of crawled across the couch into her lap and my dad came over and held my legs really tight and I wrapped my arms all the way around my mom’s middle and they held on to me for hours while the tide rolled in. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fault-in-our-stars/page-23.html","bookId":2735,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:56 PM"}
