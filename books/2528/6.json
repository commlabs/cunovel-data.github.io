He watched his wife move between the sink and the dishwasher, the counter television blaring a sitcom. He glanced up toward the ceiling, willing away sudden tears. The sound of heavy metal was coming from his son\u0027s room. Robert would go deaf by twenty, he mused, then sadness chased away the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the scientist had briefly detained him, he knew for sure that his children would outlive him, no matter what statistics proved. He was a cop; he knew he might die young. His family was supposed to be inviolate. This was a perversion of the way things were meant to be. He closed his eyes to fight back the tears and listened for his daughter\u0027s voice, already knowing that Kristin was on the telephone with one of her girl friends. It pained him to think of the trauma he was about to visit upon them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis attention returned to his wife. She looked so pretty in her wrinkled khaki capri pants, her pink T-shirt, and little white sneakers. Marjorie was a pretty woman, still, at forty-two. Sure they\u0027d had their ups and downs, but he still loved her smile, the way her eyes crinkled at the corners when she smiled... her form was rounder, softer these days, but it was also comforting and matched his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she continued to bend and pivot and rinse dinner dishes, he found himself drawn to her. He watched the setting sun glisten in her short blond hair, and then reached out to cup her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, holding a dripping dish midair. \"What\u0027s wrong, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set the dish down carefully, her eyes searching his face. \"No one died at work, did they? Your new partner...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head no and tucked a wisp of hair behind her ear. \"No. Everything and everyone at work is fine. I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you... how much I love you.\" He smiled. \"Why don\u0027t you make me and the kids help you out more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie chuckled, and began working on clearing out the sink beside him. \"Because it\u0027s easier not to fight with you guys and just get it done myself.\" She kissed his cheek. \"Some battles you learn, over the years, are not worth the energy.\" She offered him a sly pout. \"So, either you\u0027re angling for a second Wednesday night this week, or you just bought some more electronic gizmos that this house doesn\u0027t need. Which is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast his gaze out past the breakfast nook to the sliding glass doors. How did a man protect his family from the night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t buy any more stuff, and I\u0027m getting used to rations,\" he said, trying to tease her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, ho, ho... Very funny, Mr. Berkfield. You might have to get used to sleeping on the sofa, if you don\u0027t watch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laughter and the twinkle in her eyes made him know what he had to do. It broke his heart to steal her joy, but he wanted them all to survive. Even if this scientist had been wrong and was just a nutcase, it was better that his family not be around until he figured it out. Yet, the fact that the scientist had seen the same things he\u0027d seen made him slow to judge the man as a lunatic. Deciding to err on the side of caution, Berkfield took his time to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marj,\" he said quietly, in a tone that stilled her mirth, \"I need you and the kids to tell people that you\u0027re going to visit your sister in Iowa for a while. There\u0027s this priest I met, uh... a Father Patrick that I need you to stay with for a bit.\" He waited until his wife nervously nodded. \"Remember after what happened in the alley, I told you he came to me while I was looking for that guy, Rivera? If something happens to me, you and the kids will be safe with him. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught the glass that was in her hand before it fell to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are some men I put away, years ago... I want you and the kids to lay low until it gets sorted out. I don\u0027t want you to go with anybody except the priest. I don\u0027t even want any of the guys at the office to know where you are, in case there\u0027s another bad apple in the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched tears fill her pretty blue-green eyes; he almost couldn\u0027t breathe as she wrapped one arm around her waist and covered her mouth. He stared at her glistening tears, loving how one eye seemed blue and one seemed green. It was as though he needed to recall every facet of her in great detail and brand the memory of it into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew this would happen one day,\" she whispered. \"You\u0027ve put so many criminals away...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched his cheek and he drew her into an embrace, burying his face against her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The children...\" Her voice faltered and he hugged her tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only trust that priest. Only him,\" he said, firmly holding her back from him to look into her eyes. There was no way in the world he would entrust the lives of his family to some unknown group of mad scientists that had abducted him and threatened him in his own driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When my old partner went bad, Father Pat came to me and told me a lot of things were happening around Carlos Rivera that I didn\u0027t understand. But he\u0027s a man of the cloth, and he said if Rivera\u0027s word ever got shaky or if he was compromised, to come to him immediately for safe harbor. He\u0027s linked to the Vatican, and they have resources that can keep you safe and comfortable until this all blows over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going with us, right? You aren\u0027t staying here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cradled his wife in his arms and kissed the crown of her head. \"No, honey. I have to bring closure to this thing, and I want you and the kids safe until this is finished. I\u0027ll be all right. Just go with the priest, tonight. Call a few girlfriends and spread the word that you\u0027re visiting relatives, and then make the call. I\u0027ll joke around with the guys about hanging out for beers while you and the kids are in Iowa. I want everyone to think everything is fine, got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t trust anyone in the department? No one?\" Her eyes scanned his face as tears streaked her ashen cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerkfield kissed his cross then kissed her lips fast. \"No. Your mouth to God\u0027s ear, you are going to visit your sister tonight, with the kids. Make the calls, get the bags from the garage that I always told you to keep ready, and drive. You get in the car and dial the priest\u0027s number - memorize it when I give it to you. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie only nodded, obviously too traumatized to speak. Her stricken expression cut into his conscience. What if this was all pure insanity? He\u0027d made his wife memorize safe-house numbers, keep clothes in a garage to escape at a moment\u0027s notice as though they were fugitives. He\u0027d run drills with his children to keep them readied... all the while telling them that mobsters were the culprit, that his job had hazards that could spill over to them... but he\u0027d never imagined the danger would be vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d vowed to give the Guardians the early part of the evening to purge Damali, but Carlos knew it would be impossible to make it through the entire night without going to her. Still, there were security issues that he had to address, if he was going to keep her safe. That reality held him steady, honed his focus to razor clarity. It was about finding the motherfucker that had breeched his borders and had put his woman at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the earth opened and the swirling blackness died down, Carlos stood on the front grounds of his Beverly Hills lair, huge chains wrapped around both fists, a beast at either side of him, straining to break free of their leads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chill,\" he said firmly, his head tilting. He heard it, too. Damali\u0027s bloodcurdling screams slammed into his brain. Not a good sign. The sound agitated the hounds, but it drove a spike through his skull. The Guardians were not confining his baby; they were torturing the living shit out of her! The only relief was that they hadn\u0027t dusted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos closed his eyes. He had to give them time to work on her. He had to ignore her call. She had to ride it out to become human again. Only his council-level status gave him the wherewithal to resist her cries, but even that power was questionable. He let his breath out slowly and wound the chains in his fist tighter. It was about caring for her enough to let her live the way she was intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced the dogs to heel, giving them a hard tug by their chains, and began walking the perimeter of his grounds with them so they\u0027d know the borders that they were confined within. \"Not the postman, not the cops, not a kid chasing a ball - only I feed you,\" he muttered as he walked the monsters, noting how they snarled, sniffed, and occasionally looked at him confused when Damali\u0027s voice pierced their senses. \"I know,\" he said, dropping the chains and stroking their ugly heads to calm them. \"It\u0027s fucking me up, too. Stay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more aggressive of the two animals growled low in his throat and walked in a circle, going from the edge of the land back to Carlos, but then settled down. He had to feed these creatures�go find a miscellaneous vamp or local demon so the animals could get a topside feed on, even though they\u0027d fed well on the way up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had sent a serious message within all the lower levels he\u0027d passed, and the news was out, couriers were on notice. Every region was now aware that a council master was going topside and was taking no prisoners, if crossed. Courier ranks stood aghast as he donated a few of them to the cause of proving his point. Even the were-realms were giving him wide berth. The little stop down there garnered respect with Hell-dogs at his heels. And every region knew that council masters didn\u0027t do topside, unless there was a serious mission at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the other issue was he had to do something, anything, to get the sound of Damali\u0027s cries out of his mind. As her voice escalated, he gave his dogs a hard glare. \"Conceal. Stay. Guard.\" He watched them sulk away, dematerializing as they took winged flight and bent the top branches of a mature oak tree as their lookout post. Only their glowing eyes told him where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood Music made the most sense as a primary feeding ground, to his way of thinking - it had been the epicenter of Nuit\u0027s territory. The hounds would get the scent from Nuit\u0027s tracer in the meat, and any old dons left, rebels, or human operatives marked from that region, would be blocked from ambushing him. So, he went there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening,\" Carlos said with a calm smile as he materialized in the plush outer lobby of Blood\u0027s sixty-sixth-floor penthouse. He remembered being brought here when first turned... ironic how life... and death could be. At the bottom one minute, at the top the next, but wasn\u0027t the promise that in the last days, the first should be last and the last should be first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied the sumptuous leather seating, dark marble along the walls, and the huge reception desk of the same materials, bearing the Blood Music insignia crest and logo - that would have to go. So would a few of the tired human artists on the label. But all things in good time. Too hasty a move would further alert the four topside masters, and unfortunately, Nuit\u0027s music empire was still producing plenty of negative results for the vamp nation. It was already tense in the empire, given that a councilman had not elected to stay seated on a subterranean throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he moved toward the front desk, the pale, willowy vamp receptionist at the front desk blanched and held her breath for a moment before responding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master Rivera, uh, oh, a... good evening. We didn\u0027t know you were coming or when you\u0027d want your new offices readied.\" She jumped up from her desk, and hit the console. \"We\u0027ll have that immediately rectified, sir. How can I make you comfortable in the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want a board meeting of all my vice presidents, now, in the war room.\" He smiled at her more broadly and gave her a wink. \"You can chill. Only top brass changes in a hostile takeover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got a bad feeling, man,\" Stack said, peering around the new additions to Club Vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie only nodded and continued to sip his drink. Downing it quickly, he ordered another round for himself and his partner. \"Two Chivas, double color. Top shelf,\" he told the bartender without glancing up, waiting as the bartender mixed liquor and blood. He knew Rivera was close. The hair on his neck was crackling with electricity. Every curly strand of his Afro felt like it was on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccepting his drink, he suddenly stood as he watched Stack nearly topple his short rocks glass when he knocked back the shot and set the drink down hard. \"It\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStack was slow to get up and follow him. Yonnie brushed past the eager females that greeted them as they cut a swath through the frenetic club crowd. Almost as quickly as their popularity had been ignited, he could feel it wane as he wound his way up the spiral staircase and crossed the first floor on his way to Carlos\u0027s old office. The females in the club had their line of vision trained on the boss\u0027s VIP booth. Furious energy radiated from it nearly twenty-five yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatchu gonna tell him, man?\" Stack whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The truth, and beg for mercy,\" Yonnie said, no quiver in his tone, his gaze straight ahead, his pace steady as they walked. \"If we bullshit him that\u0027s a sure death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeads turned slowly as they passed. All eyes were trained upon the two young lieutenants walking toward the booth. The music seemed to get quieter as they approached. The entire club froze, then gasps rippled through the room as two Hell-dogs appeared and snarled to stop Yonnie and Stack\u0027s approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen,\" Carlos said, materializing out of a beam of blue club light. \"I like what you\u0027ve done with the establishment.\" He stroked the heads of his beasts and snapped his fingers twice, commanding the dogs to sit, and then extended his crest ring for Yonnie and Stack to kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We added a new subterranean level,\" Stack said quickly, bowing and stepping back from Carlos after appropriately acknowledging his rank. \"While you were gone, we converted the basement level for VIPs so the club can stay open twenty-four hours without a light intrusion. It\u0027s fully stocked with top-shelf and the territory\u0027s best females.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos nodded and smoothed the front of his black Armani suit, his gaze sweeping the club floor. His line of vision settled on Yonnie, who looked him square in the eyes. He liked that. A man with courage. A man of few words, wise enough to hold his counsel until he was asked to speak. Carlos smiled. The collective tension in the establishment abated. The music resumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walk with me, Yonnie. Let\u0027s have a conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie nodded and neared Carlos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppearing relieved, Stack stepped away from his partner\u0027s side, his eyes holding an expression of pity. Carlos watched Yonnie stiffen from the corner of his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feed the dogs,\" Carlos ordered as they left Stack. \"They require a hundred and eighty pounds of meat. Take it from the old inventory in the freezer. I want that bullshit out of my club, understood? Only top-shelf from Nuit\u0027s old holding in here, but no new bodies.\" He glanced at the dogs, angry that he didn\u0027t consider feeding them the leftovers from Blood Music. Carlos resumed walking with Yonnie a few paces behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed the stairs to Carlos\u0027s old office, and for a bit, nostalgia settled into Carlos\u0027s bones. He approached two bulked security vamps who parted for them to pass. The good old days, when he was alive and this club had been the crown jewel of his human empire. So much had changed in such a short time, and he\u0027d learned just how relative time was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos took in his environment, walking around the spacious room, remembering, and fingering objects on his old mahogany desk. The room now seemed so small, so plain, compared to what he\u0027d experienced since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit,\" he bade Yonnie, as he found his old high-back leather chair and sat in it. He was amazed at how ordinary it felt in comparison to his council throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Yonnie didn\u0027t sit. He stood before the wide desk, his eyes glittering with both fear and respect as he stared at Carlos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, we have a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos laced his fingers together and made a tent. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philadelphia was a disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight smile tugged at Carlos\u0027s mouth as he stared at the young vampire. Yonnie couldn\u0027t have been more than eighteen years old when he turned. He wasn\u0027t concerned about Philadelphia. But he was aware of the strong Guardian nest that had been uncovered there. Perverse amusement filled him. He now understood the chairman\u0027s reactions to his visits to council chambers. So he waited, gathering the patience to watch how Yonnie would function when there was bad news to deliver to the boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got blindsided there,\" Yonnie said, his expression stoic, but the beads of perspiration forming on his brow gave away his calm exterior. \"We\u0027ll go back and address it, will root out all Guardian teams in your territories. Our resources had been strained - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos held up his hand. \"Let the Guardian teams, wherever you find them, be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie blinked twice. \"Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strategy,\" Carlos said, his gaze assessing every inch of the young vampire. \"When their side gets that strong, it\u0027s because our side has kicked up a notch. If Guardian teams are flooding my zones, then it stands to reason that the light has picked up on more than me in the area.\" Carlos\u0027s smile disappeared as Yonnie\u0027s body swayed. \"This is why I asked you to have a seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie nodded and sat slowly, his attention riveted to Carlos. \"You were breached by another master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Appears so,\" Carlos murmured, renewed fury making his incisors lower a half inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take him,\" Yonnie said quickly. He stood again and began pacing, his agitation creating a crackle of electricity throughout the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your men couldn\u0027t take a well-fortified Guardian team,\" Carlos said in a blase tone. \"You\u0027re third-gens, and that\u0027s my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie stopped pacing and horror filled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos shook his head and stood. \"I should\u0027ve had seconds in there watching my back.\" He began walking in a wide circle around Yonnie. As he watched pure terror reflect back at him from the vampire\u0027s young face, an old wound opened inside him. Alejandro should have been here. Julio should have been here. Miguel should have been here, just like all the others should have. \"All my family is gone... all my old hombres, at a time when I need them most.\" Carlos chuckled, and a sad, hollow sound echoed throughout the room. \"Fate is a curious thing. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d survive this long without them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and stood before Yonnie. He reached out and placed a hand on Yonnie\u0027s shoulder. He wasn\u0027t surprised when Yonnie closed his eyes, resigned to his fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you, man?\" Carlos asked, his voice low and gentle. It hurt him that Yonnie was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was turned at eighteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your eyes. Talk to me. How long ago were you turned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeming surprised, Yonnie opened his eyes. A silent understanding connected them. They both knew that Carlos could have dredged him for the information, but hadn\u0027t invaded his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Respect,\" Carlos murmured. \"Some things, between men, are just not done.\" He dropped his hold on Yonnie\u0027s shoulder and appraised his light almond complexion, wiry light brown Afro, and hazel eyes. \"You\u0027ve got a Southern accent,\" Carlos said, leaving Yonnie and walking to the far side of the room toward the bar. He studied his old crystal decanter, which was now filled with blood, and poured a half goblet, offering one to Yonnie. \"You ever miss your living family?\" Carlos asked, extending the tumbler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie accepted the glass and took a shaky sip, his eyes never leaving Carlos\u0027s. \"They\u0027re all dead by now,\" he admitted quietly. \"I was made just before Nuit overthrew my master. A lot has changed in the world since then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntrigued, Carlos stared at Yonnie, as the vampire polished off his drink and set the glass down carefully on the edge of Carlos\u0027s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was in the plantation days,\" Yonnie said slowly. \"You cannot imagine what those days were like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos nodded. That was the stark truth, if ever he\u0027d heard it. He didn\u0027t know much about this kid, but he did know an honest man when he saw one. But the irony of it all was not lost on him. In human terms, Yonnie was most likely two hundred years his senior, but in vampire terms, because he was a third-gen, he was a junior ranking officer now in his camp. Twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotchure back, man,\" Yonnie said in a quiet voice. His eyes searched Carlos\u0027s as he spoke. \"I got into this by accident... it was more like a dupe. Had heard your turn went down like that, too. All of us from the old generation were rooting for you in that drag race, brother. We wanted to see one of our own, somebody who\u0027d been played get the upper hand. So, when you came out holdin\u0027 aces, it was one of the proudest moments in my vamp life - and that\u0027s no bullshit. Go \u0027head, scan me, test me, but I mean what I\u0027m saying, no matter how this night ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotion filled Carlos, but he kept that locked within him. He could appreciate where Yonnie was coming from, and didn\u0027t need a mental probe to test for authenticity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout fear, Yonnie stepped closer to him. His gaze locked with Carlos\u0027s, and Carlos could feel the invitation to peer into his mind. He nodded his acceptance of the offer and allowed his hand to again rest on Yonnie\u0027s shoulder. Horrible images filled his inner vision. A pretty, ebony-skinned young slave woman raped and brutalized by barbaric overseers. An almond-colored baby born and snatched from her arms, while she was forced to work. A child abused and beaten when it cried for its mother. A tender caress in the dead of night to soothe a frightened little boy... who became a man that ran into the woods one night to find a way to save his momma from her misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears streamed down Yonnie\u0027s face. Carlos closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told me that this old woman knew a man with power...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stepped away from Yonnie and nodded, not sure that his dead heart could withstand the story he knew too well. \"And he promised you power like you\u0027d never imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie simply nodded, then drew a ragged breath. \"I wanted to get them back for what they\u0027d done to us. I wanted to give all my boys the chance to live forever and to be strong. Two of them had tried to run and go north, but Alabama was a long way from the Mason-Dixon. They dragged them back, strung them up, and burned them alive for us all to see. That night I stole away and got made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it wasn\u0027t what you thought it would be,\" Carlos said flatly. \"It never is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie wiped his face and nodded. \"No, brother. It\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stack\u0027s been with you since then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Yonnie replied, drained. \"All my boys were made by me. That\u0027s the tragedy.\" He quickly looked up, becoming tense. All vampires knew it was forbidden to speak ill of the eternal dark life, and he\u0027d admitted his displeasure to a councilman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s cool, man,\" Carlos said with a wave of his hand. He sat on the edge of his desk, emotionally spent. \"This shit is not what it\u0027s cracked up to be, even at my level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, a silent understanding bound them as they stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it is what it is,\" Carlos finally said. \"We are where we are, and what we are. So, the only option is to make the best of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie nodded and found his empty chair and slumped in it. \"After two hundred years, man, there are some nights when it all seems like it was yesterday. Then, there are some nights when it seems like it will never end.\" He laughed sadly. \"And it won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos rubbed his jaw, hearing everything Yonnie had said. He was only a year old in his vampire life, and already it had been too long. He could only imagine the boredom and pure agony of hundreds of years of existence... and the master vampires who were very old had that reality as their Achilles\u0027 heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Carlos said, his voice a low murmur, \"as a councilman, there are some wrongs I can right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie stared at him, new tension ebbing back into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need men I can depend on, men who died with honorable intent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie had stopped breathing. Carlos stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My borders are shaky; another master has come into my territory and poached it.\" Carlos walked to stand before Yonnie and motioned for him to stand. \"If you don\u0027t know anything else about me, you know I ain\u0027t having that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t expect you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have certain rules about how I handle my business.\" Carlos stared at Yonnie hard. \"No women and children. No elderly. No innocents. It\u0027s a long story, but it has to do with how I was made and who\u0027s still under my mark. It has everything to do with how they half ate my brother when they turned him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonnie nodded. \"Nuit\u0027s bite was nasty, man. We all hid from him. You ain\u0027t got no problem from us. Where we came from, none of us has the stomach for babies and old folks... hate seeing sisters diced up and left on the morgue slabs. What humans have done is worse than what we\u0027ve ever imagined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I want the dead meat out of my freezers. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t want any more floor shows with underage chicks. I want all my establishments run on the up and up, like we\u0027re going legit - so the humans don\u0027t swarm us. Top-shelf is siphoned from willing human donors only, already compromised motherfuckers who have lost their souls while still alive - and there\u0027s enough of them walking the planet to fill vats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it. We stay off radar until the heat dies down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos extended his hand to Yonnie. And when he accepted it, Carlos pulled him in close. He studied the junior vampire\u0027s jugular and waited until Yonnie threw his head back in submission. \"You ready for a demotion to second-level, man... with the power to deliver this to your boys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears of admiration filled Yonnie\u0027s eyes as he choked out the word, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make \u0027em all seconds with you,\" Carlos whispered as his fangs lowered to a deadly eight inches. \"Do it tonight. After that, your bites will make thirds, and unless I sanction the turn, you make none without my permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel Yonnie trembling as he held him in a steel embrace. Yonnie swallowed hard, on the verge of weeping as a current passed through them. \"I\u0027d always wished... but never dared dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Carlos crooned. \"With this bite I give you the flight pattern to my lairs - guard them well. Watch my back. Protect my woman. Protect her family. Honor my strategy. Never question my judgment. Bring me information about which master has been in my yard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done,\" Yonnie murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike was so swift that Yonnie\u0027s knees buckled. The shock of energy transfer coursed through the room, toppling chairs, shattering glass, and eliciting a garbled groan of pleasure from the junior vampire. Years of Yonnie\u0027s torment entered Carlos and fused with his own, making Carlos\u0027s hands tremble as he siphoned away the pain and wrapped it in a pleasure bond. Prisms of dancing lights formed beneath Carlos\u0027s lids as he made his first lieutenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinded, he dropped Yonnie to a chair and staggered away from him, torn. Part of him knew that the power transfer was a necessary evil to shore up his territory, but another side of him was deeply troubled. The pleasure that came from such power was nearly maddening. Now that he\u0027d learned what it was like, he wondered if he\u0027d ever be able to give up this new, dark life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought the back of his hand to his mouth and dabbed away the black blood. He stared at Yonnie, who was prone, breathing heavily, eyes closed, as though he\u0027d just been with a lover. The image disturbed Carlos and he crossed the room for much-needed space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout turning around he knew the vampire was slowly opening his eyes, which now glowed red. He watched Yonnie stretch out his arms and stare at the blue-black electric current running down them. Instantly, Yonnie stood and walked around in a circle, becoming giddy, almost as though he were high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I descended,\" Yonnie said, laughing. \"Oh, shit, you made me, man! I\u0027m your first lieutenant - Carlos Rivera\u0027s first lieutenant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos poured a drink and downed it, his tone even, his nerves shattered. \"Yeah, man. Congratulations. Go celebrate.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bitten-vampire-huntress-legend-4/page-6.html","bookId":2528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:52 PM"}
