{"id":697,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER V TIDD versus RENSHAW","content":"The head of a big office or business house cannot move out of his orbit without creating perturbations. Brownlow, the head clerk and second in command of the Pettigrew business, was to learn this fact to his cost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Brownlow was a man of forty-five, whose habits and ideas seemed regulated by clockwork. He lived at Hampstead with his wife and three children, and went each day to the office. That was the summary of his life as read by an outsider. Often the bald statement covers everything. It almost did in the case of Brownlow. He had no initiative. He kept things together, he was absolutely perfect in routine, he had a profound knowledge of the law, he was correct, a good husband and a good father, but he had no initiative, and, outside of the law, very little knowledge of the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Imagine this correct gentleman, then, seated at his desk on the morning of the day after that on which Simon made his poaching [Pg 222]arrangements with Horn. He was turning over some papers when Balls, the second in command, came in. Balls was young and wore eyeglasses and had ambitions. He and Brownlow were old friends, and when together talked as equals.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve had that James man just in to see me,\" said Balls. \"Same old game; wanted to see Pettigrew. He knows I have the whole thread of the case in my hands, but that\u0027s nothing to him, he wants to see Pettigrew.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know,\" said Brownlow. \"I\u0027ve had the same bother. They will see the head.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When\u0027s he back?\" asked Balls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Brownlow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where\u0027s he gone?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Brownlow. \"I only know he\u0027s gone, same as this time last year. He was a month away then.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Lord!\" said Balls, who had only joined the office nine months before and who knew nothing of last year\u0027s escapade. \"A month more of this sort of bother—a month!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Brownlow. \"I had it to do last year, and he left no address, same as now.\" Then, after a moment\u0027s pause, \"I\u0027m worried about him. I can\u0027t help it, there was a strange thing happened last year. I\u0027ve never told it to a soul before. He called me in one day to his[Pg 223] room and he showed me a bundle of bank-notes. \u0027See here, Brownlow,\u0027 said he, \u0027did you put these in my safe?\u0027 I\u0027d never seen the things before and I have no key to his private safe. I told him I hadn\u0027t. He showed me the notes, ten thousand pounds\u0027 worth. Ten thousand pounds\u0027 worth, he couldn\u0027t account for—asked me if I\u0027d put them in his safe. I said \u0027No,\u0027 as I told you. \u0027Well, it\u0027s very strange,\u0027 said he. Then he stood looking at the floor. Then he said all of a sudden, \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 Next day he went off on a month\u0027s holiday, sending word for me to carry on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Queer,\" said Balls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"More than queer,\" replied Brownlow. \"I\u0027ve put it down to mental strain; he\u0027s a hard worker.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not mental strain,\" said Balls. \"He\u0027s as alive as you or me and as keen, and he doesn\u0027t overwork; it\u0027s something else.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I wish it would stop,\" said Brownlow, \"for I\u0027m nearly worried to death with clients writing to see him and trying to invent excuses, and my work is doubled.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So\u0027s mine,\" said Balls. He went out and Brownlow continued his business. He had not been engaged on it for long when Morgan, the office-boy, appeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Tidd, sir, to see Mr. Pettigrew.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Show him in,\" said Brownlow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later Mr. Tidd appeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Tidd was a small, slight, old-maidish man; he walked lightly, like a bird, and carried a tall hat with a black band in one hand and a tightly-folded umbrella in the other. Incidentally he was one of Pettigrew\u0027s best clients.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good morning,\" said Mr. Tidd. \"I\u0027ve called to see Mr. Pettigrew with regard to those papers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh yes,\" said Brownlow. \"Sit down, Mr. Tidd. Those papers—Mr. Pettigrew has been considering them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is not Mr. Pettigrew in?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mr. Tidd, he\u0027s not in just at present.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When is he likely to return?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s doubtful; he has left me in charge.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The end of Mr. Tidd\u0027s nose moved uneasily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are in charge of my case?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, of the whole business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can speak confidentially?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Absolutely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I have decided to stop proceedings—in fact, I am caught in a hole.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. Mrs. Renshaw has, in some illicit[Pg 225] manner, got a document with my signature attached—a very grave document. This is strictly between ourselves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Strictly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And she threatens to use it against me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To use it against me, unless I return to her at once the letter of hers which I put in Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s keeping.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. She is a violent and very vicious woman. I have not slept all night. I live, as you perhaps know, at Hitchin. I took the first train I could conveniently catch to town this morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The horrible fact was beginning to dawn on Brownlow that Simon had not brought those papers back to the office. He said nothing; his lips, for a moment, had gone dry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How she got hold of that document with my name to it I cannot tell,\" said Mr. Tidd, \"but she will use it against me most certainly unless I return that letter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps,\" said Brownlow, recovering himself, \"perhaps she is only threatening—bluffing, as they call it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh no, she\u0027s not,\" said the other. \"If you knew her you would not say that; no, indeed,[Pg 226] you would not say that. She is the last woman to threaten what she will not perform. Till that document is in her hands I will not feel safe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must be careful,\" said Brownlow, fighting for time. \"How would it be if I were to see her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Useless,\" said Mr. Tidd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May I ask——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is the document to which your name is attached, and which is in her possession, is it—er—detrimental—I mean, plainly, is it likely to do you a grave injury?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The document,\" said Mr. Tidd, \"was written by me in a moment of impulse to a lady who is—another gentleman\u0027s wife.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a letter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it is a letter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see. Well, Mr. Tidd, your document, the one you are anxious to return in exchange for this document, is in the possession of Mr. Pettigrew; it is quite safe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Doubtless,\" said Mr. Tidd, \"but I want it in my hands to return it myself to-day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I sent it with the other papers to Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s private house,\" said Brownlow, \"and he has not yet returned it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! But I want it to-day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s very unfortunate,\" said Brownlow, \"but he\u0027s away—and I\u0027m afraid he must have taken the papers with him for consideration.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good heavens!\" said Tidd. \"But if that is so what am I to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can\u0027t wait?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can I wait?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear me, dear me,\" said Brownlow, almost driven to distraction, \"this is very unfortunate.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tidd seemed to concur.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His lips had become pale. Then he broke out: \"I placed my vital interests in the hands of Mr. Pettigrew, and now at the critical moment I find this!\" said he. \"Away! But you must find him—you must find him, and find him at once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If he had only known what he would find he might have been less eager perhaps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll find him if I can,\" said Brownlow. He rang a bell, and when Morgan appeared he sent for Balls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Balls,\" said Brownlow with a spasmodic attempt at a wink, \"can you not get Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s present address?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Balls understood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll see,\" said he. Out he went, returning in a minute.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t,\" said Balls. \"Mr. [Pg 228]Pettigrew did not leave his address when he went away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, Mr. Balls,\" said Brownlow. Then to Tidd, when they were alone: \"This is as hard for me as for you, Mr. Tidd; I can\u0027t think what to do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ve got to find him,\" said Tidd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will he by any chance have left his address at his private house?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We can see,\" said Brownlow. \"He has no telephone, but I\u0027ll go myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will go with you,\" said Tidd. \"You understand me, this is a matter of life and death—ruin—my wife—that woman, and the other one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see, I see, I see,\" said Brownlow, taking his hat from its peg on the wall. \"Come with me; we will find him if he is to be found.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He hurried out, followed by Mr. Tidd, and in Fleet Street he managed to get a taxi. They got into it and drove to King Charles Street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a long pause after the knock, and then the door opened, disclosing Mrs. Jukes. Brownlow was known to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jukes,\" said Brownlow, \"can you give me Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s present address?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir, I can\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was called away, was he not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so, sir; he went off on some business or other. Mudd has gone with him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, dear!\" said Tidd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They stopped at the Charing Cross Hotel,\" said Mrs. Jukes, \"and then I had a message they were going into the country. It was from Mr. Mudd, and he said they might be a month away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A month away!\" said Tidd, his voice strangely calm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good gracious!\" said Brownlow. Then to Tidd, \"You see how I am placed?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A month away,\" said Tidd; he seemed unable to get over that obstacle of thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Jukes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They got into the taxi and went to the Charing Cross Hotel, where they were informed that Mr. Pettigrew was gone and had left no address.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then suddenly an idea came to Brownlow—Oppenshaw. The doctor might know; failing the doctor, they were done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come with me,\" said he; \"I think I know a person who may have the address.\" He got into the taxi again with the other, gave the Harley Street address, and they drove off. The[Pg 230] horrible irregularity of the whole of this business was poisoning Brownlow\u0027s mind—hunting for the head of a firm who ought to be at his office and who held possession of a client\u0027s vitally important document.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said nothing, neither did Mr. Tidd, who was probably engaged in reviewing the facts of his case and the position his wife would take up when that letter was put into her hands by Mrs. Renshaw.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They stopped at 110A, Harley Street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, it\u0027s a doctor\u0027s house,\" said Tidd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Brownlow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They knocked at the door and were let in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The servant, in the absence of an appointment, said he would see what he could do, and showed them into the waiting-room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell Dr. Oppenshaw it is Mr. Brownlow from Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s office,\" said Brownlow, \"on very urgent business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They took their seats, and while Mr. Tidd tried to read a volume of Punch upside down, Brownlow bit his nails.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a marvellously short time the servant returned and asked Mr. Brownlow to step in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oppenshaw did not beat about the bush. When he heard what Brownlow wanted he said frankly he did not know where Mr. Pettigrew[Pg 231] was; he only knew that he had been staying at the Charing Cross Hotel. Mudd, the manservant, was with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s only right that you should know the position,\" said Oppenshaw, \"as you say you are the chief clerk and all responsibility rests on you in Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s absence.\" Then he explained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But if he\u0027s like that, where\u0027s the use of finding him?\" said the horrified Brownlow. \"A man with mind disease!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"More a malady than a disease,\" put in Oppenshaw.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but—like that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course,\" said Oppenshaw, \"he may at any moment turn back into himself again, like the finger of a glove turning inside out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps,\" said the other hopelessly, \"but till he does turn——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that moment the sound of a telephone-bell came from outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Till he does turn, of course, he\u0027s useless for business purposes,\" said Oppenshaw; \"he would have no memory, for one thing—at least, no memory of business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The servant entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Please, sir, an urgent call for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One moment,\" said Oppenshaw. Out he went.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was back in less than two minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have his address,\" said he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank goodness!\" said Brownlow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"H\u0027m,\" said Oppenshaw; \"but there\u0027s not good news with it. He\u0027s staying at the Rose Hotel, Upton-on-Hill, and he\u0027s been getting into trouble of some sort. It was Mudd who \u0027phoned, and he seemed half off his head; said he didn\u0027t like to go into details over the telephone, but wanted me to come down to arrange matters. I told him it was quite impossible to-day; then he seemed to collapse and cut me off.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What am I to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, there\u0027s only two things to be done: tell this gentleman that Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s mind is affected, or take him down there on the chance that this shock may have restored Mr. Pettigrew.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t tell him Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s mind is affected,\" said Brownlow. \"I\u0027d sooner do anything than that. I\u0027d sooner take him down there on the chance of his being better—perhaps even if he\u0027s not, the sight of me and Mr. Tidd might recall him to himself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Possibly,\" said Oppenshaw, who was in a hurry and only too glad of any chance of cutting the business short. \"Possibly. Anyhow, there[Pg 233] is some use in trying, and tell Mudd it\u0027s absolutely useless my going. I shall be glad to do anything I can by letter or telephone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Brownlow took up his hat, then he recaptured Tidd and gave him the cheering news that he had Simon\u0027s address. \"I\u0027ll go with you myself,\" said Brownlow. \"Of course, the expense will fall on the office. I must send a telegram to the office and my wife to say I won\u0027t be back to-night. We can\u0027t get to Upton till this evening. We\u0027ll have to go as we are, without even waiting to pack a bag.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That doesn\u0027t matter; that doesn\u0027t matter,\" said Tidd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were in the street now and bundling into the waiting taxi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Victoria Station,\" said Brownlow to the driver.
