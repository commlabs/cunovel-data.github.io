Why? You a friend of his?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked the question like he was inviting me to step outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s no friend of mine,” I assured him. “And if you want to kick his ass I’ll be happy to hold your coat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender’s smile returned just as quickly as it had left. “Sorry ’bout that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me freshen that for you.” He refilled my mug. “So you don’t like Crosetti, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s to like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take it he was a customer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Briefly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I ever see him again …” He shook his head bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He broke a woman’s hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the fun of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that sounds like my guy. When did you see him last?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About a week ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Know where I can find him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but—” His eyes wandered to the woman sitting alone. “Are you screwing with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You say you’re no friend of Crosetti. So why are you looking for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to hurt him just as badly as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regretted the words the moment I spoke them—I could already hear the bartender repeating them to various cops and county attorneys. But playing off his anger seemed like a good idea at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender nodded and looked again at the woman, who was looking back. “You should talk to Janel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured with his head. The woman smiled expectantly and rose from her chair. In her heels she ran to five-ten, most of it in her legs. I caught the blue in her eyes halfway across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentleman would like to speak with you,” the bartender told her when she approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would the gentleman like to speak about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Frank Crosetti.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman spun around neatly and, without a suggestion of haste, returned to her table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess she doesn’t want to talk,” said the bartender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s she drinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gimlets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring her one.” I drained the coffee and bourbon. “And another one of these.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the bar and sauntered over to the woman’s table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Janel. My name’s McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you a cop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I look like a cop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your instincts are good. I used to be one, but not anymore. May I join you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say I couldn’t, so I took the chair opposite her. She watched me suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said. I’m not a cop. I’m not a prosecutor. You have nothing to fear from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m looking for Frank Crosetti.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at her cast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I can hurt him the way he hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanel slipped the cast beneath the table as if she were suddenly embarrassed by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “F-ing Frank.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“F-ing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. But the fact that she couldn’t bring herself to say the word was strangely endearing. When I first saw her, I guessed she was a prostitute. Now I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you spend much time with Crosetti?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some. He has a house on a hill not far from here. He would invite me to go to private parties over there. Finally, I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what I mean by private parties?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we were—friends. I thought he cared about me. He said he did. He lied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender appeared, set the drinks on the table, and left. Janel picked up the fresh gimlet and drank half of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. About Crosetti, why did he break your hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was over a drink.” She looked hard at the glass in front of her, turned it slowly, then gently slid it away, but not so far she couldn’t reach it in a hurry. “He asked me to meet him here. I was late. Just a few minutes, but he was really upset about it. Said no one keeps him waiting. I said I was sorry. There was a drink in front of him, and I reached for it, to take a sip, you know, and he grabbed my hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the cast out from under the table and held it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t say anything. He just grabbed my hand and squeezed it as tightly as he could. Frank has strong hands. I heard the bones crack. Then he smashed it against the table—twice. Smashed it down hard. Broke a finger and three bones. Then he left. He never said a word. I never saw him again. We called the cops”—Janel gestured toward the bartender—“but they didn’t do anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.” I seemed to be using that word a lot lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All because I wanted a sip of his drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before this happened, did you spend much time talking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some, in the beginning. Not much after I started—you know, going to his parties. And never before the party. Frank wanted what he wanted when he wanted it. If there was any talking, it was always afterward.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-22.html","bookId":2224,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM"}
