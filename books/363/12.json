While he packed, frantic thoughts passed through his mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePossibly he was wrong about Witwer—but how could he be sure? In any event, the conspiracy against him was far more complex than he had realized. Witwer, in the over-all picture, might be merely an insignificant puppet animated by someone else—by some distant, indistinct figure only vaguely visible in the background.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a mistake to show the card to Lisa. Undoubtedly, she would describe it in detail to Witwer. He\u0027d never get off Earth, never have an opportunity to find out what life on a frontier planet might be like.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhile he was thus preoccupied, a board creaked behind him. He turned from the bed, clutching a weather-stained winter sports jacket, to face the muzzle of a gray-blue A-pistol.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t take you long,\" he said, staring with bitterness at the tight-lipped, heavyset man in a brown overcoat who stood holding the gun in his gloved hand. \"Didn\u0027t she even hesitate?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe intruder\u0027s face registered no response. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" he said. \"Come along with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Anderton laid down the sports jacket. \"You\u0027re not from my agency? You\u0027re not a police officer?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eProtesting and astonished, he was hustled outside the house to a waiting limousine. Instantly three heavily armed men closed in behind him. The door slammed and the car shot off down the highway, away from the city. Impassive and remote, the faces around him jogged with the motion of the speeding vehicle as open fields, dark and somber, swept past.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton was till trying futilely to grasp the implications of what had happened, when the car came to a rutted side road, turned off, and descended into a gloomy sub-surface garage. Someone shouted an order. The heavy metal lock grated shut and overhead lights blinked on. The driver turned off the car motor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have reason to regret this,\" Anderton warned hoarsely, as they dragged him from the car. \"Do you realize who I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We realize,\" the man in the brown overcoat said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt gun-point, Anderton was marched upstairs, from the clammy silence of the garage into a deep-carpeted hallway. He was, apparently, in a luxurious private residence, set out in the war-devoured rural area. At the far end of the hallway he could make out a room—a book-lined study simply but tastefully furnished. In a circle of lamplight, his face partly in shadows, a man he had never met sat waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs Anderton approached, the man nervously slipped a pair of rimless glasses in place, snapped the case shut, and moistened his dry lips. He was elderly, perhaps seventy or older, and under his arm was a slim silver cane. His body was thin, wiry, his attitude curiously rigid. What little hair he had was dusty brown—a carefully-smoothed sheen of neutral color above his pale, bony skull. Only his eyes seemed really alert.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this Anderton?\" he inquired querulously, turning to the man in the brown overcoat. \"Where did you pick him up?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"At his home,\" the other replied. \"He was packing—as we expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe man at the desk shivered visibly. \"Packing.\" He took off his glasses and jerkily returned them to their case. \"Look here,\" he said bluntly to Anderton, \"what\u0027s the matter with you? Are you hopelessly insane? How could you kill a man you\u0027ve never met?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe old man, Anderton suddenly realized, was Leopold Kaplan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"First, I\u0027ll ask you a question,\" Anderton countered rapidly. \"Do you realize what you\u0027ve done? I\u0027m Commissioner of Police. I can have you sent up for twenty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to say more, but a sudden wonder cut him short.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find out?\" he demanded. Involuntarily, his hand went to his pocket, where the folded card was hidden. \"It won\u0027t be for another—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t notified through your agency,\" Kaplan broke in, with angry impatience. \"The fact that you\u0027ve never heard of me doesn\u0027t surprise me too much. Leopold Kaplan, General of the Army of the Federated Westbloc Alliance.\" Begrudgingly, he added. \"Retired, since the end of the Anglo-Chinese War, and the abolishment of AFWA.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt made sense. Anderton had suspected that the Army processed its duplicate cards immediately, for its own protection. Relaxing somewhat, he demanded: \"Well? You\u0027ve got me here. What next?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidently,\" Kaplan said, \"I\u0027m not going to have you destroyed, or it would have shown up on one of those miserable little cards. I\u0027m curious about you. It seemed incredible to me that a man of your stature could contemplate the cold-blooded murder of a total stranger. There must be something more here. Frankly, I\u0027m puzzled. If it represented some kind of Police strategy-\" He shrugged his thin shoulders. \"Surely you wouldn\u0027t have permitted the duplicate card to reach us.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless,\" one of his men suggested, \"it\u0027s a deliberate plant.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKaplan raised his bright, bird-like eyes and scrutinized Anderton. \"What do you have to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s exactly what it is,\" Anderton said, quick to see the advantage of stating frankly what he believed to be the simple truth. \"The prediction on the card was deliberately fabricated by a clique inside the police agency. The card is prepared and I\u0027m netted. I\u0027m relieved of my authority automatically. My assistant steps in and claims he prevented the murder in the usual efficient Precrime manner. Needless to say, there is no murder or intent to murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with you that there will be no murder,\" Kaplan affirmed grimly. \"You\u0027ll be in police custody. I intend to make certain of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHorrified, Anderton protested: \"You\u0027re taking me back there? If I\u0027m in custody I\u0027ll never be able to prove—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you prove or don\u0027t prove,\" Kaplan interrupted. \"All I\u0027m interested in is having you out of the way.\" Frigidly, he added: \"For my own protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He was getting ready to leave,\" one of the men asserted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Anderton said, sweating. \"As soon as they get hold of me I\u0027ll be confined in the detention camp. Witwer will take over—lock, stock and barrel.\" His face darkened. \"And my wife. They\u0027re acting in concert, apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Kaplan seemed to waver. \"It\u0027s possible,\" he conceded, regarding Anderton steadily. Then he shook his head. \"I can\u0027t take the chance. If this is a frame against you, I\u0027m sorry. But it\u0027s simply not my affair.\" He smiled slightly. \"However, I wish you luck.\" To the men he said: \"Take him to the police building and turn him over to the highest authority.\" He mentioned the name of the acting commissioner, and waited for Anderton\u0027s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Witwer!\" Anderton echoed, incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStill smiling slightly, Kaplan turned and clicked on the console radio in the study. \"Witwer has already assumed authority. Obviously, he\u0027s going to create quite an affair out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief static hum, and then, abruptly, the radio blared out into the room—a noisy professional voice, reading a prepared announcement.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"... all citizens are warned not to shelter or in any fashion aid or assist this dangerous marginal individual. The extraordinary circumstance of an escaped criminal at liberty and in a position to commit an act of violence is unique in modern times. All citizens are hereby notified that legal statutes still in force implicate any and all persons failing to cooperate fully with the police in their task of apprehending John Allison Anderton. To repeat: The Precrime Agency of the Federal Westbloc Government is in the process of locating and neutralizing its former Commissioner, John Allison Anderton, who, through the methodology of the precrime-system, is hereby declared a potential murderer and as such forfeits his rights to freedom and all its privileges.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t take him long,\" Anderton muttered, appalled. Kaplan snapped off the radio and the voice vanished.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Lisa must have gone directly to him,\" Anderton speculated bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should he wait?\" Kaplan asked. \"You made your intentions clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded to his men. \"Take him back to town. I feel uneasy having him so close. In that respect I concur with Commissioner Witwer. I want him neutralized as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/265/7408.html","bookId":363,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM"}
