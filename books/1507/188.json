Normally, whether he was inside the Sect or outside, he constantly said sarcastic things about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, of course, made Wang Tengfei furious. However, there was nothing he could do about it. Offending Li Fugui was not an option. Their feud was a trifling matter of the junior generation. Furthermore, Li Fugui was too important to the Golden Frost Sect. The difference between Li Fugui’s importance to the Golden Frost Sect and Wang Teng Fei’s importance to the Wang clan, was immeasurable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFatty suddenly leaped up onto the table, to the embarrassment of his fellow Golden Frost Sect members. They could do little more than cough lightly and watch as he cried out, “Ah, true love. Fellow Daoists, could I really not see such a thing? It was definitely true love. How could I, Li Fugui, do anything to split apart such an affectionate couple? Would I really do that, just for my good-for-nothing friend Wang Tengfei? Would I really disturb a scene of true love? Never! I could never do such a thing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a saying which speaks of a love that can transcend something-or-other, I forgot. Anyway, someone told me something once. Actually, it was the best friend I’ve ever had, the person I admire most in the world. He told me that love is the most valuable thing in the world, worth more than even millions of Spirit Stones!” As he spoke, his mouthful of extraordinarily large teeth became visible. In the end, he began to choke up and started to cry aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing this caused the Song Clan members to smile wryly. The Blood Demon Sect Cultivators eyed Fatty with strange expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Shiqi frowned, but didn’t say anything. Wang Youcai also maintained his silence, although a slight smile appeared on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore,” continued Fatty, growing more and more excited, “I pretended that I didn’t even see them. However, it left me with the feeling that Wang Tengfei is really a useless nobody. Furthermore, he\u0027s completely shameless. Anyone could see that it was true love. Were I in Wang Tengfei’s place, I would simply smile, and hand over the beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That unknown Cultivator, in terms of appearance, of Cultivation base, of everything, is clearly above and beyond Wang Tengfei. Sadly…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, an infuriated shout could be heard from mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“LI FUGUI!!!” Killing intent roiled out from Wang Tengfei as he shot out from the group floating in the air. His entire body was like a sharpened sword slicing toward Li Fugui.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could get very close, the Golden Frost Sect disciples behind Li Fugui leaped up with amazing speed. In the blink of an eye, they shot forward. One of them, a tall, strapping man, let out a cold harrumph and formed a fist, which he lifted into the air. Ripples spread out from it in all directions, and a roaring sound filled the air. Wang Tengfei’s facial expression flickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang Xifan exploded out with incredible speed. In an instant, he was in front of Wang Tengfei, waving both hands out forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom echoed out. The blood drained from Wang Xifan’s face as he grabbed Wang Tengfei and retreated backward. He glanced back murderously at the large man from the Golden Frost Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Members of the Wang Clan, please conduct yourself with dignity,” said the large man coolly. The power of his Core Formation Cultivation base rolled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group of people Meng Hao was a part of descended to the ground. Meng Hao had a strange expression on his face, and he coughed lightly. He looked at Fatty hiding behind the large man. The things Fatty had been saying were somewhat embarrassing, and left Meng Hao feeling a little guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you see?” said Chen Fan quietly. “Li Fugui is no small figure in the Golden Frost Sect. Now that I think about it, Wang Tengfei’s current situation really is deserving of sympathy. Little Junior Brother, have you seen Chu Yuyan? Ai, I’m really curious which Sect that Cultivator is from who got entangled with Fellow Daoist Chu Yuyan….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh… yeah I saw her before….” said Meng Hao hesitantly, not sure of what else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Fan sighed. “I really hope I have a chance to meet that guy one day. He must be brilliant to be able to snatch Chu Yuyan away right out from under Wang Tengfei’s nose. Ah, such skill. He must truly be a man of character.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such skill, such skill….” Meng Hao felt even more guilty. Lowering his head, he slowly edged backward. At the same time, he looked over the crowd. He suddenly noticed Wang Youcai, and he stared in shock. Wang Youcai sat there taciturnly, avoiding Meng Hao’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wang Tengfei, do you really dare to attack me?” said Fatty, sticking his head out from behind the large man and pointing at Wang Tengfei. “Your granny!” he roared. “You truly dare to attack me? According to the rules of seniority of the five Sects and three Clans, I’m your Master Uncle. Do you actually dare to bully your seniors?!” Fatty slapped his bag of holding to produce a Spirit Stone, which he popped into his mouth. Crunching sounds echoed out as he crushed it into bits. It was quite a ferocious sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter crushing the Spirit Stone to pieces, Fatty extended his hand. With a wry smile, the big man produced a jade bottle which he handed over to Fatty. Fatty popped it into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Li Fugui, you are too excessive!” Wang Tengfei ground his teeth. Even as the words left his mouth, Fatty closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What exists between them is true love,” he said. “Do you understand what true love is? True love exists between your wife Chu Yuyan and another man. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. Why would you possibly interfere with that?!” People around started to laugh, causing Wang Tengfei’s face to grow even more enraged. “If only you understood. Ah, true love. It’s priceless! I truly admire that Fellow Daoist. He’s so skilled. He truly handled things masterfully….” As Fatty went on with his speech, Meng Hao continued to edge backward. However, he wasn’t fast enough. He suddenly noticed that Zhou Daya was staring directly at him, a look of disbelief and astonishment covering his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s heart began to thump. Although he had intentionally set this thing in motion, he had never imagined he would see a scene such as that playing out today. He wanted to hide, but suddenly, Zhou Daya’s raised his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s him!!” he shouted, pointing directly at Meng Hao, seemingly afraid people wouldn’t recognize him. “It’s him! That’s the Cultivator who I saw with Chu Yuyan!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Daya really did live up to his name, which means ‘big mouth.’ Not only did he like to gossip, he also had a very loud voice. His voice rang out clearly, causing everyone’s attention to instantly follow the line of his finger to fall onto Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face flickered. The surrounding Solitary Sword Sect disciples stared at him in shock and unconsciously edged away from him. Soon, he and Chen Fan stood there alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Fan was also gaping numbly at Meng Hao. He recovered his composure quickly, however, in the end, also quickly edged away. He didn’t want any misunderstandings to result from standing next to Meng Hao. If anyone tried to bully Meng Hao, he would leap to assist in an instant; but what was occurring right now was a romantic love scandal….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he edged backward, Chen Fan’s eyes began to glow brightly. A look of both disbelief and admiration filled them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zhou Daya pointed at Meng Hao, all of the Solitary Sword Sect disciples stared at him, as did the Cultivators from the Wang Clan, the Song Clan and the Blood Demon Sect. Everyone was looking at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Shiqi from the Blood Demon Sect had a strange expression on her face. She had noticed Meng Hao moments ago. At the moment, she snorted, turning her head to ignore him. Wang Youcai stared in shock at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Wang Tengfei, he stood there mutely, glaring at Meng Hao. Veins began to bulge out on his face, and veins of blood appeared in his eyes. He thought back to the Flying Rain-Dragon legacy, to the Reliance Inner Sect training. He thought back to his feelings in the Flying Rain Dragon’s cave. His humiliation and rage billowed up to the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was completely silent. All eyes were on Meng Hao. Of course, in the past days, the rumors about Chu Yuyan being seen with a strange man had been spreading throughout the five great Sects and three great Clans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had started in the Golden Frost Sect. Everything about the rumor made sense and was quite vivid. No one knew, and everyone wondered, who the strange man might be. Now here, in front of all these eyes, Meng Hao had been pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFatty stared in shock. He stood blankly for a moment, and then rubbed his eyes vigorously. Suddenly, he started to look very excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he was about to rush over, a dozen or so colorful beams of light approached from off in the distance. As they whistled down, it was clear that this was the Violet Fate Sect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChu Yuyan was not with them, however, there were two people who Meng Hao did recognize. They were none other than Qian Shuihen and Lu Song [1. Qian Shuihen and Lu Song were the guys who paid an exorbitant amount of Spirit Stones and treasures to get Meng Hao’s ordinary iron spear. It happened in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-1-chapter-55/\"\u003eChapter 55: Overbearing\u003c/a\u003e], who were now in the early Foundation Establishment stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey flew on either side of a young man with a cool expression. His body radiated the power of late Foundation Establishment, and seemed to occupy a position of great respect amongst the other Violet Fate Sect disciples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, ten more beams appeared. This was the Black Sieve Sect. The beautiful Han Bei [2. Han Bei’s last appearance was in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-2-chapter-164/\"\u003eChapter 164\u003c/a\u003e ] was among them. She was dressed in men’s clothing, but a single glance was enough to see that she was a woman. She was chatting and laughing with a Song Clan member as she flew down to the square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrival of the Violet Fate Sect and Black Sieve Sect would normally cause various members of other Sects to seek out friends and catch up. But a strange atmosphere now filled the air. Most people just glanced momentarily at the new arrivals from the other two Sects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Zhou Daya saw more people arriving, he once again cried out, his voice even louder, “It’s him! That’s the Cultivator I saw with Chu Yuyan. She was putting on his clothes….” In actuality, there is a vast difference between ‘wearing his clothes’ and ‘putting on his clothes.’ The Cultivators from the Violet Fate Sect all stopped in their tracks and stared at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs disciples of the Violet Fate Sect, how could they not be aware of the rumors swirling about regarding Chu Yuyan? As for Qian Shuihen and Lu Song, the instant they caught sight of Meng Hao, their eyes grew wide and they stared in shock. Then their eyes grew hateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been years since they had seen Meng Hao, but the blow they had received that year was enormous. Even down to this very day, people still talked about what had happened. The events had caused hatred to seep down into their bones. It was the greatest humiliation they had ever experienced in their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQian Shuihen stared at Meng Hao, and he started breathing heavily. Killing intent began to roil within Lu Song’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, it’s you!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, it’s you!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them roared, filling the spectators with even more shock. The details of the matter with Chu Yuyan were still not clear, but the intense rage of these two Violet Fate Sect disciples was clearly no joke. They obviously hated Meng Hao down to the marrow of their bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Joseph Apor, Lim Derek, Gary Cosby, Dewi Suryono and Vidya Pati\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-187\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-189\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-188","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM"}
