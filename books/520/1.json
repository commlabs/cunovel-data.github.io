{"id":44667,"no":1,"title":"Blue Wednesday","content":"The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day--a day\n\u003cbr\u003e to be awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste. \n\u003cbr\u003e Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed\n\u003cbr\u003e without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be\n\u003cbr\u003e scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams;\n\u003cbr\u003e and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say,\n\u003cbr\u003e `Yes, sir,\u0027 `No, sir,\u0027 whenever a Trustee spoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the\n\u003cbr\u003e oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular\n\u003cbr\u003e first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself\n\u003cbr\u003e to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been\n\u003cbr\u003e making sandwiches for the asylum\u0027s guests, and turned upstairs\n\u003cbr\u003e to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F,\n\u003cbr\u003e where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little\n\u003cbr\u003e cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their\n\u003cbr\u003e rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly\n\u003cbr\u003e and willing line towards the dining-room to engage themselves\n\u003cbr\u003e for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples\n\u003cbr\u003e against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning,\n\u003cbr\u003e doing everybody\u0027s bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm\n\u003cbr\u003e and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees\n\u003cbr\u003e and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of\n\u003cbr\u003e frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines\n\u003cbr\u003e of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates,\n\u003cbr\u003e to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. \n\u003cbr\u003e The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds,\n\u003cbr\u003e and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying\n\u003cbr\u003e home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome\n\u003cbr\u003e little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward\n\u003cbr\u003e watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream\n\u003cbr\u003e of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. \n\u003cbr\u003e In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another,\n\u003cbr\u003e to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself\n\u003cbr\u003e in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back\n\u003cbr\u003e in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring `Home\u0027 to the driver. \n\u003cbr\u003e But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her,\n\u003cbr\u003e that would get her into trouble if she didn\u0027t take care--but keen\n\u003cbr\u003e as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the\n\u003cbr\u003e houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha,\n\u003cbr\u003e in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house;\n\u003cbr\u003e she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings\n\u003cbr\u003e who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Je-ru-sha Ab-bott\n\u003cbr\u003e You are wan-ted\n\u003cbr\u003e In the of-fice,\n\u003cbr\u003e And I think you\u0027d\n\u003cbr\u003e Better hurry up!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs\n\u003cbr\u003e and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached\n\u003cbr\u003e room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced\n\u003cbr\u003e the troubles of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Who wants me?\u0027 she cut into Tommy\u0027s chant with a note of sharp anxiety.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett in the office,\n\u003cbr\u003e And I think she\u0027s mad.\n\u003cbr\u003e Ah-a-men!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. \n\u003cbr\u003e Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring\n\u003cbr\u003e sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron;\n\u003cbr\u003e and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm\n\u003cbr\u003e and nearly scrub his nose off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. \n\u003cbr\u003e What could have gone wrong, she wondered. Were the sandwiches\n\u003cbr\u003e not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady\n\u003cbr\u003e visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn\u0027s stocking? Had--O horrors!--\n\u003cbr\u003e one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F `sauced\u0027 a Trustee?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs,\n\u003cbr\u003e a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that\n\u003cbr\u003e led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression\n\u003cbr\u003e of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. \n\u003cbr\u003e He was waving his arm towards an automobile waiting in the curved drive. \n\u003cbr\u003e As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant,\n\u003cbr\u003e the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. \n\u003cbr\u003e The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran\n\u003cbr\u003e along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked,\n\u003cbr\u003e for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha\u0027s anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature\n\u003cbr\u003e a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. \n\u003cbr\u003e If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive\n\u003cbr\u003e fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. \n\u003cbr\u003e She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode,\n\u003cbr\u003e and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the\n\u003cbr\u003e matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable;\n\u003cbr\u003e she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned\n\u003cbr\u003e for visitors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.\u0027 Jerusha dropped\n\u003cbr\u003e into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. \n\u003cbr\u003e An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `I saw his back.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums\n\u003cbr\u003e of money towards the asylum\u0027s support. I am not at liberty to mention\n\u003cbr\u003e his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha\u0027s eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being\n\u003cbr\u003e summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees\n\u003cbr\u003e with the matron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. \n\u003cbr\u003e You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent\n\u003cbr\u003e through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with\n\u003cbr\u003e hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. \n\u003cbr\u003e Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his\n\u003cbr\u003e philanthropies have been directed solely towards the boys;\n\u003cbr\u003e I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree\n\u003cbr\u003e in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. \n\u003cbr\u003e He does not, I may tell you, care for girls.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `No, ma\u0027am,\u0027 Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected\n\u003cbr\u003e at this point.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was\n\u003cbr\u003e brought up.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall, then resumed\n\u003cbr\u003e in a slow, placid manner extremely trying to her hearer\u0027s suddenly\n\u003cbr\u003e tightened nerves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are sixteen,\n\u003cbr\u003e but an exception was made in your case. You had finished our school\n\u003cbr\u003e at fourteen, and having done so well in your studies--not always,\n\u003cbr\u003e I must say, in your conduct--it was determined to let you go on in\n\u003cbr\u003e the village high school. Now you are finishing that, and of course\n\u003cbr\u003e the asylum cannot be responsible any longer for your support. \n\u003cbr\u003e As it is, you have had two years more than most.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett overlooked the fact that Jerusha had worked hard\n\u003cbr\u003e for her board during those two years, that the convenience\n\u003cbr\u003e of the asylum had come first and her education second;\n\u003cbr\u003e that on days like the present she was kept at home to scrub.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your\n\u003cbr\u003e record was discussed--thoroughly discussed.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett brought accusing eyes to bear upon the prisoner in the dock,\n\u003cbr\u003e and the prisoner looked guilty because it seemed to be expected--\n\u003cbr\u003e not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in her record.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Of course the usual disposition of one in your place would be to\n\u003cbr\u003e put you in a position where you could begin to work, but you have\n\u003cbr\u003e done well in school in certain branches; it seems that your work\n\u003cbr\u003e in English has even been brilliant. Miss Pritchard, who is on our\n\u003cbr\u003e visiting committee, is also on the school board; she has been talking\n\u003cbr\u003e with your rhetoric teacher, and made a speech in your favour. \n\u003cbr\u003e She also read aloud an essay that you had written entitled,\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Blue Wednesday\".\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha\u0027s guilty expression this time was not assumed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `It seemed to me that you showed little gratitude in holding up\n\u003cbr\u003e to ridicule the institution that has done so much for you. Had you\n\u003cbr\u003e not managed to be funny I doubt if you would have been forgiven. \n\u003cbr\u003e But fortunately for you, Mr.--, that is, the gentleman who has\n\u003cbr\u003e just gone--appears to have an immoderate sense of humour. \n\u003cbr\u003e On the strength of that impertinent paper, he has offered to send\n\u003cbr\u003e you to college.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `To college?\u0027 Jerusha\u0027s eyes grew big. Mrs. Lippett nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `He waited to discuss the terms with me. They are unusual. \n\u003cbr\u003e The gentleman, I may say, is erratic. He believes that you\n\u003cbr\u003e have originality, and he is planning to educate you to become\n\u003cbr\u003e a writer.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `A writer?\u0027 Jerusha\u0027s mind was numbed. She could only repeat Mrs.\n\u003cbr\u003e Lippett\u0027s words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `That is his wish. Whether anything will come of it, the future\n\u003cbr\u003e will show. He is giving you a very liberal allowance, almost, for a girl\n\u003cbr\u003e who has never had any experience in taking care of money, too liberal. \n\u003cbr\u003e But he planned the matter in detail, and I did not feel free to\n\u003cbr\u003e make any suggestions. You are to remain here through the summer,\n\u003cbr\u003e and Miss Pritchard has kindly offered to superintend your outfit. \n\u003cbr\u003e Your board and tuition will be paid directly to the college,\n\u003cbr\u003e and you will receive in addition during the four years you are there,\n\u003cbr\u003e an allowance of thirty-five dollars a month. This will enable you\n\u003cbr\u003e to enter on the same standing as the other students. The money will\n\u003cbr\u003e be sent to you by the gentleman\u0027s private secretary once a month,\n\u003cbr\u003e and in return, you will write a letter of acknowledgment once a month. \n\u003cbr\u003e That is--you are not to thank him for the money; he doesn\u0027t care\n\u003cbr\u003e to have that mentioned, but you are to write a letter telling of\n\u003cbr\u003e the progress in your studies and the details of your daily life. \n\u003cbr\u003e Just such a letter as you would write to your parents if they\n\u003cbr\u003e were living.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent\n\u003cbr\u003e in care of the secretary. The gentleman\u0027s name is not John Smith,\n\u003cbr\u003e but he prefers to remain unknown. To you he will never be anything\n\u003cbr\u003e but John Smith. His reason in requiring the letters is that he\n\u003cbr\u003e thinks nothing so fosters facility in literary expression as\n\u003cbr\u003e letter-writing. Since you have no family with whom to correspond,\n\u003cbr\u003e he desires you to write in this way; also, he wishes to keep\n\u003cbr\u003e track of your progress. He will never answer your letters,\n\u003cbr\u003e nor in the slightest particular take any notice of them. \n\u003cbr\u003e He detests letter-writing and does not wish you to become a burden. \n\u003cbr\u003e If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem\n\u003cbr\u003e to be imperative--such as in the event of your being expelled,\n\u003cbr\u003e which I trust will not occur--you may correspond with Mr. Griggs,\n\u003cbr\u003e his secretary. These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory\n\u003cbr\u003e on your part; they are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires,\n\u003cbr\u003e so you must be as punctilious in sending them as though it\n\u003cbr\u003e were a bill that you were paying. I hope that they will always\n\u003cbr\u003e be respectful in tone and will reflect credit on your training. \n\u003cbr\u003e You must remember that you are writing to a Trustee of the John\n\u003cbr\u003e Grier Home.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha\u0027s eyes longingly sought the door. Her head was in a whirl\n\u003cbr\u003e of excitement, and she wished only to escape from Mrs. Lippett\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e platitudes and think. She rose and took a tentative step backwards. \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett detained her with a gesture; it was an oratorical\n\u003cbr\u003e opportunity not to be slighted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune\n\u003cbr\u003e that has befallen you? Not many girls in your position ever have\n\u003cbr\u003e such an opportunity to rise in the world. You must always remember--\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `I--yes, ma\u0027am, thank you. I think, if that\u0027s all, I must go\n\u003cbr\u003e and sew a patch on Freddie Perkins\u0027s trousers.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with dropped jaw,\n\u003cbr\u003e her peroration in mid-air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59723.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
