{"id":20442,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. IN CENTRAL PARK.","content":"This life is a Drama, its Plot strange and deep—\n\u003cbr\u003e We laugh at the Farce—at the Tragedy, weep:—\n\u003cbr\u003e The acts are surprises—no waits intervene\n\u003cbr\u003e And only the Author stands back of the scene.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For two months Sir Frederic Atherton had hardly eaten or slept, so great was his grief at Stella\u0027s disappearance. No stone had been left unturned by him in the search for Maurice Sinclair and his beautiful victim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No shadow of doubt as to Stella\u0027s unspotted purity, crossed his noble soul, and in despair he sat down to a hasty breakfast at the Club, while he ransacked his brain to find, if possible, some untried scheme for Maurice\u0027s capture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His eyes roved absently about the richly appointed place, and almost instantly, associated in his mind with these very surroundings, came the recollection of a former breakfast, at the same place some months previous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was breakfasting with a friend who had just returned from America, and in relating the news of their mutual acquaintances, mentioned the approaching reception of Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s adopted daughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Almost simultaneous with the mention of her name, a young man rose from another table and took a seat nearer the ones occupied by his friend and himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young man was slight, but athlete in build, and his face, although dark and sunburned, would have been extremely pleasing, but for a suspiciously unnatural moustache, that drooped heavily over his mouth, completely hiding that feature and thereby seriously injuring the amiability of his expression.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young man was evidently interested in their conversation, but Sir Frederic at the time gave it little thought, and the matter slipped from his mind a moment after. The occurrence returning to his memory so vividly at just this time, impressed him strangely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e Could this young man have been Maurice Sinclair, disguised and under an assumed name, masquerading about London, in search of information regarding his mother\u0027s household before returning thereto?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then another idea, relative to the flight of Maurice and Stella, occurred to him, and suddenly springing to his feet he exclaimed excitedly, \"I\u0027ll try it. It can do no harm.\" A week later he embarked incog. on a transatlantic steamer bound for New York.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Something seemed to tell him that Maurice Sinclair, hunted as he was by every police officer and detective in London, was sure, sooner or later, to fly to America for protection. Of course, the usual information had been cabled to American ports, but detection could be so easily avoided, that Sir Frederic felt that Maurice would take the risk as a choice between two evils. Then again he reasoned, that a man familiar, as Maurice was, with the ports of Hong Kong and Calcutta (and his blood ran cold at the very thought), would naturally return thereto if circumstances forced his departure from London. But obeying the whisper[Pg 96] that had so plainly suggested America to his mind, he found himself, after a rapid passage, safely landed in New York, and shortly after, comfortably situated in the Brunswick, one of its most spacious hotels.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To a man like Sir Frederic, the encumbrance of an assumed name was a never ceasing annoyance. His was a nature wholly antagonistic to deception of any sort, but he knew that in this manner only could he outwit so clever a rascal as the one he was pursuing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately, he found one true and tried friend before he had been in the city long, and together they worked and waited for clues that should lead to his loved one\u0027s speedy recovery. Weeks went by while he patiently searched, and four months after the disappearance of Stella, Sir Frederic, disgusted with his foolish chase across the water, was sadly preparing to return. On the last Sunday afternoon of his stay he went with his friend for a farewell drive through the magnificent boulevards of Central Park.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The day was perfect, and carriages of every description, from the private liveried turnout to[Pg 97] the hired cab and rustic country wagon, were ambling along, filled with men, women and children, all bent on securing as much pure air and sunshine as was obtainable during the short afternoon. Suddenly, at a sharp turn of the carriage-road, the vehicle containing the two men came side to side with a light phaeton, whose diminutive pony was ably guided by an extremely stylish young lady, and there, sitting by her side in evident favor, was the man for whom Sir Frederic was searching and for whose apprehension all London was desirous.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74773.html","bookId":1421,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM"}
