And seems they’re getting closer, as if clawing their way through. I’m expecting t’see an arm thrust out any time now.’ She hitched her thumbs in her weapon belt. ‘Thing is, sir, what happens then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into the Lightfall. Tried remembering memories that weren’t his own. The grinding of molars sounded like distant thunder in his head. ‘We fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And that’s why you’ve recruited everyone with arms and legs into this army of yours.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not everyone. The Letherii islanders—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can smell trouble better than anyone. Convicted criminals, almost the whole lot. It’s a case of the nerves all around, sir, and soon as they figure things out, they’ll start stepping up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eyed the woman. ‘What makes you so sure, Captain?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Soon as they figure things out, I said.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What things?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That there’s nowhere to run to, for one,’ she replied. ‘And that there won’t be any bystanders, no – what’s the word? Non-combatants. We got us a fight for our very lives ahead. Do you deny it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, studied the play of light on the blade again. ‘We will stand on the bones of our ancestors.’ He glanced at Pithy. ‘We have a queen to protect.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t you think your sister will be right here in the front line?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My sister? No, not her. The queen of Kharkanas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s her we’re gonna die protecting? I don’t get it, sir. Why her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced, lifted the sword and slowly sheathed it. ‘We are of the Shore. The bones at our feet are us . Our history. Our meaning. Here we will stand. It is our purpose.’ Memories not his own, yet still they stirred. ‘Our purpose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yours maybe. The rest of us just want to live another day. Get on with things. Making babies, tilling the ground, getting rich, whatever.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, eyes now on the wall. ‘Privileges, Captain, we cannot at the moment afford to entertain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I ain’t happy about the thought of dying for some Tiste Andii queen,’ Pithy said, ‘and I doubt I’m alone in that. So maybe I take back what I said earlier. There could be trouble ahead.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. There won’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Plan on cutting off a few heads?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If necessary.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe muttered a curse. ‘I hope not. Like I said before, so long as they all realize there’s nowhere to go. Should be enough, shouldn’t it?’ When no answer was forthcoming she cleared her throat and said, ‘Well, it comes down to saying the right things at the right time. Now, Watch Derryg, you might be an Errant-shitting warrior, and a decent soldier, too, but you’re lacking the subtleties of command—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are no subtleties in command, Captain. Neither my sister nor me is one for rousing speeches. We make our expectations plain and we expect them to be met. Without complaint. Without hesitation. It’s not enough to fight to stay alive. We must fight determined to win.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘People ain’t stupid – well, forget I said that. Plenty of ’em are. But something tells me there’s a difference between fighting to stay alive and fighting for a cause bigger than your own life, or even the lives of your loved ones, or your comrades. A difference, but for the life of me I couldn’t say what it is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were always a soldier, Captain?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePithy snorted. ‘Not me. I was a thief who thought she was smarter than she really was.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan considered that for a time. Before him, blurred faces pushed through the light, mouths opening, expressions twisting into masks of rage. Hands stretched to find his throat, clutched empty. He could reach out and touch the wall, if he so chose. Instead, he observed the enemy before him. ‘What cause, Captain, would you fight for? In the manner you describe – beyond one’s own life or those of loved ones?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now that’s the question, isn’t it? For us Letherii, this ain’t our home. Maybe we could come to want it to be, in time, a few generations soaking our blood into the land. But there won’t be any time. Not enough for that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If that is your answer—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No it ain’t. I’m working on it, sir. It’s called thinking things through . A cause, then. Can’t be some Tiste Andii queen or her damned throne, or even her damned city. Can’t be Yan Tovis, even though she brought ’em all through and so saved their lives. Memories die like beached fish and soon enough just the smell will do t’drive ’em away. Can’t be you neither.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-63.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
