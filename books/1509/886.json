That’s because this is a street for pedestrians, a lane for nobles, hidden away within this high technology world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh yet uniform stones covered this 2048 meter long lane. The buildings on each side of the lane were of completely different types, but every single building had its own unique aspects and history. There was ancient French gothic-style pointed buildings, the sprawling and majestic jade-carved buildings of ancient China, and were even Roman-style buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis street, which seemingly had no high technology present, was set within the most central, most developed area within Skyfire City. Supposedly, here, every single square meter of earth was worth as much as one of the newest, top-tier Michaely P12-class high atmosphere hovercar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree years had passed since the disaster. Things were back to normal and humanity had prospered, free from alien threat. The dark days were behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the battle was done Lan Qing – The East’s super soldier, the youngest admiral in history, backbone of the Eastern army, Peerless Light emperor of Middle Heaven and commander of An Lun – announced his retirement. However, he was sure to let everyone know that he would not be leaving the Eastern Alliance. If he was ever needed he would appear. He also mentioned he would be looking for a spouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t take long for the news to spread, and soon woman all throughout the human worlds – as young as eight and as old as eighty – were expressing their desire to be Mrs. Lan Qing. The lucky girl was never publicly revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ones known as the Middle Heaven Great Emperor of the North Pole Star of Purple Sublety, Guanyin the Queen of Mercy, and the Pharmacist later known as Queen Yama, vanished from the public eye. Legends claimed they still used their powers to protect humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs many anticipated, Skyfire Avenue became the strongest Adept organization in all the Alliances. The Wine Master continued to serve as chairman of the council, though it was only the others councilors who knew that he cursed the post every day. He was constantly heard to mutter his displeasure about how a certain someone was shirking their responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the North, master of the Hades bloodline Chu Chng took up the position vacated by the late Terminator as leader of the Great Conclave. The North remained as the largest Alliance, though two thirds of those planets that had once belonged to the West chose to join the Eastern Alliance. The ones that chose the North were those that were nearest to its borders. Angel and its sister planets, of course, decided to join with the East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the three years these seven planets had recovered well. Only one system of faith prevailed through the whole system, loyal to the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin. As far as they were concerned she was the only one responsible for pulling them back from the brink of extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe East’s total power and influence grew significantly after the conflict. Poseidon Group officially announced that they would be basing their operation out of the Eastern Alliance. Their family would continue operate out of their home planet. The East was more than happy to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoseidon Group retained its title as the richest organization in all of human space, although they kept a low profile after the human-alien war. More surprising, after the fighting was done the group agreed to hand over control of their sole bastion to the Eastern army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Eastern armed forces still controlled far fewer than the North, and likely would never be able to compete on that front. However, the two bastions universally accepted as the strongest in human space were under their command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe North had spent the last three years restoring order to the people. Because the East had enjoyed unity through the crisis it was able to prosper more quickly, ultimately catching up to the North.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now it was spring. Cool winds blew down the Avenue and rattled shuttered shop windows. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young girl, perhaps ten, wandered down the lane clad in a pretty white dress.

She was destined to be a beautiful woman when she grew up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t alone. Two young boys walked with her on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child on her left looked just barely old enough to walk on his own. The one on her right was a little older. They were perhaps three and four, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sister Jun’er, I’m hungry!” The boy on the right complained. He looked up at her and pouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know! We’re on our way to the Gourmet’s house to have a meal. Uncle said he was going to cook us something nice today.” Jun’er said, placating the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed a mouthful of saliva in anticipation. “Great!

When you’re with me you have to do what I say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young boy was strangely compliant. “Okay – I’ll listen to sister Jun’er. But see how good I am? You have to promise to marry me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely not,” Jun’er replied. “I already have a fiancé. I can’t agree to marry you. Any you’re only four years old. Do you even know what it means to get married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young boy refused to give in. “Of course I know, it means two people stay together for ever. Daddy told me once, he said if I like a girl I have to bravely go after her. He said going after what you want is half the battle. The girl \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e like the most is sister Jun’er, and I want to make you my wife. Say you’ll marry me, Jun’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snipped back at him. “No, of course not. We have the same daddy, how can we get married? That’s wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child petulantly pursed his lips. “An adopted daddy and a real daddy are different. What do think I’m still a baby? Your fiancé is daddy’s real son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the young boy spoke he flashed a jealous glance at the boy on her left, who was also carefully picking his way along the road by their side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other boy gave a fierce look back. He pressed himself against Jun’er and flung his arms around leg. “Sister, give me a hug!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as he asked and wrapped him in an embrace. “Don’t be scared, Lan Zhou. I’ll protect you. I won’t let anyone bully you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy on the right kicked up an even louder fuss. “That’s not fair, sister, you like him better!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJun’er stared at him with her dim eyes. “What’s unfair? He’s my fiancé, I’m going to marry him when we get older. Of course I’m going to treat my husband differently. Isn’t daddy nicer to you? Let me tell you, Hua Yun, if you keep teasing Lan Zhou I’m not going to play with you anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eMe!\u003c/em\u003e” He whined. “He’s so small, how can he be your fiancé? Even mommy and daddy say you’re too old for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJun’er paid him no mind. “Age isn’t a problem. You’re still a kid, you don’t understand. Anyway you should be glad, when I was your age I wasn’t even allowed to leave my house. I spent every day lonely by myself. You get to stay on Skyfire Avenue and everyone treats you so well. What do you have to complain about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flash recall behind her eyes when she said it. She remembered those days clearly, when she was lonely, all by herself.

Frankly speaking there was a lot in this novel I wanted to write for myself. My favorite part was the beginning, but many of my dear readers expressed a lack of understanding. Later I changed direction and focused more on conflict and combat. This book was an experiment, with the beginning following more of a novella-type arrangement. I truly enjoyed the world of Skyfire Avenue and the people in it. I’m curious who you liked best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaders who are familiar with me will know that my works are seamlessly connected.

All I can say is I’ll be returning to my roots as a more experienced and mature author. I promise to provide you all a feast for your imagination. I’m sure you all will enjoy \u0026lt;\u0026lt;Legend of the Dragon King\u0026gt;\u0026gt;!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranslator’s Note:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore RXW approached me with the offer to translate Skyfire Avenue, I had never even read a Chinese novel. My translation experience did not extend past paragraphs of medical texts. I’ve forgotten precisely when I began working on Skyfire Avenue, but it had been a project that has spanned years. Over that time there have been challenges and triumphs, and I have grown professionally during the course of this novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tang Jia San Shao expressed above, many of you shared similar concerns about the beginning of this story with readers throughout China. The author was bold in his decision to try something new, which ultimately didn’t have the effect he wanted. While there were ups and downs with the path he chose, I think we can agree that it created an engaging world, with multifaceted characters that were fascinating to follow. Tang Jia San Shao’s experimentation produced a unique work that I think stands alone in a difficult genre, completely unlike any other translated work. As a whole, while it may have felt tedious from time to time, I feel that the final product would not have been as satisfying if the setting had not been established as the author had chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere I was as a translator and reader changed throughout the course of the novel. In the beginning I was a novice, translating part-time between classes. I had passion for the prospects ahead and excitement in pursuing a new skill set. I think in some ways that might shine through in the product. Over time, when readers dwindled and I felt more like a burden to my employer, that passion waned. I always strove to make sure that my work was as engaging as I could make it, however, and I think that my ability to understand the intent and ‘voice’ of the author improved. Now as we close the proverbial book on Skyfire Avenue I hope that all of you enjoyed the journey. Though I did not create the world Lan Jue lived in I did have an opportunity to put my mark on it, and in so doing I’ve become invested in its reception. If it brought you any measure of joy, if it made a tough day better, if you laughed or scoffed or got teary-eyes than I’m proud I could help bring that to you. I’ll see you wherever the journey brings us next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Lai\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-896\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-901","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:08 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:08 AM"}
