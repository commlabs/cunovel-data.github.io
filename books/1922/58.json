I\u0027m going to work in my home office for a while. Come back to bed, and try to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were a few right answers to that question, Gideon. \u0027Let\u0027s talk about it tomorrow\u0027 would\u0027ve been one. \u0027Let\u0027s talk about it over the weekend\u0027 would\u0027ve been another. And even \u0027I\u0027m not ready to talk about it\u0027 would be okay. But you have some nerve acting like you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about while speaking to me like I\u0027m unreasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angel - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t.\" My arms wrapped around my waist. \"Do you think it was easy telling you about my past? Do you think it was painless cutting myself open and letting the ugliness spill out? It would\u0027ve been simpler to cut you off and date someone less prominent. I took the risk because I want to be with you. Maybe someday you\u0027ll feel the same way about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva! Eva, damn it, come back here. What\u0027s wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked faster. I knew how he felt: the sickness in the gut that spread like cancer, the helpless anger, and the need to curl up in private and find the strength to shove the memories back into the deep dark hole they still lived in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t an excuse for lying or deflecting the blame onto me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatched my purse off the chair where I\u0027d dropped it on the way in from dinner and I rushed out the front door into the foyer to the elevator. The car doors were closing with me inside when I saw him step into the living room through the open front door. His nakedness ensured he couldn\u0027t come after me, while the look in his eyes ensured I wouldn\u0027t stay. He\u0027d donned his mask again, that striking implacable face that kept the world a safe distance away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking, I leaned heavily against the brass handrail for support. I was torn between my concern for him, which urged me to stay, and my hard-won knowledge, which assured me that his coping strategy wasn\u0027t one I could live with. The road to recovery for me was paved with hard truths, not denials and lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwiping at my wet cheeks when I passed the third floor, I took deep breaths and collected myself before the doors opened on the lobby level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorman whistled down a passing cab for me and was such a consummate professional that he acted like I was dressed for work rather than sporting bare feet and a black dressing gown. I thanked him sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was so grateful to the cabbie for getting me home quickly that I tipped him well and didn\u0027t care about the furtive looks I got from my own doorman and the front desk staffer. I didn\u0027t even care about the look I got from the stunning, statuesque blonde who stepped out of the elevator I was waiting for, until I smelled Cary\u0027s cologne on her and realized the T-shirt she was wearing was one of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took in my half-dressed state with an amused glance. \"Nice robe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blonde took off with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached my floor, I found Cary lounging in the open doorway in a robe of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened and opened his arms to me. \"Come here, baby girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked straight into him and hugged him tight, smelling a woman\u0027s perfume and hard sex all over him. \"Who\u0027s the chick that just left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another model. Don\u0027t worry about her.\" He drew me into the apartment, and shut and locked the door. \"Cross called. He said you were heading back and he has your keys. He wanted to be sure I was here and awake to let you in. For what it\u0027s worth, he sounded torn up and anxious. You wanna talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting my purse down on the breakfast bar, I went into the kitchen. \"He had another nightmare. A really bad one. When I asked him about it he denied, he lied, then he acted like I was nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, the classics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone started ringing. I flicked the switch on the base that turned the ringer off and Cary did the same to the handset he\u0027d left on the counter. Then I pulled out my smartphone, closed the alert that said I\u0027d missed numerous calls from Gideon, and sent him a text message; Home safe. Hope you sleep well the rest of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI powered the phone off and tossed it back in my purse; then I grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge. \"The kicker is that I told him all my junk earlier tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary\u0027s brows shot up. \"So you did it. How\u0027d he take it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than I had any right to expect. Nathan ought to hope they never run into each other.\" I finished the bottle. \"And Gideon agreed to the couples counseling you suggested. I thought we\u0027d turned a corner. Maybe we did, but we hit a brick wall anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem okay, though.\" He leaned into the breakfast bar. \"No tears. Really calm. Should I be worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my belly to ease the fear that had rooted there. \"No, I\u0027ll be all right. I just...I want it to work out between us. I want to be with him, but lying about serious issues is a deal breaker for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod. I couldn\u0027t let myself even consider that we might not get past this. I was already feeling antsy. The need to be with Gideon was a frantic beat in my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a tough cookie, baby girl. I\u0027m proud of you.\" He came to me, linked our arms, and turned off the kitchen lights. \"Let\u0027s crash and start a new day when we wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought things were going well with you and Trey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin was glorious. \"Honey, I think I\u0027m in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With who?\" I leaned my cheek against his shoulder. \"Trey or the blonde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trey, silly. The blonde just provided a workout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a lot to say about that, but it wasn\u0027t the time to get into Cary\u0027s history of sabotaging his own happiness. And maybe focusing on how good things were with Trey was the best way to handle this instance of it. \"So you\u0027ve finally fallen for a good guy. We should celebrate.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-58.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
