Beyond what I just experienced, I already have an intimate knowledge of Loric psychology, the relationship between the Garde and their Cêpan. I have the entirety of One’s history burned into my brain. I’ve had that ever since the first transfer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe levels me with his stare. He’s evidently flustered, his hair damp with sweat, but that doesn’t make him any less scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it’s in there,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a chill at his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may not remember it consciously, but I know it’s in there, in your brain. And I know that I could get it,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he speaks, it’s like he’s talking to himself. “Our understanding of Mogadorian physiology is well beyond what we understand about Loric or mortals. With my neurological mapping techniques, I could do what Anu couldn’t. Run those currents three times as hard, and rip that intel straight from your brain and onto my hard drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me. I feel weirdly exposed, objectified, like a slab of meat at a butcher shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But for that,” he says, chuckling bitterly, “I’d need your father’s permission to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m dismissed to finish out my day at the surveillance facility. I have no fight left in me, and my rankings take a nosedive. Sixteen, eighteen, eighteen, twenty. Last place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know Dr. Zakos immediately reported the experiment’s failure to my father, but I doubt he took the risk of pitching his idea of mentally vivisecting me to the General. I have two more days left in the lab before my father decides if my results qualify me for survival. Either he will have me executed, or he will deem me an asset to the cause and allow me to continue working as a surveyor. Oh joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the lab it’s another miserable dinner. The General is busy down in his briefing room, so it’s just my mother and Kelly. Kelly refuses to even look at me. When my mother goes to the kitchen, I turn to her, try to start a conversation. We haven’t been close since before the mind transfer, almost five years ago. I wonder if she can even remember back then, when she hated Ivan for teasing her and roughhousing with her, and seemed to adore me, her gentle older brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t seen you in the tunnels,” I say. “How are things going in the Nursery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is silent, slowly chewing her food and staring straight ahead. It’s hard to believe a fourteen-year-old girl could be so full of such a steely hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelly, I’m sorry if it’s embarrassing that I survived, that you have to explain that your loser brother has come back—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ivanick told me,” she says, hissing at me suddenly. “He told me the truth about you. I know what Mom doesn’t. You’re a traitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach does a somersault. I feel like I could throw up my entire dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you can pretty much stop trying to make up with me. It’s not going to happen.” She gets up from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you were dead,” she says, before running up the stairs to her room and slamming the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night to you too,” I say, laughing miserably to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner I go up to my room. One isn’t there. I haven’t seen her since last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, this doesn’t surprise me. The mind transfer was so fast, and so quickly aborted that I doubt it did much to reestablish her foothold in my consciousness. Perhaps that’s the thing I felt like I was on the verge of understanding—how to keep her alive inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s funny to think Zakos thought he was covering his ass with the General by protecting my life. If Zakos had killed me, my father probably would’ve given him a medal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have nothing to stay up for. I go to bed early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleepless in bed, I consider the pitiful irony of my current situation. I came back here to rescue my one and only friend in the world, yet I fail to save her, just as I failed to save Hannu. If she isn’t gone for good, she will be soon enough. And now I’m stuck here, trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA desultory day at work. I’m pulling in rankings in the thirten-to-fifteen range. Pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve scaled back on my “Discard” trick. Why bother trying to impress anyone with my rankings, anyway? So I actually investigate each link that’s fed to my monitor, even though it damages my productivity. At least it’s more interesting than mindlessly shuttling the leads into one folder or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI click on a link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one leads to a forum dedicated to readers of some publication called “They Walk Among Us.” The Mogadorian mainframe has isolated a thread titled “NEXT ISSUE?” posted by a user TWAUFAN182. A threaded dialogue unfolds when I click on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease I’ve read TWAU no. 3 so many times. Please tell me when next ish will come out? Thanks! ☺—TWAUFAN182\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry TWAUFAN. No plans for issue #4 yet, but be assured we have plenty material for one. Thanks for reading.—admin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? What material? U can’t leave us hanging like that! Spill it!—TWAUFAN182\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on man, give us a hint!!!—TWAUFAN182\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been weeks with no updates. This forum is dead, RIP. LOL.—TWAUFAN182\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat exchange was dated a year ago. Then, this morning …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry. Been busy. We’ve made contact, definitely extraterrestrial. True MOG in captivity.—admin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost gasp. There are humans out there who have captured a Mogadorian? Or who at least think they’ve captured a Mogadorian?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know at once that this is the first link that’s passed through my monitor that’s truly worthy of an “EHP” ranking. I click on the hyperlink and drag it over to the “Investigate” directory … but then I stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would I alert the Mogadorians to the location of these humans? Humans the Mogs will undoubtedly capture and kill? I might get in trouble if I discard the link—surely there are failsafes built into the system for erroneous Discards—but why should I make it easier for these Mogadorian bastards? By discarding this link, I will save a human life … or at least slow down the Mogadorian hunting machine for a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t care if I live or die. If One is gone and I’m stuck in this vile society, why should I fight to live? The pleasure of outperforming Serkova has faded; besides, with rankings like my current ones, that ship has sailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI click Discard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’ll come for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my bones, I know I’m going to reap hell for what I’ve done. And I don’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck the Mogadorians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start dumping every link on my monitor into the Discard directory, as fast as I can. There’s no upper limit on the number of links that can get routed to a single monitor—the more links you process, the more get routed your way—so before I know it I’ve chucked upwards of three hundred links into the Discard directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m making a spectacular mess of their system. The clock counts down to the end of the hour. How many unevaluated Discards can I cram into the directory before my fellow surveyors catch on? For that matter, how long until my treasonous evidence-burying gets discovered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m exhilarated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hourly rankings come in. I’ve discarded 611 links. Investigated 0. My provisional accuracy ranking is a hilarious 11 percent. Better yet, as if to make a mockery of their entire ranking algorithm, I come in first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell, Adamus!” Serkova snarls at me. The others turn around to face me, all the work in the surveyor facility grinding to a halt. No one knows how to react to my total breakdown. “Are you fricking nuts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at Serkova, dizzy from my own outlandish behavior. “Yeah, I think I might be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen an alarm goes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the heavy march of footsteps coming down the hall: soldiers dispatched from HQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You deserve whatever you get,” says Serkova, spitting at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dodge out into the Northwest tunnel to see the soldiers coming, fronted by the General. They look pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I’m going out, I’m going out with a bang. I run towards the marching guards … then pull to a stop in front of Zakos’s lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey Pops,” I say, taunting the General. “Did I do something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what you’ve done,” he sneers at me. He gestures to the guards to seize me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resist, swinging my arms wildly, shouting as loud as I can. The Mogadorians hardly know how to react to such an undignified resistance. I can feel my father cringing in embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards manage to subdue me, but the ruckus has attracted Dr. Zakos’s attention. He steps out into the hall, as the guards begin dragging me away, probably to feed me to some hungry piken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I worry my plan has failed, but then I hear Zakos’s voice, calling from down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“General! Wait!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father halts our progress to listen to what Zakos has to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I may be so bold … I may be able to put your son’s life to some use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m back in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZakos has convinced my father to allow him to perform an accelerated mind transfer between me and One. The process will be so intense it will kill me, literally frying my brain. But Zakos has guaranteed the General that he will be able to download the contents of One’s transferred memories from my brain after my death. “If your son has been such a disappointment in life, at least allow him to be of service in death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZakos assured the General that even if the intelligence he extracts from my brain is of little consequence, the results of the experiment will represent a tremendous leap forward for Mogadorian technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need to make a hard sell, Zakos,” I said, still trapped in the guards’ grip. I turned to my father, an impudent smile on my lips. “Isn’t that right, Pops? He had you on board at ‘Kill Adamus,’ didn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe General didn’t even look at me. He nodded at his guards, who released me, then turned to the doctor. “Have the results on my desk by tomorrow morning,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been in the lab since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuards monitor the door, but I’m not bound or watched by anyone but Zakos. Where am I going to go? How can I possibly escape? As my little demonstration in the hallway proved, I’m no match against Mogadorian soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither my father nor my sister has seen fit to visit me in my final hours. But my mother ventured down to deliver me a last meal. She entered the lab a few hours ago, carrying a couple slices of fresh-baked bread wrapped in a napkin and a plastic container filled with soup. She hesitated for a moment, looking for a suitable place to lay the meal. Then, realizing there was no good place for it, she wordlessly put the bread and soup on a laboratory counter. Then she turned her back to me, her hand on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it true?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is what true?” I asked, a bit spitefully. I wanted to make her spell it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you’ve betrayed the Mogadorian cause.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess my father figured we were past sugarcoating things and had told her everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, she left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-search-for-sam-lorien-legacies-the-lost-files-4/page-8.html","bookId":1682,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
