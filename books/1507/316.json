My father gave me a call to tell me that my grandmother was hospitalized. She’s 80 years old, and had a minor stroke. When I was young, my grandmother took care of me, in fact, I even lived with her all the way through high school (I’m actually the only boy in the entire family, all my other cousins are girls, which of course caused all my aunts and uncles to be a bit jealous).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, when my father called, I got quite upset, and immediately went to see my grandmother. I didn’t get back until late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was looking at the comments section and saw that everyone wants to see a third chapter today. I’m really tired, and my heart is in a bit of chaos, but I went ahead according to plan and published this third update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the final chapter of book 3!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow we begin book four, Five Colored Paragon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first book of ISSTH was the story of the State of Zhao. The second book was about the initial dealings with the Southern Domain. The third book was regarding the path of the Dao of alchemy. As for the fourth book….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me, Meng Hao will rise to prominence in this fourth book!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive Colored Paragon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom Deathblade:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s hard to believe we\u0027ve already reached the end of book 3. I\u0027m very excited to get into the content of book 4. However, before I do so, I would like to take a short break of... one day. That\u0027s right, from the beginning until now, I haven\u0027t taken a single day off from posting chapters, not even when I went on vacation, or when Madam Deathblade went into labor and Baby Deathblade was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think this is a good place to do so. I will take tomorrow off, and then resume posting chapters the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past month since Baby Deathblade was born have been tiring, but not \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e exhausting. However, I\u0027ve now resumed my normal full-time job, and I\u0027m quite certain that the translation will be affected. For the next two months, I can\u0027t guarantee that I will be able to post 14 chapters per week. I will definitely continue with the 7 guaranteed chapters, and anticipate being able to add 3-5 sponsored chapters in as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs many of you know, my full time work prevents me from translating on weekends, which means I have to translate double chapters on Mondays and Wednesdays. Before, that was doable, but now that Baby Deathblade is here, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll be able to keep up that pace. The good news is that I\u0027ve already negotiated with my company to adjust my works schedule in a way that will ensure I can post 14 chapters per week. That change will occur early next year. Until then, I will do my best to translate as many as possible per week, and hope that you will all be able to bear with a slightly slower release rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-3-chapter-313\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-314\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-3-chapter-4","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM"}
