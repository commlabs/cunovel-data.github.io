One look at her and anyone can see she\u0027s a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Raen, don\u0027t criticize me,\" Euphemia pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe son ignored his mother and leaned down close to Brenna\u0027s ear. \"Sit by me at the table and tell me all about your wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she turned around to answer him, she knew she wouldn\u0027t be able to hide her repulsion, and so she directed her remarks to his mother instead. \"I mustn\u0027t intrude upon your joyful reunion with your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense, I only left her side a week ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I assumed it had been a much longer separation,\" she lied, for she remembered quite well that Euphemia had insisted she hadn\u0027t seen her son in a long, long while. \"But a week is still a long time to a mother, isn\u0027t that so, Lady MacAlister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" Euphemia answered. \"Raen, you\u0027re standing entirely too close to Brenna. I\u0027m not about to be ignored any longer. Come over here and sit with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hadn\u0027t realized I was standing close,\" he said with such a tone of surprise that his mother obviously thought he was sincere. Brenna wasn\u0027t so easily fooled, however. She resisted an urge to sigh with relief as soon as he let go of her and strolled over to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, you have my permission to go about your duties. Raen, I have some interesting news to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna hurried toward the entrance before Euphemia could change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaen stopped her. \"We heard thunder. Wasn\u0027t it raining when you came inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why aren\u0027t your clothes wet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t about to admit the truth, that she had been inside several minutes before the downpour started, for then she would have to explain what she\u0027d been doing, and they\u0027d know she had deliberately listened to their private conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two very thoughtful servants held cloaks over my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nod indicated he accepted her lie. \"I hope to God the rain lets up soon. I hate being cooped up inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that it was rather peculiar that the rain would keep him in. Connor\u0027s soldiers went about their duties regardless of the weather. Raen wasn\u0027t at all like the other men, however. He had been overindulged and pampered by his mother and probably didn\u0027t realize what a weakling he appeared to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow in heaven\u0027s name was she ever going to get through supper tonight? She hoped to God she didn\u0027t have to sit next to Connor\u0027s stepbrother. The mere possibility made her lose her appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe avoided the hall for the rest of the day until it was time to join her relatives for the evening meal. To her surprise, the evening turned out to be quite pleasant. Not only was Euphemia less abrasive, Raen was also somewhat charming. He sat across from her at the table, entertaining both his mother and her with amusing stories from his past. By the time she went upstairs, she was actually looking forward to sharing her next meal with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending another lovely evening with him the following night, she began to feel guilty for initially judging him so harshly. She had thought the worst of him and now realized how wrong she\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, Raen had been overly enthusiastic at their first encounter, but not because he had lecherous intentions she decided. Perhaps he just didn\u0027t know any better. And maybe he was trying to counter his mother\u0027s uncertain attitude toward her son\u0027s wife by showing Brenna she had his complete approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to bed that night feeling she had simply overreacted and vowed to never let that happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone deserved a second chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third morning of Connor\u0027s absence, Brenna awakened to sunshine and laughter. She threw off her covers and went to the window to look out at the glorious day. Servants were hurrying about below, and from the joy in their faces she knew they loved being outside as much as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were at least a hundred things she wanted to accomplish today, and while she knew she shouldn\u0027t put her duties aside, she meant to do just that in favor of exploring the hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling in anticipation, she hurried to get dressed and go downstairs. The hall was deserted, and though she tried, she couldn\u0027t get the heavy door open so she could go down to the courtyard. She wasn\u0027t defeated, however, and turned to go out the back door instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, mi\u0027lady. Did you sleep well?\" Netta called out from the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you,\" she answered. \"Has Lady MacAlister come down yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, mi\u0027lady, she hasn\u0027t. Raen has already left the holding to go riding for the day. He told me he wouldn\u0027t be back until supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went outside the walls with some of Connor\u0027s soldiers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he rode alone. He\u0027s taking a risk, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must not think so,\" Brenna replied with a shrug. \"I wonder where he plans to go,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t have been proper for me to ask,\" Netta said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna wasn\u0027t paying attention to the servant now, for she\u0027d only just noticed the pile of items stacked on the top of the low chest in the entrance. As soon as Netta convinced her they looked familiar to her because they belonged to her, Netta helped carry everything back up to Brenna\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening, Raen returned to the holding just in time to share his evening meal with his mother and Brenna. He looked tired from his ride, but was still quite pleasant, and once again, he did nothing that was in the least inappropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ready to go upstairs at the very same time she was. He clasped hold of her elbow and walked by her side, which was really quite gallant, and told her a humorous story that made both of them laugh. His hand brushed across her br**sts as he reached for the door latch, but it was apparent from the innocent look on his face that he hadn\u0027t even realized what he had done, leaving her to wonder why she was so quick to become suspicious again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was wrong with her, she wondered while she prepared for bed, and finally concluded that the strain of trying to win Euphemia\u0027s approval was making her a nervous twit. \u0027Twas the truth, the woman could make a saint lose her temper. No wonder Brenna had her guard up all the time. Connor\u0027s stepmother was an extremely difficult woman to please, and winning her over was proving to be far more difficult than Brenna had anticipated. While Euphemia never openly criticized her, she still managed to find fault with everything she did, and in a backhanded, condescending way that made Brenna want to clench her teeth together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t about to give up, of course, and decided she would simply double her efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Raen had once again left the holding to go riding alone before Brenna had come downstairs. She spent a trying day seeing to Euphemia\u0027s every comfort and was worn out by supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst was yet to come, however. Brenna\u0027s evening wasn\u0027t at all delightful; it was god-awful. She tried to engage Raen in conversation, but he was in a sullen, defiant mood. Being charming must have been a strain on him, because he discarded all attempts at being the least bit polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe acted like a lecher again. He never took his gaze off her—or rather, her mouth—throughout the endless meal, and from the smirk on his face and the look in his eyes, she knew he was fully aware of how uncomfortable he was making her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEuphemia chose to be oblivious to what was going on. Brenna doubted she would have done anything about it even if asked to. Her devotion to her son blinded her to his faults. She considered Raen to be perfect, which was more than evident from the way she constantly bowed to his wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until that night, Euphemia found fault with just about everyone and everything else, though, except the meals. Brenna thought her mother-in-law was enjoying her food; she ate everything on her trencher just as she had at her previous meals, but after the table was cleared and the servants left the hall, Euphemia announced her dissatisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, I realize you\u0027ve been unprepared for company for the last several days and have obviously been in too much of a rush to go over supper arrangements thoroughly with your cook, and for that reason I have held my tongue. I cannot keep silent any longer, however, and must insist you replace the incompetent woman in your kitchen with someone more skilled. Tonight was the worst disaster yet. I swear I ate more fat than fowl, and the tarts were so bitter and stringy I could barely get them down. Has Connor had to put up with this poor excuse for food long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, Brenna hasn\u0027t lived here long enough to know if he has or not,\" Raen snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEuphemia continued to frown at Brenna. \"You look flushed, dear. Have you put in a long day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go upstairs to bed? Raen will be happy to keep me company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t excuse herself fast enough. Unfortunately, Raen followed her to the entrance steps. He grabbed hold of her arm, told her he was escorting her, and pressed against her side. She was all but hanging over the railing in her attempt to put some distance between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t any need to go upstairs with me, Raen. I\u0027m sure you have more important things to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve already taken one serious fall, and these steps are dangerously steep,\" he argued as he pulled her along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you hear about my fall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked one of the servants how you injured your forehead, and she told me you fell down the stairs. I would be remiss in my duty to my brother if I didn\u0027t make certain you were kept safe while he was away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fell down because I wasn\u0027t paying attention to where I was going. I am paying attention now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of her arm, giving her only a few seconds to feel relieved before he slipped his arm around her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please let go of me,\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her. \"Are you eager to see Connor again? I know you must miss him, especially at night when you\u0027re in bed and you\u0027re wanting to feel him between your thighs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not dare talk to me in such a way,\" she ordered. She was so furious, she could barely control herself and increased her struggles to get away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted his grip, moving upward until his fisted hand rested just below her right breast, making it impossible for her to struggle now because, every time she moved, his knuckles rubbed against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never once looked down at her or showed any reaction at all to the pain she knew she was inflicting in his arm with her nails digging into his flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could take care of you while he\u0027s away,\" he whispered. \"I know how to make the ache go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave your door unlatched tonight, Brenna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned by the filth he spewed, she could barely keep her wits about her. \"If you don\u0027t let go of me, I swear I\u0027ll scream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why in heaven\u0027s name would you want to scream?\" he asked in mock astonishment, while his fingers slowly uncoiled and spread upward to squeeze her breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger gave her the strength of five men. She drove her elbow into his side and blessedly got just the reaction she wanted. He grunted in obvious pain and let go of her. She moved back against the door of her bedroom and reached for her dagger. She felt a second\u0027s panic when she touched her side and realized the knife wasn\u0027t in the pouch looped to her belt, but Raen wasn\u0027t looking at her now or trying to grab her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door for her, bid her good night, and strolled away. He was whistling as he went down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking with rage and terror, she ran inside, bolted the door closed behind her, and broke into sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in God\u0027s name was she going to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility that he might try to touch her again terrified her. She slept on Connor\u0027s side of the bed that night and didn\u0027t go downstairs until later than customary the following morning. She was, however, much calmer, because she realized that Raen wouldn\u0027t dare do anything inappropriate in front of witnesses and as long as she was never alone with him, she would be safe until Connor came home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute she saw her husband, she was going to tell him exactly what had happened, but until he returned and sent Raen away, it was her duty to look out for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor should be the first to know. Raen was his stepbrother, and it wouldn\u0027t be right to tell anyone else, unless it became absolutely necessary. She wasn\u0027t about to suffer so much as an obscene look from the vile man however. If he came near her, she would banish him from the keep immediately, providing she had the power to do so, and if Quinlan told her she didn\u0027t have the authority, she would either tell him what had happened or pack her satchel and move in with the Kincaids. Alec had told her he would never deny her anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked around in a rage most of the afternoon, and at supper that evening, she ignored Raen and urged Euphemia to tell her all about herself. Connor\u0027s stepmother seemed to enjoy being the center of attention and spent over an hour complimenting herself. Brenna pretended to hang on every word. She wasn\u0027t about to leave the hall unless her stepmother was with her, which soon became apparent to Raen, because he finally went outside to stretch his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dared to ask Brenna if she would like to accompany him, in a mocking tone and with a sneer that told her he knew what her game was and found it amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" she answered without bothering to look at him. \"I would rather listen to your mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Euphemia, you\u0027ve had such an interesting life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a tragic life,\" Euphemia corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Brenna\u0027s encouragement, she then proceeded to tell her all about the pain she had endured over the loss of her dear parents. No one had ever suffered the way Euphemia had, and no one had ever had so many crushing disappointments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEuphemia didn\u0027t stop talking about herself for another hour or so. Brenna stayed by her side, pretending to be fascinated, and when, at last, she announced she was going up to bed, Brenna took hold of her arm and walked by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant to talk to you about the evening meals, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant to have a word with you too. Once again, I was disappointed, Brenna. Didn\u0027t you follow my instructions and get rid of the cook?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course I did,\" Brenna lied. \"I\u0027ve come up with a plan I hope you\u0027ll approve. You are far more knowledgeable than I, and I could use your counsel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t berate yourself. You don\u0027t know any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna didn\u0027t argue, but she didn\u0027t agree either. \"I have asked five women to take turns preparing your evening meals, and I will let you decide at the end of the week who is the best skilled to suit your needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEuphemia shrugged with indifference. \"Leave it to me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-34.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM"}
