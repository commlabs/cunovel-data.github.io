She looked at the rest of the group. \"Get out of here, all of you! I don\u0027t like that kind of joke, especially now. Haven\u0027t you made enough trouble with your meddling? Poor Alexandra in the guest room, and Maeve scarcely in the ground . . . Melanie, I want them out of the house!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel and Granny Quincey were both fluttering. \"Oh dear, oh dear,\" Granny Quincey was saying, raising hands that looked like little bird claws, and \"Oh, please, Miss Burke,\" Laurel was beseeching, almost in tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no respect at all,\" Aunt Constance said, breathing hard. Her eyes were as bright as if she had a fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young people never do, Constance,\" Adam\u0027s grandmother said, chuckling. \"Why, I remember when we were their age, the mischief we used to get up to ... oh, me.\" Still laughing and shaking her head, Adam\u0027s grandmother popped another cookie in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandma, please listen. It\u0027s not a joke,\" Adam began helplessly, but it was no use. There was too much noise; everyone was talking at once. Over it all Great-aunt Constance continued to order them out, telling Melanie to forget about the mess on the floor and just go. Granny Quincey was twittering and making calming gestures, which everybody ignored. Old Mrs. Franklin was smiling at them all benevolently. Diana was pleading with Melanie\u0027s aunt to listen, but to no avail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the last time!\" Aunt Constance cried, flapping a hand as if to shoo Diana and the Club out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Burke!\" Cassie yelled. She felt close to tears herself, although Nick had been quietly trying to escort her out since the shouting had started. Cassie didn\u0027t want to go; she thought she understood what Great-aunt Constance was talking about when she mentioned the kids\u0027 meddling. \"Miss Burke,\" she repeated, forcing her way forward again. She found herself directly in front of Great-aunt Constance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Cassie said, and it was suddenly quiet enough that she could hear the unsteadiness in her own voice. \"It\u0027s my mom that\u0027s in your guest room, and you know how grateful I am that you\u0027re taking care of her. And it\u0027s my grandmother that\u0027s in the ground. But who do you think did that to them? It wasn\u0027t the Club. My grandmother told me before she died that he had planned all along to come back, and that she always knew he would manage to do it. It\u0027s true that it\u0027s partly the Circle\u0027s fault he\u0027s back -\u0026nbsp; it\u0027s partly my fault. And we\u0027re sorry, more sorry than you can know. But he really is here.\" She paused a moment, then added in almost a whisper, \"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance was breathing very quickly through her nose. She drew herself up more regally than ever, her lips a thin red slash across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t believe any of what you\u0027re saying. It is simply im-impossible - \" The woman\u0027s expression changed, twisting in pain. She gave a gasp and clutched at her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aunt Constance,\" Melanie cried, rushing to her. It took both her and Adam to help the rigid woman to a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I call a doctor?\" Diana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Aunt Constance said, lifting her head. \"It\u0027s nothing. I\u0027m all right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not nothing, Constance,\" a quavery voice said, and Cassie saw Granny Quincey getting off the sofa to come stand beside the chair. \"It\u0027s your heart telling you the truth. I think we\u0027d better listen to these children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence while Melanie\u0027s aunt looked at Melanie, then at Adam, then at Cassie. Cassie forced herself to return the piercing gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance\u0027s eyes shut and she slowly leaned back in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" she said, without looking at anyone. \"Come in, all of you, and find somewhere to sit down. Then you can tell your story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So finally we decided we\u0027d better talk to you three, since you were the ones who might remember him from the last time,\" Diana said. \"We thought of asking our parents, too - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go to your parents,\" Aunt Constance said flatly. She had sat and listened to the whole tale, her expression getting grimmer and grimmer. An aura of bleak horror hung in the room. \"They wouldn\u0027t understand,\" she said, and her gaze settled on Cassie emptily, making Cassie think of her mother\u0027s blank eyes. \"They won\u0027t remember. Dear God, how I\u0027ve wished that I could forget too ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s past is past,\" Granny Quincey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Great-aunt Constance. She straightened. \"But I don\u0027t know how you think three old women are going to help you - against him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought that you might remember something about him, some weakness; something we can use to fight him,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance slowly shook her head. Granny Quincey was frowning, her face pursed into hundreds of wrinkles. Old Mrs. Franklin wore a very pleasant expression; Cassie couldn\u0027t tell if she\u0027d been following the story or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he can come back from the dead, he can\u0027t have many weaknesses,\" Aunt Constance whispered harshly. \"And he was always clever at manipulating. You say that Faye Chamberlain is on his side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re afraid so,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bad. He\u0027ll use her to get at you, at your weaknesses. Lure her away from him if you can. But how?\" Aunt Constance\u0027s brow lined in concentration. \"The hematite - take that from her. It\u0027s very dangerous; he can use it to influence her mind.\" Diana glanced at Cassie, as if to say, I told you. Aunt Constance was going on. \"And you say the skull is gone now? Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked like it exploded when Faye was holding it, just before we were all knocked out,\" Cassie said. \"Something exploded out of it, anyway. And we couldn\u0027t find a trace of it afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . there\u0027s no way to use that against him, then. And you, Cassie, you haven\u0027t found anything in your grandmother\u0027s Book to help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. I haven\u0027t gotten all the way through it, though,\" Cassie admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance was shaking her head. \"Power, you need power to use against him. You\u0027re all too young to fight him - and we\u0027re too old. And in between our ages are nothing but fools. There\u0027s no power strong enough around here.. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was once,\" Granny Quincey said in her reedy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance looked at her, and her expression changed. \"Once . . . yes, of course.\" She turned to the Circle. \"If the old stories are true, there once was a power strong enough to destroy Black John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What power?\" Laurel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance countered with a question. \"How did Adam happen to find the skull, exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t an accident,\" Diana said. \"He was out looking for the Master Tools . . .\" She stopped. \"The Master Tools,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The ones that belonged to the original coven, the real Salem witches. Our ancestors who founded New Salem after the witch hunters drove them out of Salem Village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was speaking out loud before she\" thought. \"But just what were the Master Tools, exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Granny Quincey who answered. \"The symbols of the witch leader, of course. The diadem, the bracelet, and the garter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones we use are just imitations,\" Melanie said. \"They are just symbols. The original coven\u0027s were very powerful; real tools to be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, Aunt Constance\" - she turned back to her aunt - \"it was Black John who hid the Master Tools. Adam\u0027s been looking for them for years, from here to Cape Cod. How can we find them now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" the woman said. \"But you\u0027ve got one thing wrong there. Black John didn\u0027t hide them, the original coven did. They hid the tools from him, so he wouldn\u0027t be able to use them. They knew that with the power of the skull and the tools together, he would be invincible. That\u0027s what my grandmother told me, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t have taken the tools far to hide,\" Granny Quincey added. \"That\u0027s just sense. Black John was a traveler, but our ancestors weren\u0027t. They were peaceable, home-loving people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came for our advice - well, that\u0027s mine,\" Aunt Constance said. \"Find the Master Tools. If you all stand together, using those, you may have a chance against him.\" Her lips were a thin line again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Adam said slowly. \"We understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie let her breath out, trying not to feel disappointed. It was good advice, but she\u0027d hoped - for what? For her own grandmother, she supposed. She wanted her grandmother, who had been so wise, and had somehow always made Cassie feel as if she were stronger than she\u0027d thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And keep reading that book your grandma gave you!\" Granny Quincey said suddenly, looking right at Cassie. Cassie nodded and the old woman gave her a wrinkled but oddly intense smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Franklin was smiling too, patting her knees and looking around as if she\u0027d forgotten something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s tomorrow?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Cassie wasn\u0027t sure if Adam\u0027s grandmother was speaking to them or to herself. But then she repeated, \"What\u0027s tomorrow?\" looking at them encouragingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh - our birthday,\" Chris offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Diana looked startled. \"I think - I think it\u0027s the night of Hecate,\" she said. \"Is that what you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" old Mrs. Franklin said comfortably. \"Oh, when I was young, we would have done a ceremony. I remember ceremonies under the moon, when there were Indians in the shadows.. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlances were exchanged. Mrs. Franklin couldn\u0027t possibly remember that; there hadn\u0027t been Indians around here for centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Diana was getting excited. \"You think we should have a ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would, dear,\" Mrs. Franklin said. \"A girls\u0027 ceremony. We girls always had our secrets, didn\u0027t we, Connie? And we stuck together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana looked a little puzzled, then nodded slowly, determinedly. \"Yes. Yes. It would be good for the girls to get together - all the girls. And I think I know what kind of ceremony to have. It\u0027s not the right time of year, but that doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027ll enjoy it, dear,\" Mrs. Franklin said. \"Now let me see - Cassie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked at her, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie,\" Adam\u0027s grandmother said again. Her head was on one side, and she was sighing, the way you do when somebody shows you a picture of smiling baby. \"Dear me, you are a pretty little thing, though you don\u0027t look at all like your mother. Still - \" She broke off suddenly and looked around. \"Hm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat-aunt Constance was looking more severe than ever, her snapping eyes right on Mrs. Franklin. \"Edith,\" she said, in a flat voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Franklin looked at Granny Quincey, who was also staring at her with great concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why - I was only going to say I could see a bit of her mother in her expression,\" she said, and nodded at Cassie pleasantly. \"You try not to worry so much, dear. It\u0027ll all come right in the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Constance relaxed almost imperceptibly. \"Yes. That\u0027s all, Melanie; you\u0027d better take your friends away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that. The eleven of them got up and said thank you and good-bye politely, and then they were outside the big white house in the thin November sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whew!\" said Cassie. \"Adam, do you know what was going on there at the end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Adam said, grimacing. \"She gets like that sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t her so much as the other two,\" Cassie began, but Deborah broke in, impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s this night of Hecate thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the night of the crone,\" Diana said. \"That\u0027s what Hecate stands for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crone?\" Suzan echoed in distaste, and Cassie knew what she meant. The word conjured up an unpleasant image - a stooped, wrinkled figure holding up a poisoned apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Diana looked at Cassie. \"It\u0027s not a bad thing, Cassie. Crone just means old woman - it\u0027s the last stage in a woman\u0027s life. Maiden, mother, then crone. Crones are wise and - well, tough. Not physically, maybe, but mentally. They\u0027ve seen a lot; they\u0027ve been through it, and they know things. They\u0027re the ones who pass things on to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like my grandmother,\" Cassie said, understanding dawning. Of course - that stooped, wrinkled figure was the very picture of her grandmother. Not a poisoned apple, then, she thought. If her grandmother offered anything to anybody, it was help. \"Fairy tales give us the wrong idea,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Diana nodded firmly. \"When I\u0027m old I hope I\u0027m a crone like your grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want,\" Doug said, rolling his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all trying to help,\" Melanie said. \"Even Aunt Constance. But what are we going to do for the night of Hecate, Diana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a night for fortune-telling and prophecies,\" Diana said, \"and we have to find a crossroads where we can celebrate it. Hecate was the Greek goddess of crossroads - they\u0027re supposed to symbolize transformation. Starting on a new passage of life. It could be old age, or death, or some other kind of change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re all at a crossroads,\" Melanie said soberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do too.\" Diana looked at Adam. \"I think your grandmother was right; this is something we girls should do. But that\u0027ll leave you guys alone ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam grinned. \"Oh, I guess we could manage to amuse ourselves for one night without you. Maybe Chris and Doug have some ideas.\" He spoke easily; Cassie had noticed that all the guys in the Circle were undisturbed by the girls\u0027 rights and privileges. They didn\u0027t feel threatened; they seemed to know that they were just as important, in a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I think you should be very careful,\" Nick said, without a trace of humor in his voice. Chris and Doug were punching each other, arguing about how they wanted to celebrate their birthday. When Nick spoke they shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027d better find a crossroads right near here,\" Nick went on, speaking to Diana and Cassie. \"And that we\u0027d better not be too far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked into his face, saw the concern behind the careful control in his eyes. She took his hand, felt his strong fingers interlace with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be careful,\" she promised quietly. She saw Deborah\u0027s sharp glance at their linked hands, saw a knowing grin flash across the biker girl\u0027s face. Chris was poking Doug, who was glowering indignantly. Melanie\u0027s normally cool gray eyes were wide, and Laurel and Suzan were smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie couldn\u0027t help but notice that Adam was not smiling. He didn\u0027t smile again the rest of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Cassie had dreams. Swirling, formless dreams that seemed to have something to do with Books of Shadows. She and Diana had been up late, reading and studying. They hadn\u0027t found anything helpful. But in Cassie\u0027s dreams she felt she was on the verge of a momentous discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught a glimpse of the sunlit room again. Just a swift bright flash that melted almost instantly into darkness. She found herself awake, staring around Diana\u0027s bedroom as if she might find it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie,\" Diana murmured. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Cassie whispered. She was glad when Diana went still again. Diana was the one who\u0027d insisted Cassie sleep with her, worried about Cassie having nightmares. But if Cassie really started disturbing Diana she couldn\u0027t let herself stay here anymore. She was enough trouble to Diana without keeping her up all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Cassie had slept very peacefully in the Meade house. It wasn\u0027t like Number Twelve, which had groaned and popped so much in settling that Cassie had been constantly jolted awake. Some difference in the way the houses were made, she supposed. The additions to Diana\u0027s house were much newer; perhaps they\u0027d used better materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie lay for a while in the warm darkness, listening to Diana\u0027s soft breathing. Where was Black John tonight? she wondered. Out there on the mainland in his rented cottage? Or here, on the island of New Salem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason thinking of New Salem as an island upset her. She felt - isolated, somehow: besieged. As if Black John could cut all of them off from the rest of the world and cast them adrift on the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be silly, she told herself. But the threads of panic churning in her stomach wouldn\u0027t be stilled. She wondered suddenly if her mother wouldn\u0027t be better off in an institution - away from here. Anywhere away from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no reason for him to hurt her. It\u0027s us he hates, she thought desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had come after her grandmother. Why? For the Book of Shadows?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m the one who has the Book of Shadows now, she realized with a sick lurch of heart. What if he decides to come and take it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought grabbed hold of her imagination. She could feel the bed quiver with the pounding of her heart. What if Black John were to come here, now? He was a living, breathing man - but he was also a witch. Was he bound by the rules of other men? Or could he come sliding in here like a shadow, crawling along the floor toward the bed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to stay calm. I have to. If I crack up, it\u0027s all over. For Mom, for the coven, for everyone. It\u0027s going to take all of us to fight him. I can\u0027t be the weak link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing frightening in the dark if you just face it,\" she whispered to herself between clenched teeth. \"There is nothing frightening in the dark if you just face it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurning tears spilled out of her eyes, but she kept on whispering her grandmother\u0027s phrase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn and on until at last she fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next school day began with an assembly. Faye hadn\u0027t been in her normal seat in writing class again, but as Cassie filed into the auditorium she was astonished to see the dark-haired girl up by the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye was standing quietly, almost demurely -\u0026nbsp; for Faye. She was wearing a tailored suit and looked like a very smart, very sexy secretary. Her mane of dark hair was piled up softly on her head, and she was carrying a stack of papers and a clipboard. All she needed was a pair of hornrimmed glasses and she could have been some billionaire\u0027s girl Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie couldn\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around the auditorium and caught sight of Suzan and Sean, who both had the same remedial-English class first period. She jerked her chin at them and they split off from their class and joined her. Suzan\u0027s blue eyes were enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see Faye? What\u0027s she doing up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Cassie said. \"Nothing good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She looks good,\" Sean said, wetting his lips quickly. \"She looks great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie glanced at Sean, really noticing him for the first time in a long time. Since she\u0027d danced with him at the Halloween dance, maybe. It was so easy to overlook Sean; in a crowd he just seemed to blend in. But here, with only him and Suzan beside her, Cassie focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should pay more attention to him, she thought. An image skittered through her mind: Sean as he had appeared the first time she\u0027d seen him. Shiny eyes, shiny belt engraved with his name. Standing by his locker full of Soloflex ads, grinning at her. Something about the picture disturbed her profoundly, but she couldn\u0027t think what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of the junior and senior classes were coming into the auditorium. Cassie saw the Henderson brothers and Deborah sitting down with their history class. There was Diana and Melanie and Laurel from British Literature, and Sally Waltman, too, with the now-familiar straw-colored head of Portia Bainbridge next to her. She saw Adam and his chemistry class, but didn\u0027t spot Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like Faye\u0027s doing a little extracurricular activity,\" a voice behind her murmured, and Cassie turned gratefully. Nick nodded at the guy who was occupying the seat there, and the guy scrambled up and left. Cassie hardly noticed the occurrence, it was so common. The kids from Crowhaven Road indicated what they wanted, and the outsiders gave it to them. Always. It was the way things worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick sat in the vacated chair and took out a pack of cigarettes. He opened it, shook one forward. Then he noticed Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was staring at him with her eyebrows lifted, her best Diana expression on. Disapproval radiating from her like heat waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" Nick said. He glanced at the cigarettes, then at her again. He tapped the protruding cigarette back into place and tucked the pack in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad habit,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Testing, one, two, three . . .\" It was Faye\u0027s voice over the microphone. Cassie turned quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s on,\" Faye said, with a smile Cassie could only describe as kittenish. Faye moved away from the lectern, and the tall man also standing onstage walked up to it. He adjusted it, his eyes on the crowd of seated students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" he said, and his voice sent waves of darkness crashing through Cassie. Every muscle in her body tightened defensively, ready to obey some deeply buried instinct to fight or flee. Just his voice, she thought dazedly, how can someone\u0027s voice alone do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As some of you already know, I\u0027m Mr. Brunswick, your new principal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-6.html","bookId":2097,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:49 PM"}
