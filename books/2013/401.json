He wiped them away. ‘The horse-warrior,’ he said. ‘The Mezla.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHetan saw her husband’s head slowly turn at that word, saw his eyes fix on the Awl warrior, then watched as a cascade of realizations took hold of Tool’s expression, ending with a terrible scream as he brought his hands to his face, then fell to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was suddenly at his side, cradling his head against her belly as he loosed another piercing cry, clawing at his own face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Awl stared as if in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarghast warriors were rushing out from the line behind them, the young ones with their ancient single-edged hook-swords drawn, Tool’s most beloved whom he saw as his own children. Faces filled with consternation, with fear, they converged towards Tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHetan held out a hand, halted them all in their tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside the two of them now, drawing her panther skin about her shoulders, Kilava Onass. Her husband’s sister, whose heart held more sorrow and loss than Hetan could comprehend, who would weep every night as if it was ritually demanded of her with the sun’s setting. Who would walk out beyond the camp and sing wordless songs to the night sky-songs that would send the ay howling with voices of mourning and grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, now, on her brother’s right. But did not reach down a hand, did not even cast upon Tool a glance of sympathy. Instead, her dark eyes were scanning the Letherii army. ‘They prepare for us,’ she said. ‘The Tiste Edur join the ranks. The cavalry wait along the old shoreline. Onos Toolan, we are wasting time. You know I must leave soon. Very soon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTool drew himself from Hetan’s embrace. Saying nothing, he straightened, then began walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo where his friend had fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Awl warrior took a half-step towards him. ‘No!’ he shouted, turning pleading eyes upon Hetan. ‘He must not! The Mezla-he was a friend, yes? Please, he must not!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTool walked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Please! They cut off his face!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHetan flinched. ‘He knows,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Tool did halt, looking back, meeting Hetan’s eyes. ‘My love,’ he said in a ragged voice. ‘I do not understand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could but shake her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They betrayed him,’ Tool continued. ‘Yet, see. This day. He rode to the enemy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To save the lives of these children,’ Hetan said. ‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not understand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have told me many tales, husband, of your friend. Of Toe the Younger. Of the honour within him. I ask you this: how could he not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart came near to bursting as she gazed upon her beloved. These Imass-they were unable to hide anything they felt. They possessed none of the masks, the disguises, that were the bitter gifts of others, including her own Barghast. And they were without control, without mastery, which left grieving to wound the soul deeper than anything Hetan could imagine. As with grieving, so too love. So too friendship. So too, alas, loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They live,’ Tool then said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband turned and resumed his dreadful journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snort of impatience from Kilava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHetan walked over to the leather satchel the Awl warrior had discarded. She picked it up, slung it over one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kilava,’ she said. ‘Bonecaster. Lead our Barghast into this battle. I go down to my husband.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They will not-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t be absurd. Terror alone will ensure their obedience. Besides, the sooner they are done slaughtering, the sooner you will part our company.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sudden smile revealed a panther’s canines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSending a chill through Hetan. Thank the spirits you smile so rarely, Kilava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtri-Preda Bivatt had commanded her forces to withdraw from the seabed. Back onto more solid ground. Their triumph this day had grown sour with the taste of fear. Another damned army, and it was clear that they intended to do battle against her exhausted, bruised and battered forces. She had allowed herself but a few moments’ silent raging at the injustice, before forcing upon herself the responsibilities of her command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would fight with courage and honour, although as the barbaric enemy continued massing she could see that it would be hopeless. Seventy thousand, perhaps more. The ones who landed on the north coast, but also, perhaps, the rumoured allies of the Bolkando. Returned here to the north-but why? To join with the Awl? But for that, their main army had come too late. Bivatt had done what she had set out to do; had done what had been commanded of her. She had exterminated the Awl. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-401.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
