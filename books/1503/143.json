The two of them had been parted for months and had many things to talk about. Zhou Weiqing had just been calling Ming Yu cocky a minute ago, yet at that moment, he couldn’t help but brag to Shangguan Bing’er about his talent as a Consolidating Equipment Master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er listened to him with a faint smile on her face, being his best audience. Just as Zhou Weiqing was describing the pain he had been in during the breaking through of the twelfth Death Acupuncture Point, he was interrupted by a cry of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir gazes were drawn in the direction, only to see that the cry had originated from one of the queues of waiting students, and it had been one of the appliants taking the examination who had caused the outcry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe applicant was indeed eye-catching, as he was simply so huge. Zhou Weiqing’s 1.9 metre height and muscular frame was considered large amongst normal people, but when compared to that applicant, he was probably one size down!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be at least 2.1 metres tall, his well build body almost akin to a small hill! At the moment, he was saying: “Teacher, your attacks do not hurt at all! By the way, can I get full marks? I got 0 from the military examination, if I do not get full marks here, I’ll probably not be able to get in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teacher in charge of his examination said solemnly: “Applicant Ma Qun, release your Power Jewel and let me have a look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh okay.” The large youth called Ma Qun lifted his hands honestly and in a flash of light, a set of Heavenly Jewels appeared around his wrists. On the right, there was a yellow jade glowing, signifying toughness or defence. The purity of the yellow jade naturally showed his status as a Heavenly Jewel Master. As for his left wrist, there was a brilliant gold gemstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gold diamond, earth attribute!” Shangguan Bing’er gave a small cry of shock, saying with much surprise: “That is a good combination. The Earth Attribute is already very good for defence, and his Physical Jewel is also the toughness attribute. His defensive capabilities must be rather crazy! Such a combination of Heavenly Jewels is known as pure defense, and is even rarer than my pure agility type.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed and said: “Alas, his cultivation level is much lower than yours. After all, he is only a low level Shi Master with just a single set of Jewels, and is at max of 7th Level Heavenly Energy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two of them were chatting, the examiner said with a gloomy face: “Applicant Ma Qun, since you are a Heavenly Jewel Master, why did you attend the examinations? Don’t you know that no matter which academy, all Heavenly Jewel Masters can enter without examinations? Alright, you just need to register it here with me. Not bad, not bad, the crop of students this year is really good! You are already the second Heavenly Jewel Master this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh??” Three surprised voices rang out simultaneously. It was naturally Ma Qun, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er exchanged looks, bemusement and laughter well up within them. No wonder Hua Fen had not mentioned anything about the registration exams, since Heavenly Jewel Masters did not even need to take them. That was actually an even better treatment than nobles received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u0027er quickly walked up to the examiner and said: “Teacher, we are also Heavenly Jewel Masters, could you help us register as well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the other teachers and applicants turned to look at them, including the large Ma Qun turned around to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large fellow looked even more honest and naive than Zhou Weiqing, and as soon as he saw Shangguan Bing’er, he broke out in a grin and said: “Elder sis, you are so beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er smiled faintly and nodded to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked on coldly from the side. He noticed that this seemingly honest and naive big fellow was more than he looked - when he called Shangguan Bing’er beautiful, he noticeably swallowed a gulp of saliva. As a master of acting himself, Zhou Weiqing immediately spotted this fellow’s true colours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe examiners naturally did not notice such a minuscule detail, and after helping Ma Qun to register, the teacher said to them: “Please show me your Power Jewels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er did not reveal all their secrets - they both lifted up their respective right hands, using their bodies to block the view from the other applicants as they revealed their Physical Jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the waiting applicants heard an obvious string of breath intakes, but despite craning their necks, they were unable to see anything. As the teachers saw their both of them having three sets of Heavenly Jewels, they naturally kept their silence after that, rushing to help them register. Shangguan Bing’er looked at Zhou Weiqing in surprise, saying: “Little Fatty, you improved again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said with a bitter look: “I totally did not want to! I almost died at Teacher Huyan’s place. Without you by my side, breaking through the Death Acupuncture Points is just too painful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter just a short while, their registration was complete. The efficacy of the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy was extremely high, and the 3 of them received their entrance notifications immediately. The examiner also told them they could report 3 days later after all the entrance exams had ended and be assigned to their classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big sister, I’m called Ma Qun, what is your name? You’re so beautiful, you’re the most beautiful sister I have ever seen.” Just as Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u0027er were walking off from the personal combat strength examination area, the large Ma Qun had followed them, asking with an honest looking face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing\u0027er was about to reply him, but she was pulled aside by Zhou Weiqing who eyed the huge Ma Qun and said: “You big fool, in front of your big brother, your acting is too unskilled. Get lost, otherwise, I’ll beat you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty.” Shangguan Bing’er nudged him admonishingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa Qun laughed heartily, saying: “This big brother, I’m very tough, you can’t really beat me up, even if you are also a Heavenly Jewel Master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? I can’t beat you up?” Zhou Weiqing looked at him with interest. This time, Shangguan Bing’er seemed to know what was up, and didn’t make any further comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa Qun gave a foolish grin as he laughed and said: “How about we have a bet. If you can beat me up and hurt me, I’ll get lost. If not, you let me have this beautiful big sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed: “You have some audacity! No matter what, you do not lose. Haha… alright, it’s a rare moment that I will take the disadvantage in a bet, but I agree. Ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa Qun stood there, legs apart in a ready stance. He might look foolish and naive on the outside, but he was definitely not so, and was fully prepared, even releasing his Heavenly Jewels. The Earth Attribute Gold Diamond flashed, and a dim gold light surrounded his skin, and his already huge body seemed even larger than before, his skin seemingly rougher as well. “Alright, I am ready. Come then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Not bad, stone skin. In addition to your toughness Physical Jewel, that is not bad at all. Since you called me big brother, if I use my Heavenly Jewels, that would be bullying you too much. Look carefully, I am not using my Heavenly Jewels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he lifted his hands towards Ma Qun to see, and the instant that Ma Qun’s gaze landed on his wrists, Zhou Weiqing’s leg flashed out like lightning, his right leg smashing savagely into Ma Qun’s abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a huge *Bang*, that huge and heavy Ma Qun flew off even despite all his defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, he actually flew all the way back. His body being kicked into into a bow shape before flying back, and in a series of explosive sounds, the stone skin around his body actually shattered as he was knocked back almost 30 metres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, Zhou Weiqing disappeared from beside Shangguan Bing’er. By the time he reappeared, he was above Ma Qun’s flying body. Once again, the right leg flashed out, this time in a downward strike from above, once again smashing savagely into Ma Qun, this time onto his back. His body in midair instantly crashed down, landing heavily into the granite pavement. And, Ma Qun disappeared like that...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge commotion drew the attention of many standing around the main square as Zhou Weiqing landed gracefully on the ground. Indeed, he had not even unleashed his Heavenly Jewels, let alone any skills, and had only depended upon the terrifying strength and explosive power of the Demonic Right Leg. With a single blow of his leg, he had knocked Ma Qun back, before catching up with him and smashing him down with another blow. At this moment, Ma Qun’s hulking body was actually embedded inside the granite pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was standing on Ma Qun’s back, smiling as he said: “Big Fool, this big brother will teach you a lesson today. Liking women is not a bad thing, but don’t you try to target this big brother’s women. Tell me, does it hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days ago, when he saw Ming Yu and Difuya together, although Zhou Weiqing was a little gloomy, as Difuya was after all his fiancee in name, he did not really care a whole lot. However, when this big fellow was trying to put the moves on Bing’Er, that was not something he could stand. Shangguan Bing’er was the soft spot in his heart, and was his weakness! He wanted to kill off any notion in this Ma Qun’s heart before it could grow any further. To such a fellow who knew how to act and chase girls, the best way was to beat him till he was afraid of continuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it hurts. Big brother, I’m wrong.” Ma Qun lifted up his head, shaken. This fellow’s defense was indeed stunning though, despite being knocked right into the granite, his skin was not even bleeding at all. Of course, he was still hurting all over, especially that searing pain in his gut where Zhou Weiqing had kicked him, and at the moment he felt as if his insides were flip flopping around. Ever since his Heavenly Jewels had Awakened, he had never felt such a feeling. How could he not know that he had met someone he could not possibly deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing lifted up his leg, looking at the teachers running over, he quickly flipped Ma Qun up and out with his leg, patting the dust off Ma Qun’s body with a sincere smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” A teacher approached, asking angrily as he looked at the fearsome man-shaped hole in the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled faintly: “It’s nothing, we just got accepted into the academy, and were too excited. We were just sparring a little, right, Comrade Ma Qun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa Qun glanced at Zhou Weiqing, a strange expression on his face, but he immediately nodded and said: “Indeed! We were just sparring. Apologies teacher, I will pay for the broken granite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-40-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-41-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-40-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
