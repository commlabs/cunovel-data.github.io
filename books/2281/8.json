She was getting nothing from the body. If only Brady Laurie was still somehow here…but his body was cold. Empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is ridiculous. It’s…it’s not like he has massive bruising anywhere,” McFarland sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bruises may darken, giving us a better idea,” Kat said. “He hasn’t been dead that long,” she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He might not have gone ten rounds at the WWE SmackDown,” Will put in, “but it looks to me as if he was held in a firm grip shortly before his death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t make sense that one of his coworkers could have gotten angry enough to have killed him. It’s not like they’re out to claim the treasures for themselves,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” McFarland’s voice was strained. “What? A mummy crawled out of an inner sarcophagus and an outer sarcophagus—not to mention careful waterproofing—to rip his regulator out of his mouth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This man was the one who discovered the ship! He was alone down there,” McFarland emphasized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe—and maybe not,” Will said. “Others had to have known. Brady Laurie had done careful charting before the preservation group sent out requests for financial help, trying to sell their research as a documentary. This is the age of computer hackers, so plenty of people could’ve found out. And Lake Michigan hasn’t been closed, has it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat wanted to kick him for his sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agent Chan, I have been at this job for over twenty years,” McFarland began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat stepped in quickly. “Of course, Doctor, and your autopsy and notations are commendable. But there are factors involved that weren’t included in the information you were given. You had no reason to suspect foul play. But with the possibilities out there—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What possibilities? A curse! A swimming mummy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shrugged and replied casually, “No, I’m sure the mummy would have deteriorated if it had somehow come to life,” he said. “Money, Doctor. A treasure of inestimable worth. We don’t know if any other party discovered the wreck due to Brady’s research. It might have been a simple drowning. And then again, maybe not. At this point in the investigation, we have no idea who else might have been out on the lake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He died by drowning,” McFarland insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill raised his eyebrows. “Yes, he died by drowning. But whether it was accidental or not—that’s a completely different question, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re really suggesting he was murdered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m more than suggesting, I’m saying it’s quite likely,” Will said. “Your findings were absolutely correct, Dr. McFarland, except that…they weren’t. Brady Laurie was grabbed and he was held in the water. He drowned not because he ran out of time, but because his regulator was ripped from him. That’s why he has injuries on his lips.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young man, what you’re suggesting is a remote possibility!” McFarland said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remote? I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. McFarland, the point is…there is a possibility,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And not so remote,” Will added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Kat. He was challenging her to step up to the plate. She wasn’t in the least worried about doing that; she just wished she didn’t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at Will, who watched her steadily. And then, her heart sinking because she’d so badly wanted this to be nothing, she turned to McFarland. “Doctor, this is your morgue and your call. But…under the circumstances, I’d change that report if I were you. At the very least, hold on to it for a couple of days and let us do some more investigating. There’s a good possibility that this was willful death caused by person or persons unknown.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could you have been any ruder?” Kat demanded of Chan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could he have been any more incompetent?” he fired back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were out on the street. Car horns blared now and then, and the whir of fast-moving traffic seemed to be all around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat shook her head. “There’s still nothing to actually prove him wrong, Agent Chan. The bruise could conceivably have been caused by jostling around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never went to medical school, Agent Sokolov, but I don’t think you need a degree to recognize bruises on postmortem flesh. My fingers fit perfectly into those bruises, so I’d say whoever killed him had nice large hands. Brady Laurie wasn’t any kind of a hulk, although he was certainly strong enough to defend himself to some degree. But you dive, so surely you’re aware that a lack of oxygen can quickly deprive you of energy and skill, leaving only the instinct to survive—and fight against whatever is keeping you from breathing. An actor in a James Bond movie may be able to hold his breath forever while waging a heroic battle, but in most instances, you expend what air you have in trying to fight, and then…” He broke off, his implication grim. “And you agreed with my findings. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have said what you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe your findings suggest further investigation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beyond a doubt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But that would usually suggest not insulting the medical examiner to the point that he doesn’t want you back in the morgue! In any city, we need to be on the best terms with local authorities,” Kat told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Chan stared back at her for a moment, then shrugged. “All right, fine. I should have tiptoed around his feelings. We should have pleasantly gone along with him—and then he would’ve released the body and we’d be left with nothing. Well, excuse me. You can go back in and ask the good doctor out for coffee or drinks, but I’m headed to the police station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and started walking. Kat glared at him, her temper soaring. She decided to go after him and practically had to run to keep up with his long strides. She caught him by the arm and was surprised by her own strength when she spun him around to face her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, my team was the one called in. You just happened to be here. This is my investigation, and I need you to stop your high-handed behavior before you offend every cop in the city of Chicago, as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I offend a cop who’s dealt with a situation competently?” he asked. “And I’m sure you’ve been informed that I’ve already begun the investigation. I did so right after Logan Raintree got the request and called Jackson Crow and Adam Harrison with the information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. Except that you offended the medical examiner. Did you offend the film people, too? Or any of the others we’ll have to depend on for access and information?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t offended anyone, Agent Sokolov. What I did was conduct a very professional meeting with the film crew and then speak to the two researchers who worked with and found Mr. Laurie. I’ve politely informed them that we’ll be diving with them tomorrow. Unless, of course, you prefer to maintain your investigation here on the surface. I will certainly understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered what would happen if she simply combusted with anger on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agent Chan, it was my understanding that I was to examine the corpse at the request of the producer, Alan King, and that if I found anything I didn’t believe to be completely straightforward, then an investigation would begin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, Agent Sokolov, I was told last night to step right up and get things going since I was in the city. That’s what I did. When a body pops up, the first hours can be the most important—as you know—so time was of the essence. Would you like me to share what I’ve learned? Or would you rather let someone else die while you start your own investigation?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a professional, but I cannot work with this man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. “You do realize, Agent Chan, that we didn’t just go in and prove that Brady Laurie was murdered. Yes, it’s possible that he was held in some way while his regulator was ripped from him, but it’s not a foregone conclusion. There are other reasons such bruising might have occurred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evidence locker,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laurie’s dive gear is in an evidence locker down at the police station, since the police were with the rescue units when he was brought in. I’m going down there to meet up with the local investigator and see exactly how much air was left in Laurie’s tank.” He paused. “I was a day ahead of you—although, yes, it’s your case. I’ve seen the footage that was taken when the body was discovered. Laurie was dead when they found him, which wasn’t long after he’d gone down himself. I still can’t accept that it was a simple drowning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait—whoa! I didn’t know there was footage!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, there’s footage. And you can call Bernie right now, or you can take my word for it. I haven’t been to look at the evidence yet, but I intend to. You can get together with King Productions now or come with me and see the footage later. Your call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really wished it would be professional just to slap his determined and impatient face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother deep breath. “It’s my call, yes,” she said. “But I will come with you. As you pointed out, I can see the footage later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood his ground but seemed slightly taken aback, something of a smile almost curving his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not on opposing sides,” she said. “It doesn’t matter who makes what call. We’re here to find out if a murder has occurred, and if an investigation is necessary. I’m here for Brady Laurie, Agent Chan, not for a pissing contest with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow his lips did curve into a full smile. “Sorry. But the M.E.’s findings were just too easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, if there was no reason to suspect foul play, his findings really weren’t negligent.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unspoken-krewe-of-hunters-7/page-8.html","bookId":2281,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:17 PM"}
