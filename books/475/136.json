But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.\" (Dan. 10:12, 13)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe have wonderful teaching here on prayer, and we are shown the direct hindrance from Satan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDaniel had fasted and prayed twenty-one days, and had a very hard time in prayer. As far as we read the narrative, it was not because Daniel was not a good man, nor because his prayer was not right; but it was because of a special attack of Satan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord started a messenger to tell Daniel that his prayer was answered the moment Daniel began to pray; but an evil angel met the good angel and wrestled with him, hindering him. There was a conflict in the heavens; and Daniel seemed to go through an agony on earth the same as that which was going on in the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers…against wicked spirits in high places\" (Eph. 6:12, margin).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSatan delayed the answer three full weeks. Daniel nearly succumbed, and Satan would have been glad to kill him; but God will not suffer anything to come above that we \"are able to bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMany a Christian\u0027s prayer is hindered by Satan; but you need not fear when your prayers and faith pile up; for after a while they will be like a flood, and will not only sweep the answer through, but will also bring some new accompanying blessing. --Sermon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHell does its worst with the saints. The rarest souls have been tested with high pressures and temperatures, but Heaven will not desert them. --W. L.
