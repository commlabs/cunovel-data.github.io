She was an overstuffed kewpie doll fresh out of a Stephen King novel, but any sense of malevolence was dispelled by her obvious jollity. She laughed with good humor, and at the conclusion of the interview she stood up, leaned over, and kissed Danny Boy smack on the mouth. She laughed again and strode out of the place, and when she passed me I got a whiff of her perfume. It was as demure and understated as everything else about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to his table Danny Boy was dipping a white handkerchief in vodka and wiping his lips with it. \"Becky has a lovely mouth,\" he said, \"but God only knows where it\u0027s been. It\u0027s good to see you, Matthew. It\u0027s been too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time flies,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re having fun,\" he said, \"and also when you\u0027re not.\" He cocked his head, looked me over. \"You\u0027re looking well,\" he announced. \"Sobriety evidently agrees with you. I can\u0027t think it would agree with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his handkerchief away and took a big sip of vodka, churning it in his mouth like Listerine, then swallowing it down. \"Germs,\" he explained, \"though I\u0027m sure she tidies up after every little adventure. Still, better safe than sorry.\" At both Mother Blue\u0027s and Poogan\u0027s they leave the bottle for him, and he took it from the ice bucket and filled his glass. \"The only thing wrong with your sobriety,\" he said, \"is you don\u0027t get to the bars as often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m turning into a homebody,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how is the fair Elaine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. She sends her love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And give her mine.\" He picked up his glass, took a sip. He could still drink like a man twice his size and half his age. They say in the rooms of AA that it\u0027s just a question of time, that nobody gets away with it forever, but I\u0027m not sure they\u0027re right. Some friends of mine seem to do just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed and closed his eyes for a moment, and I could just about feel the drink going down. He opened his eyes and said, \"I\u0027d miss it,\" to himself as much as to me, and thought about that for a moment. Then his eyes found mine and he said, \"Well, Matthew? What brings you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home Elaine was in the living room, reading a Susan Isaacs novel and drinking a cup of tea. She was barefoot and wore a silk robe that left a lot of her uncovered. I looked her over and made some appreciative noises, and she told me that men are swine. \"It says so right here,\" she said, and tapped the book. \"How\u0027s Danny Boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same. He sends love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s sweet. Michael called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never calls,\" I said, remembering the last call I\u0027d had from him. \"What did he want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have called while we were at the concert. The message was on the machine when I got home. He wants you to call him, and he left a number. His cell phone, I think he said. The message is still on the machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went and played it. Without preamble he said, \"Dad, it\u0027s Michael. Could you give me a call? Anytime, it doesn\u0027t matter. I don\u0027t know where I\u0027ll be, so call me on my cell phone…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jotted down the number and went back to the living room. \"Whatever it is,\" I said, \"you don\u0027t get a clue from his tone of voice, do you? It\u0027s perfectly neutral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s probably an easy way to find out what he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost midnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is what, nine in California?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s in Paris,\" she said, \"it\u0027s six in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wherever you go,\" I said, \"it\u0027s always sometime. All I have to do is pick up the fucking phone, but I don\u0027t seem to want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But it might be good news, honey. Maybe June\u0027s expecting another baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it,\" I said, \"and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s good news. But whatever it is, I might as well hear about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" he said. \"Thanks for calling back. Listen, are you at home? The number I called before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, but- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me call you back. I\u0027m getting an echo on this piece of crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke the connection, and I hung up myself and waited for the phone to ring. I suppose I ought to have a cell phone, but there\u0027s not a day goes by that I\u0027m not glad I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine said, \"What happened?\" and I was starting to tell her when the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said. \"Listen, did Andy call you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think he would. He said he wasn\u0027t going to, but I thought he might have changed his mind. But I guess he didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Dad. He\u0027s got himself in a mess, that\u0027s all. He wouldn\u0027t call you, and he didn\u0027t want me to call you, but I felt I had to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of a mess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no great way to say this. He took some money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stole it, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically, yes. I don\u0027t think he thought of it that way, but when you take money from your employer that you can\u0027t pay back, I guess that\u0027s stealing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whole slew of questions came to mind. I reached out and picked one. \"How much money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From his employer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the company he works for, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know who he works for,\" I said, \"or what he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re an independent auto parts wholesaler. Andy\u0027s a sort of branch manager of the Tucson operation, services some accounts, does some back office work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t sound like a business that would handle much cash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s all checks. The way he did it, I don\u0027t know the details, but he evidently set up some dummy accounts and cut company checks payable to them. Then he set up a bank account where he could deposit the checks, and wrote checks from that account and cashed them through his own account.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s one way to do it, and it always works like a charm until they catch you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His boss found out, and- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I can\u0027t believe he was that stupid. Anyway, his boss gave him a choice. If he pays the money back before the end of the month he\u0027ll let it go. Otherwise he\u0027ll press charges, and Andy\u0027ll go to jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ten thousand\u0027s the amount he took?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what it rounds off to, and that\u0027s what he has to pay back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he called you asking for the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the one he calls,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has happened before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly? Meaning what, it wasn\u0027t auto parts and it wasn\u0027t in Tucson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was never this serious. He calls me, I don\u0027t know, every once in a while. Once or twice a year, I guess. Whenever it\u0027s him on the phone, I know he\u0027s in some kind of a jam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s broke, he needs money, something didn\u0027t work out. His car died and he has to get it fixed. He borrowed money from people who break your legs if you don\u0027t pay. It\u0027s always something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know anything about this, Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m always the one he calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you bail him out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, like I said, it was never this serious. It\u0027s usually a thousand dollars. Sometimes it\u0027s less, and the most it ever was was twenty-five hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He calls and you send the money. Does he ever pay you back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every once in a while I\u0027ll get a check or a money order in the mail, part of what he owes me. And he\u0027s very generous at Christmas. Since Melanie was born, there\u0027s always an expensive gift for her, at Christmas and on her birthday. But as far as how we stand, well, you don\u0027t like to keep accounts with your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to know where you stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I keep track, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he into you for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something around twelve thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve thousand,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel funny saying it. June doesn\u0027t know how much it comes to. She knows I give Andy money from time to time, but not what it adds up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no idea. I knew he was drifting, taking his time finding himself, never staying in one place too long. But it sounds like he\u0027s a fuckup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s Andy, Dad. He\u0027s charming, he\u0027s funny, everybody likes him. But yeah, I don\u0027t like to say it, but he\u0027s a fuckup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does it go, Mike? Gambling? Cocaine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was betting basketball games for a while, I remember that. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027s a serious gambler. I know he\u0027s done coke from something he said once, but just in the sense that he\u0027ll take some if he\u0027s out partying, more or less to keep going. I gather there are a lot of people who do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise all those other people wouldn\u0027t be getting rich selling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He took the ten thousand because he had this investment opportunity. I forget what it was, some new business he could buy a half-interest in if he could come up with ten grand. As a matter of fact he called me, wanted me to invest in it. I didn\u0027t pay attention to the details because I never considered it for a minute. We don\u0027t have a lot of extra dough to invest, but when we do it goes in an index fund. No glamour there, but I like that a lot better than the idea of waking up one morning and the money\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t borrow from you, so he borrowed from his boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how he saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he made the investment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the deal fell apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what happened to the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He pissed it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was depressed because he had high hopes, you know. He\u0027s always got high hopes. But he was down, so he got to drinking, and he decided he had to spend some money to cheer himself up. He took a girl to Cancъn, he traded his car for a new one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now he pays up or goes to jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, I didn\u0027t know what to tell him. \u0027Mikey, I swear this is the last time, I learned a big lesson here.\u0027 What am I supposed to say, you\u0027re full of shit and I know you\u0027re full of shit? \u0027Mikey, you\u0027ll get it back.\u0027 Yeah, right. I work my ass off, June works as hard as I do, we got the kid, we got the house…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could I give him ten grand? Yes, I could. I\u0027d have to sell some securities, take out a loan, but I could do it. Am I going to?\" He paused, as if considering the question anew. \"I said it was too much. I said I could manage half of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wouldn\u0027t do it. His boss told him if he presses charges, then his insurance company covers the loss. So if the guy settled for half he\u0027d have to eat a five-thousand-dollar loss, and he\u0027s not willing to do that. Andy said if all I can send him is half I should just wire it to him, because what he\u0027ll do is take the money in cash and run with it. I told him I didn\u0027t think that was such a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may be the worst idea he\u0027s ever had in his life,\" I said, \"although I\u0027m beginning to realize that covers a lot of ground. The last thing he wants to do is make himself a fugitive from justice.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-24.html","bookId":2333,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM"}
