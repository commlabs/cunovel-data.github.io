Her countenance bore the marks of hardship and exposure; while the coarse material of her scanty garments, which scarcely served to defend her from the bleak December wind, showed that even now she wrestled with poverty for life. In one hand she carried a small pitcher, while with the other she leaned heavily on her oaken stick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She has come for her milk,\" said little Cornelia, who ran out and took the pitcher from the woman\u0027s hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me help you, Auntie, you walk so slow,\" said she.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come in and warm yourself, Judy,\" said Mrs. Ford, \"it is cold and damp, and you must be tired. How have you been these two or three days?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Purty well, thank ye, but I\u0027se had a touch of the rheumatiz, and I find I isn\u0027t so strong as I was,\" said Judy, as she drew near the grate, in which blazed and crackled the soft coal of the West, in a manner both beautiful and comforting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Ford busied herself in preparing a basket of provisions, and had commenced wrapping the napkin over it, when she paused and leaned toward the closet, into which she looked, but did not seem to find what she wanted, for, calling one of the boys, she whispered something to him. He ran out into the yard and down the path to the barn; presently he returned and said,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There are none there, mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am very sorry, Judy, that I have not an egg for you, but our hens have not yet commenced laying, except Sissy\u0027s little bantam,\" said Mrs. Ford.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now Cornelia had a little white banty, with a topknot on its head and feathers on its legs, which was a very great pet, of course; and Sissy had resolved to save all banty\u0027s eggs, so that she might hatch only her own chickens. \"For,\" said she, \"if she sets on other hen\u0027s eggs, when the chickens grow big they will be larger than their mother, and then she will have so much trouble to make them mind her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, when she heard her mother wish for an egg, the desire to give one to Judy crossed her mind, but it was some moments before she could bring herself to part with her cherished treasure. Soon, however, her irresolution vanished, and she ran quickly to her little basket, and taking out a nice fresh egg, she laid it in Judy\u0027s hand, saying,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There, Judy, it will make you strong.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Ford marked with a mother\u0027s eye the struggle going on in the mind of her daughter, but determined not to interfere, but let her decide for herself, unbiased by her mother\u0027s wishes or opinions. And when she saw the better feeling triumph, a tear of exquisite pleasure dimmed her eye, for in that trifling circumstance she saw the many trials and temptations of after life prefigured, and hoped they would end as that did, in the victory of the noble and generous impulses of the heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the basket was ready, and Aunt Judy regaled with a nice cup of tea, one of the boys volunteered to carry it home for her, a proposal which was readily assented to by Mrs. Ford, whose heart was gladdened by every act of kindness to the poor and needy performed by her children, and who had early taught them that in such deeds they obeyed the injunction of our Saviour: \"Bear ye one another\u0027s burdens.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2469/68314.html","bookId":555,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:25:04 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:25:04 PM"}
