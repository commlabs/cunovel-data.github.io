{"id":21311,"no":60,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Reuben came away from Cheat Land with odd feelings of annoyance, perplexity, and exhilaration. Alice Jury was queer, and she had insulted him, nevertheless those ten minutes spent with her had left him tingling all over with a strange excitement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could not account for it. Women had excited him before, but merely physically. He took it for granted that they had minds and souls like men, but he had not thought much about that aspect of them or allowed it to enter his calculations. Of late he had scarcely troubled about women at all, having something better to think of.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now he found himself thrown into a kind of dazzle by Alice Jury. He could not explain it. Her personal[Pg 214] beauty was negligible—\"a liddle stick of a thing,\" he called her; their conversation had been limited almost entirely to her tactless questions and his forbearing answers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She ?un\u0027t my sort,\" he mumbled as he walked home, \"she ?un\u0027t at all my sort. Dudn\u0027t know where Odiam wur—never heard of Boarzell—oh, yes, seems as she remembered hearing something when I t?ald her\"—and Reuben\u0027s lip curled ironically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had not told her of his ambitions with regard to Boarzell, and now he found himself wishing that he had done so. He had been affronted by her ignorance, but as his indignation cooled he longed to confide in her. Why, he could not say, for unmistakably she \"wasn\u0027t his sort\"; it was not likely that she would sympathise, and yet he wanted to pour all the treasures of his hope into her indifference. He had never felt like this towards anyone before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He spent the day restlessly, and the next morning walked over to Cheat Land before half-past ten. Alice Jury opened the door, and looked surprised to see him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You said you were coming at eleven. I\u0027m afraid father\u0027s out again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wur passing this way, so thought I\u0027d call in on the chance,\" said Reuben guiltily—\"I d?an\u0027t mind waiting.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She called a long-legged boy who was weeding among the turnips, and bade him go over to Puddingcake and fetch the master. Then she led the way to the kitchen, which smelled deliciously of baking bread.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t mind if I go on with my baking? I\u0027ve twelve loaves in the oven.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no,\" said Reuben, sitting in yesterday\u0027s chair, and gazing up at the Rossetti.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you like pictures?\" asked Alice, thumping dough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some,\" said Reuben, \"but I like \u0027em coloured best.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I paint a little myself,\" said Alice—\"when I\u0027ve time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot sort o\u0027 things do you paint?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, landscapes mostly. That\u0027s mine\"—and she pointed to a little water-colour sketch of a barn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Could you paint a picture of Odiam?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I expect I could—not really well, you know, just something like this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Could you paint Boarzell?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He leaned towards her over the back of his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I dare say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Could you do it wud all the colours on it and all that?—all the pinks you git on it sometimes, and the lovely yaller the gorse m?akes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was surprised at his enthusiasm. His eyes were kindling, and a blush was creeping under his sunburn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I could try! Do you want a picture of Boarzell?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d like one if you could really do it to look natural.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She smiled. \"Perhaps I could. But why do you think so much of Boarzell?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because I\u0027m going to m?ake it mine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yours!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes—I mean to have the whole of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But can you grow anything on a waste like that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can. I\u0027ve got near a hundred acres sown already\" ... and then all the floodgates that had been shut for so long were burst, and the tides of his confidence rolled out to her, moaning—all the ache of his ambition which nobody would share.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her eyes were fixed on him with their strange spell, and her sharp little face was grave. He knew that she did not sympathise—he had not expected it. But he was glad he had told her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her first words startled him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think it\u0027s worth while?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot\u0027s worth while?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"To give up so much for the sake of a piece of land.\" Reuben gaped at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve no right to preach to you; but I think I may be allowed to ask you—\u0027is it worth while?\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was too flabbergasted to be angry. The question had simply never come into his experience. Many a man had said, \"Do you think you\u0027ll do it?\" but no one had ever said, \"Do you think it\u0027s worth while?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice saw her blunder. She saw that she had insulted his ambition; and yet, though she now understood the ferocities of that ambition, it filled her with a definite hostility which made her want to fight and fight and fight it with all the strength she had. At the same time, as his surprise collapsed, his own antagonism rose up. He felt a sudden hatred, not for the girl, but for the forces which somehow he knew she was bringing to oppose him. They faced each other, their eyes bright with challenge, their breasts heaving with a stormier, earthlier emotion—and the white flame of antagonism which divided them seemed at the same time to fuse them, melt them into each other.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59432.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
