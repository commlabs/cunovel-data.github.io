There was light stretched like skin over her pain, but it was thin and fast fraying.

It struck the base of the marble banister at the top of the stairs, and the crack echoed sharp as a split skull before the huge vessel tilted and pitched down the steps. Shattering, it flung its shards in a glistening spray down the stone flight all the way to the main floor. Sparkling dust spun and twisted for a time, before settling like flecks of frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal walked over to the edge of the steps and looked down. ‘That,’ he said under his breath, ‘was rather spectacular.’ He turned at a sound behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Brevity was leaning out from the doorway, glancing round until she spotted Withal. ‘You’d better come in,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was doing just that,’ he replied. ‘Five strides closer and she’d be a widow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrevity made a face he couldn’t quite read, and then edged to one side to let him pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throne room was still a chamber of ghosts. Black stone and black wood, the crimson and onyx mosaic of the floor dulled with dust and dried leaves that had wandered in from some high window. It seemed to hold nothing of the now brimming power of the Teronderai, the holy sepulchre of Mother Dark, yet for all that Withal felt diminished as he stepped through the side entrance and edged out towards the centre of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throne was on his right, raised on a knee-high dais that was, he realized, the vast stump of a blackwood tree. Roots snaked down to sink into the surrounding floor. The throne itself had been carved from the bole, a simple, almost ascetic chair. Perhaps it had once been plush, padded and bold in rich fabrics, but not even the tacks remained. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-60.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
