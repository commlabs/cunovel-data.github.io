Jamie sat with me. He patted my back now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWes was already buried in the dark grotto beside Walter. He had died four days ago, the night that Jared and Ian and I had sat watching the family in the park. I would never see my friend again, never hear his voice...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears splashed on the stone beneath me, and Jamie\u0027s pats increased in tempo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy and Paige were not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d driven the truck and the van back to their hiding places. They would take the jeep from there to its usual rough garage, and then they\u0027d have to walk the rest of the way home. They would be back before sunrise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily was not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not... doing so well,\" Jamie had murmured when he\u0027d caught me scanning the room for her. I didn\u0027t want to know any more. I could imagine well enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron and Brandt were not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt now bore a smooth, pink, circular scar in the hollow space beneath his left collarbone. The bullet had missed his heart and lungs by a hair and then burrowed halfway through his shoulder blade trying to escape. Doc had used most of the Heal getting it out of him. Brandt was fine now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWes\u0027s bullet had been better aimed. It had pierced his high olive-skinned forehead and blown out the back of his head. There was nothing Doc could have done, even if he\u0027d been right there with them, a gallon of Heal at his disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt, who now carried in a holster on his hip a boxy, heavy trophy from the encounter, was with Aaron. They were in the tunnel where we would have stored our spoils if it had not been occupied. If it was not being used as a prison again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if losing Wes was not enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed hideously wrong to me that the numbers remained the same. Thirty-five living bodies, just like before I\u0027d come to the caves. Wes and Walter were gone, but I was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now so was the Seeker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Seeker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027d just gone straight to Tucson. If I had just stayed in San Diego. If I had just skipped this planet and gone somewhere entirely different. If I\u0027d given myself as a Mother like anyone else would have after five or six planets. If, if, if... If I had not come here, if I had not given the Seeker the clues she needed to follow, then Wes would be alive. It had taken her longer than me to figure them out, but when she did, she didn\u0027t have to pursue them with caution. She\u0027d barreled through the desert in an all-terrain SUV, leaving bright new scars across the fragile desert landscape, each pass getting closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to do something. They had to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had killed Wes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey still would have caught me in the first place, Wanda. I led them here, not you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too miserable to answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, if we hadn\u0027t come here, Jamie would be dead. And maybe Jared, too. He would have died tonight, without you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath on every side. Death everywhere I looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did she have to follow me? I moaned to myself. I\u0027m not hurting the other souls here, not really. I\u0027m even saving some of their lives by being here, by keeping Doc from his doomed efforts. Why did she have to follow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did they keep her? Mel snarled. Why didn\u0027t they kill her right away? Or kill her slow-I don\u0027t care how! Why is she still alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear fluttered in my stomach. The Seeker was alive; the Seeker was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t have been afraid of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it made sense to be afraid that her disappearance would bring the other Seekers down on us. Everyone was afraid of that. Spying on the search for my body, the humans had seen how vocal she was about her convictions. She\u0027d been trying to convince the other Seekers that there were humans hiding in this desert wasteland. None seemed to take her seriously. They had gone home; she was the only one who kept looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now she\u0027d vanished in the middle of her search. That changed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer vehicle had been moved far away, left in the desert on the other side of Tucson. It looked as though she\u0027d disappeared in the same way it was believed I had: pieces of her bag left torn nearby, the snacks she\u0027d carried with her chewed open and scattered. Would the other souls accept such a coincidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe already knew they would not. Not entirely. They were looking. Would the search become more intense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to be afraid of the Seeker herself... That didn\u0027t make much sense. She was physically insignificant, probably smaller than Jamie. I was stronger and faster than she was. I was surrounded by friends and allies, and she, inside these caves at least, was all alone. Two guns, the rifle and her own Glock-the very gun Ian had once envied, the gun that had killed my friend Wes-were trained on her at every moment. Only one thing had kept her alive until now, and it couldn\u0027t save her for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb had thought I might want to talk to her. That was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I was back, she was condemned to die within hours whether I spoke to her or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why did I feel as though I was at the disadvantage? Why this strange premonition that she would be the one to walk away from our confrontation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t decided if I wanted to talk to her. At least, that was what I\u0027d told Jeb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a doubt, I did not want to talk to her. I was terrified to ever see her face again-a face that, no matter how I tried, I could not imagine looking frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if I told them I had no desire for conversation, Aaron would shoot her. It would be like I\u0027d given him the order to fire. Like I\u0027d pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr worse, Doc would try to cut her out of the human body. I flinched away from the memory of the silver blood smeared all over the hands of my friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie twisted uneasily, trying to escape the torment in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanda? They\u0027re just going to shoot her. Don\u0027t panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould this comfort me? I couldn\u0027t avoid the imagined tableau. Aaron, the Seeker\u0027s gun in his hand; the Seeker\u0027s body slowly crumpling to the stone floor, the red blood pooling around her...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t have to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wouldn\u0027t stop it from happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie\u0027s thoughts became a little frantic. But we want her to die. Right? She killed Wes! Besides, she can\u0027t stay alive. No matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right about everything, of course. It was true that there was no way the Seeker could stay alive. Imprisoned, she would work doggedly to escape. Freed, she would quickly be the death of all my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true she had killed Wes. He was so young and so loved. His death left a burning agony in its wake. I understood the claim of human justice that demanded her life in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also true that I wanted her to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda? Wanda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie shook my arm. It took me a moment to realize that someone had called my name. Perhaps many times already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda?\" Jeb\u0027s voice asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up. He was standing over me. His face was expressionless, the blank facade that meant he was in the grip of some strong emotion. His poker face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boys want to know if you have any questions for the Seeker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put one hand to my forehead, trying to block the images there. \"If I don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re ready to be done with guard duty. It\u0027s a hard time. They\u0027d rather be with their friends right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Okay. I guess I\u0027d better... go and see her at once, then.\" I shoved myself away from the wall and to my feet. My hands were shaking, so I clenched them into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t have any questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll think of some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy prolong the inevitable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re trying to save her, Melanie accused, full of outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no way to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. There isn\u0027t. And you want her dead anyway. So let them shoot her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, not trusting my voice enough to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to,\" Jeb told me, his eyes sharp on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s hand wrapped around mine, but I shook it off. \"Stay here, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice was stronger now. \"Oh, no, you will not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other for a moment, and for once I won the argument. He stuck his chin out stubbornly but slouched back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan, too, seemed inclined to follow me out of the kitchen, but I stopped him in his tracks with a single look. Jared watched me go with an unfathomable expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a complainer,\" Jeb told me in a low voice as we walked back toward the hole. \"Not quiet like you were. Always asking for more-food, water, pillows... She threatens a lot, too. ��The Seekers will get you all!\u0027 That kinda thing. It\u0027s been hard on Brandt especially. She\u0027s pushed his temper right to the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. This did not surprise me one bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hasn\u0027t tried to escape, though. A lot of talk and no action. Once the guns come up, she backs right down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recoiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My guess is, she wants to live pretty dang bad,\" Jeb murmured to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure this is the... safest place to keep her?\" I asked as we started down the black, twisting tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb chuckled. \"You didn\u0027t find your way out,\" he reminded me. \"Sometimes the best hiding place is the one that\u0027s in plain sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy answer was flat. \"She\u0027s more motivated than I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boys\u0027re keepin\u0027 a sharp eye on her. Nothin\u0027 to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were almost there. The tunnel turned back on itself in a sharp V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many times had I rounded this corner, my hand tracing along the inside of the pointed switchback, just like this? I\u0027d never traced along the outside wall. It was uneven, with jutting rocks that would leave bruises and cause me to trip. Staying on the inside was a shorter walk anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they\u0027d first showed me that the V was not a V but a Y-two branches forking off from another tunnel, the tunnel-I\u0027d felt pretty stupid. Like Jeb said, hiding things in plain sight was sometimes the cleverest route. The times I\u0027d been desperate enough to even consider escaping the caves, my mind had skipped right over this place in my speculations. This was the hole, the prison. In my head, it was the darkest, deepest well in the caves. This was where they\u0027d buried me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Mel, sneakier than I was, had never dreamed that they\u0027d held me captive just a few paces from the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t even the only exit. But the other was small and tight, a crawl space. I hadn\u0027t found that one because I\u0027d walked into these caves standing upright. I hadn\u0027t been looking for that kind of tunnel. Besides, I\u0027d never explored the edges of Doc\u0027s hospital; I\u0027d avoided it from the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice, familiar even though it seemed part of another life, interrupted my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder how you\u0027re still alive, eating like this. Ugh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething plastic clattered against the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the blue light as we rounded the last corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know humans had the patience to starve someone to death. That seems like too complex a plan for you shortsighted creatures to grasp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb chuckled. \"Gotta say, I\u0027m impressed with those boys. Surprised they held up this long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned into the lit dead-end tunnel. Brandt and Aaron, both sitting as far as possible from the end of the tunnel where the Seeker paced, both with guns in their hands, sighed with relief when they saw us approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally,\" Brandt muttered. His face was etched in hard lines of grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seeker halted in her pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised to see the conditions she was kept in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not stuffed into the tiny cramped hole, but comparatively free, stomping to and fro across the short width of the tunnel. On the floor, against the flat end of the tunnel, were a mat and a pillow. A plastic tray was tilted at an angle against the wall at about the midpoint of the cave; a few jicama roots lay scattered near it with a soup bowl. A little soup was splattered out from where that lay. This explained the clatter I\u0027d just heard-she\u0027d thrown her food. It looked as though she\u0027d eaten most of it first, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at this relatively humane setup and felt an odd pain in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho did we kill? Melanie muttered sullenly. This stung her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a minute with her?\" Brandt asked me, and the pain stabbed again. Had Brandt ever referred to me using a feminine pronoun? I wasn\u0027t surprised that Jeb had done this for the Seeker, but everyone else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Aaron cautioned. \"She\u0027s an angry little thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others stayed where they were. I walked down the tunnel alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to lift my eyes, to meet the gaze that I could feel like cold fingers pressing against my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seeker was glaring at me, a harsh sneer twisting her features. I\u0027d never seen a soul use that expression before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hello there, Melanie,\" she mocked me. \"What took you so long to come visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I walked toward her slowly, trying hard to believe that the hate coursing through my body really did not belong to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did your little friends think I would talk to you? Spill all my secrets because you carry a gagged and lobotomized soul around in your head, reflecting through your eyes?\" She laughed abrasively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped two long strides away from her, my body tensed to run. She made no aggressive move toward me, but I could not relax my muscles. This was not like meeting the Seeker on the highway-I didn\u0027t have the usual sensation of safety that I felt around the gentle others of my kind. Again, the strange conviction that she would live long after I was gone swept through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be ridiculous. Ask her your questions. Have you come up with any?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what do you want? Did you request permission to kill me personally, Melanie?\" the Seeker hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They call me Wanda here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched slightly when I opened my lips to speak, as if expecting me to shout. My low, even voice seemed to upset her more than the scream she anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI examined her face while she glared at me with her bulging eyes. It was dirty, stained with purple dust and dried sweat. Other than that, there wasn\u0027t a mark on it. Again, this gave me an odd ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda,\" she repeated in a flat voice. \"Well, what are you waiting for? Didn\u0027t they give you the okay? Were you planning to use your bare hands or my gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not here to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sourly. \"To interrogate me, then? Where are your instruments of torture, human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed. \"I won\u0027t hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsecurity flickered across her face and then vanished behind her sneer. \"What are they keeping me for, then? Do they think I can be tamed, like your pet soul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They just... they didn\u0027t want to kill you until they had... consulted me. In case I wanted to talk to you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lids lowered, narrowing her protruding eyes. \"Do you have something to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"I was wondering...\" I only had the same question I\u0027d been unable to answer for myself. \"Why? Why couldn\u0027t you let me be dead, like the rest of them? Why were you so determined to hunt me down? I didn\u0027t want to hurt anyone. I just wanted... to go my own way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaped up onto her toes, shoving her face toward mine. Someone moved behind me, but I couldn\u0027t hear more than that-she was shouting in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I was right!\" she shrieked. \"More than right! Look at them all! A vile nest of killers, lurking in wait! Just like I thought, only so much worse! I knew you were out here with them! One of them! I told them there was danger! I told them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, panting, and took a step back from me, staring over my shoulder. I didn\u0027t look away to see what had made her retreat. I assumed it had something to do with what Jeb had just told me-once the guns come up, she backs right down. I analyzed her expression for a moment as her heavy breathing slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they didn\u0027t listen to you. So you came for us alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seeker didn\u0027t answer. She took another step back from me, doubt twisting her expression. She looked oddly vulnerable for a second, as if my words had stripped away the shield she\u0027d been hiding behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll look for you, but in the end, they never believed you at all, did they?\" I said, watching as each word was confirmed in her desperate eyes. It made me very sure. \"So they won\u0027t take the search further than that. When they don\u0027t find you, their interest will fade. We\u0027ll be careful, as usual. They won\u0027t find us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I could see true fear in her eyes for the first time. The terrible-to her-knowledge that I was right. And I felt better for my nest of humans, my little family. I was right. They would be safe. Yet, incongruously, I didn\u0027t feel any better for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no more questions for the Seeker. When I walked away, she would die. Would they wait until I was far enough not to hear the shot? Was there anywhere in the caves that was far enough for that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her angry, fearful face, and I knew how deeply I hated her. How much I never wanted to see that face again for the rest of my lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hate that made it impossible for me to allow her to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how to save you,\" I whispered, too low for the humans to hear. Why did that sound like a lie in my ears? \"I can\u0027t think of a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want to? You\u0027re one of them!\" But a spasm of hope sparked in her eyes. Jeb was right. All the bluster, all the threats... She wanted very much to stay alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded at her accusation, a little absently because I was thinking hard and fast. \"But still me,\" I murmured. \"I don\u0027t want... I don\u0027t want...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to finish that sentence? I didn\u0027t want... the Seeker to die? No. That wasn\u0027t true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want... to hate the Seeker? To hate her so much that I wanted her to die. To have her die while I hated her. Almost as if she died because of my hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I truly did not want her death, would I be able to think of a way to save her? Was it my hate that was blocking an answer? Would I be responsible if she died?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you insane? Melanie protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d killed my friend, shot him dead in the desert, broken Lily\u0027s heart. She\u0027d put my family in danger. As long as she lived, she was a danger to them. To Ian, to Jamie, to Jared. She would do everything in her power to see them all dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s more like it. Melanie approved of this train of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if she dies, and I could have saved her if I\u0027d wanted to... who am I then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to be practical, Wanda. This is a war. Whose side are you on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know the answer to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do. And that\u0027s who you are, Wanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut... but what if I could do both? What if I could save her life and keep everyone here safe at the same time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy wave of nausea rolled in my stomach as I saw the answer I\u0027d been trying to believe didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only wall I\u0027d ever built between Melanie and me crumbled to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Mel gasped. And then screamed, NO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer I must have known I would find. The answer that explained my strange premonition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I could save the Seeker. Of course I could. But it would cost me. A trade. What had Kyle said? A life for a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seeker stared at me, her dark eyes full of venom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-50.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
