{"id":23138,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. HOW DR. FOX WAS FOOLED.","content":"N ANCY was not likely to turn pale, even if she had been frightened. Really, however, she was not frightened, having considerable nerve.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that you, Massa Fox?\" she replied composedly, pushing the boat off at the same time. \"Where did you come from?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who have you got with you?\" demanded the doctor, in a peremptory tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lor\u0027, doctor, what\u0027s the matter? It\u0027s my sister Chloe from \u0027cross the river. She cum over to see me yes\u0027day, and I\u0027m agwine to take her home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Fox surveyed the pretended sister critically, and was inclined to believe the story. The dress, the stuffed form, and general appearance certainly resembled Nancy. But he was not satisfied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you sure that you haven\u0027t got one of my runaways in the boat with you?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nancy\u0027s fat sides shook with laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One of them crazy critters!\" she exclaimed. \"Chloe, he thinks you\u0027re a crazy critter run away from his \u0027sylum. Won\u0027t Dinah laugh when you tell her!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Kenyon possessed an admirable talent for mimicry, though she had not exercised it much of late years. Now, however, the occasion seemed to call for an effort in that direction, and she did not hesitate. She burst into a laugh, rich and hearty, so like Nancy\u0027s that the latter was almost startled, as if she heard the echo of her own amusement. No one who heard it would have doubted that it was the laugh of a negro woman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The laugh convinced Dr. Fox. He no longer entertained any doubt that it was really Nancy\u0027s sister.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all right, Nancy,\" he said apologetically. \"I see I am mistaken. If you see either of the runaways let me know,\" and he turned his horse from the bank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not a word passed between Nancy and her passenger till they had got beyond earshot of the pursuer. Then Nancy began:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You did dat well, Mis\u0027 Kenyon. Ef I hadn\u0027t knowed I\u0027d have thought it was ole Chloe herself. Where did you learn dat laugh?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I might make a pretty good actress, Nancy,\" said Mrs. Kenyon, smiling. \"I knew something must be done as Dr. Fox\u0027s suspicions were aroused. But I didn\u0027t dare to speak. I was not so sure of my voice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lor\u0027, how we fooled Massa Fox!\" exclaimed Nancy, bursting once more into a rollicking laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So we did,\" said Mrs. Kenyon, echoing the laugh as before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You almost frighten me, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" said Nancy. \"I didn\u0027t think no one but a nigger could laugh like dat. Are you sure you aint black blood?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think not, Nancy,\" said Mrs. Kenyon. \"I don\u0027t look like it, do I?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mis\u0027 Kenyon; you\u0027re as white as a lily; but I can\u0027t understand dat laugh nohow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently they reached the other shore, and Nancy securely fastened the boat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How far is it to the depot, Nancy?\" asked the runaway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only \u0027bout a mile, Mis\u0027 Kenyon. Are you tired?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no; and if I were, I wouldn\u0027t mind, so long as I am escaping from that horrible asylum. I can\u0027t help thinking of that poor Cleopatra. I wish she might be as fortunate as I, but I am afraid she will be taken back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She an\u0027 you\u0027s different, Mis\u0027 Kenyon. She\u0027s crazy, an\u0027 you aint.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you think I can be trusted out of the doctor\u0027s hands?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How came you there, anyway, Mis\u0027 Kenyon?\" asked Nancy curiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is too long a story to tell, Nancy. It is enough to say that I was put there by a cruel enemy, and that since I have been confined I have met with a great loss.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you lose your money, Mis\u0027 Kenyon?\" asked Nancy sympathetically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was worse than that, Nancy. My only boy is dead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dat\u0027s awful; but brace up, Mis\u0027 Kenyon. De Lor\u0027 don\u0027t let it blow so hard on de sheep dat\u0027s lost his fleece.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I feel that I have very little to live for, Nancy,\" continued Mrs. Kenyon, in a tone of depression.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you take it so much to heart, Mis\u0027 Kenyon. I\u0027ve had three chil\u0027en myself, an\u0027 I don\u0027t know where they is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How does that happen, Nancy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When we was all slaves dey was sold away from me, down in Alabama, I reckon, and I never expec\u0027 to see any of \u0027em ag\u0027in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is very hard, Nancy,\" said Mrs. Kenyon, roused to sympathy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So it is, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" said Nancy, wiping her eyes; \"but I hope to see \u0027em in a better land.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Nancy, pausing in her rowing, began to sing in an untrained but rich voice a rude plantation hymn:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027se all a-goin\u0027,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027se all a-goin\u0027,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027se all a-goin\u0027,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To de Promised Land.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We shall see our faders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We shall see our moders,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We shall see our chil\u0027en,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dead an\u0027 gone before us,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In de Promised Land.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you cry, poor sinner,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t you cry, poor sinner,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027se all a-goin\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To de Promised Land.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It makes me feel better to sing them words, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" said Nancy; \"for it\u0027s all true. De Lord will care for us in de Promised Land.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am glad you have so much faith, Nancy,\" said her companion. \"Your words cheer me, in spite of myself. For the first time, I begin to hope.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dat\u0027s right, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" said Nancy, heartily. \"Dat\u0027s de way to talk.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were walking while this conversation took place, and soon they reached the stationâ€”a small rude hut, or little better.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A man with a flag stood in front of it, while a gentleman and lady were standing just in the door-way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Kenyon had on the way disencumbered herself of the gown and other disguises which she had worn in the boat, and appeared a quiet, lady-like figure, who might readily be taken for a Southern matron, with a colored attendant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When will the next train start, sir?\" she asked, addressing the flagman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In five or ten minutes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Going South?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can I get a ticket of you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The ticket agent is away. You will have to buy one on board the train.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They went into the small depot and waited till the train arrived. Then Mrs. Kenyon bade a hurried good-by to Nancy, pressed another piece of gold into her not unwilling hand, and was quickly on her way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the train started she breathed a sigh of relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At last I feel that I am free!\" she said to herself. \"But where am I going and what is to be my future life?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were questions which she could not answer. The future must decide.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nancy bent her steps toward her humble home, congratulating herself on the success with which their mutual plans had been carried out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder how Miss Clopatry is gettin\u0027 along,\" she reflected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We can answer that question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Fox, on his way back, thought he would again visit Nancy\u0027s cottage. The two refugees might possibly be in the neighborhood, although he no longer suspected Nancy\u0027s connivance with them. He was destined to be gratified and at the same time disappointed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he approached the house he caught sight of Cleopatra looking out of the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that you, Antony?\" she called.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Fox\u0027s face lighted up with satisfaction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There they are! I\u0027ve got them!\" he exclaimed, and quickened his horse\u0027s pace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Open the door, Cleopatra!\" he ordered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She meekly obeyed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He peered round for her companion, but saw no one else.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is Antony?\" asked Cleopatra.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is Mrs. Kenyon?\" he demanded sternly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Gone away with Nancy,\" answered Cleopatra simply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Fox swore fearfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then it was she!\" he exclaimed, \"after all; and I have been preciously fooled. I\u0027d like to wring Nancy\u0027s neck!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is Antony?\" asked Cleopatra anxiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is at the asylum, waiting to see you,\" said the doctor. \"Come with me, and don\u0027t keep him waiting!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was enough. Poor Cleopatra put on her bonnet at once, and went back with the doctor, only to weep unavailing tears over the disappointment that awaited her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d rather it was the other one,\" muttered Dr. Fox. \"Who would have thought she was so cunning? Where did she get that laugh? I\u0027d swear it was a nigger!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For three months Nancy was not allowed any work from the asylum, but she contented herself with the fifteen dollars in gold which Mrs. Kenyon had given her.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59237.html","bookId":527,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM"}
